Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order\n   - Create parallel execution examples per user story\n   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)\n\n4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:\n   - Correct feature name from plan.md\n   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)\n   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)\n   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)\n   -

Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)\n   - Setup phase: NO story label\n   - Foundational phase: NO story label  \n   - User Story phases: MUST have story label\n   - Polish phase: NO story label\n5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)\n- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)\n\n### Task Organization\n\n1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:\n   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase\n   - Map all related components to their story:\n     - Models needed for that story\n     - Services needed for that story\n     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story\n     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story\n   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)\n\n2. **From Contracts**:\n   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves\n   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase\n\n3. **From Data Model**:\n   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it\n   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase\n   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase\n\n4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:\n   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)\n   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)\n   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase\n\n### Phase Structure\n\n- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)\n- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)\n- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)\n  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration\n  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment\n- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n"}]}}

Feature Specification: Logging System\\n\\n**Feature Branch**: `007-logging-system-structured`  \\n**Created**: 2025-10-08  \\n**Status**: Draft  \\n**Input**: User description: \\\"Structured logging with multiple output formats and levels\\\"\\n\\n## Clarifications\\n\\n### Session 2025-11-01\\n\\n- Q: How should this feature integrate with existing loguru usage? → A: Extend existing loguru configuration and add structured output handlers\\n- Q: What happens when log destination becomes unavailable (disk full, network down)? → A: Log to fallback destination (stderr/console) + emit warning\\n- Q: How does system handle extremely high-volume logging that exceeds buffer capacity? → A: Drop oldest buffered entries + increment drop counter\\n- Q: What threading model should async logging use? → A: Single background thread + bounded queue with drop policy (loguru native)\\n- Q: How do users configure and update logging settings? → A: Environment variables + optional config file\\n\\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### User Story 1 - Structured Log Output (Priority: P1)\\n\\nDevelopers and operators need structured logs (JSON, key-value pairs) instead of plain text to enable automated parsing, querying, and analysis in log aggregation systems.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Core logging capability - enables modern observability practices and log analysis.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating logs and verifying they are formatted as structured data (JSON/structured text).\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** logging is configured, **When** event occurs, **Then** log entry contains structured fields (timestamp, level, message, context)\\n2. **Given** JSON format selected, **When** logs are written, **Then** each entry is valid JSON with consistent schema\\n3. **Given** structured logs, **When** queried, **Then** fields can be extracted and filtered programmatically\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 2 - Configurable Log Levels (Priority: P1)\\n\\nUsers need to control logging verbosity via levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to balance detail with performance and storage costs.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Essential for production use - prevents log flooding while ensuring critical issues are captured.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting different log levels and verifying only appropriate messages are logged.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** log level set to INFO, **When** DEBUG messages are generated, **Then** DEBUG messages are not logged\\n2. **Given** log level set to ERROR, **When** INFO messages are generated, **Then** only ERROR and CRITICAL messages appear\\n3. **Given** log level changes at runtime, **When** configuration reloads, **Then** new level takes effect immediately\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 3 - Multiple Output Destinations (Priority: P2)\\n\\nOperations team needs to send logs to multiple destinations simultaneously (console, file, syslog, remote aggregator) for different monitoring and archival purposes.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Operational flexibility - supports different monitoring workflows and compliance requirements.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring multiple outputs and verifying logs appear in all destinations.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** console and file outputs configured, **When** log event occurs, **Then** log appears in both console and file\\n2. **Given** remote logging enabled, **When** logs are generated, **Then** logs are sent to remote endpoint (syslog, HTTP)\\n3. **Given** output destination fails, **When** logging continues, **Then** other destinations continue receiving logs\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 4 - Contextual Logging with Metadata (Priority: P2)\\n\\nDevelopers need to attach contextual metadata (request ID, user ID, proxy URL, operation) to log entries for correlation and debugging.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Debugging efficiency - enables tracing request flows and correlating related log entries.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging with context and verifying metadata appears in log entries.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** request context, **When** logging occurs, **Then** request ID is included in log entry\\n2. **Given** proxy operation, **When** error is logged, **Then** proxy URL and operation type are included\\n3. **Given** nested operations, **When** logging occurs, **Then** full context hierarchy is preserved\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 5 - Log Rotation and Retention (Priority: P2)\\n\\nSystem administrators need automatic log file rotation by size or time with configurable retention policies to manage disk space.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Production requirement - prevents disk exhaustion and maintains log history.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating logs until rotation threshold and verifying old files are rotated/archived.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** rotation size limit of 100MB, **When** log file reaches limit, **Then** file is rotated and new file is created\\n2. **Given** daily rotation configured, **When** day changes, **Then** log file is rotated with timestamp\\n3. **Given** retention of 7 days, **When** log files are older than 7 days, **Then** ol\\n[... output truncated to fit 10240 bytes ...]\\n\\n\\n- **FR-001**: System MUST extend existing loguru configuration with structured output handlers (JSON, logfmt)\\n- **FR-002**: System MUST support standard log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) via loguru\\n- **FR-003**: System MUST allow runtime log level configuration without restart (via environment variables

This is the simplest method and provides a rich default set of fields (`time`, `level`, `message`, `record`, `extra`, etc.).\\n\\n2.  **Custom Serialization**: For more fine-grained control over the JSON schema, Loguru allows providing a custom serialization function. This function receives the log record and can return a dictionary with a specific structure, which Loguru then serializes to JSON. This is ideal for standardizing log formats and integrating with specific log aggregation platforms.\\n\\n3.  **Contextual Data**: Loguru's `bind()` method allows attaching arbitrary contextual data to log records, which is automatically included in the `extra` field of the serialized JSON. This is a powerful feature for adding request IDs, user IDs, and other metadata.\\n\\n4.  **No Direct Comparison Found**: The research did not yield a direct comparison showing a significant advantage of using `python-json-logger` *with* Loguru. Loguru's native capabilities appear to cover the primary use cases for structured logging.\\n\\n## Decision\\n\\n**Decision**: We will **not** add `python-json-logger` as a dependency. We will implement structured JSON formatting using Loguru's built-in `serialize=True` feature, in combination with a custom serialization function to define a standardized JSON schema.\\n\\n**Rationale**:\\n\\n*   **Avoids a New Dependency**: This approach avoids adding an unnecessary dependency to the project, keeping the dependency footprint smaller.\\n*   **Leverages Existing Library**: It makes full use of the features already provided by `loguru`, which is an existing dependency.\\n*   **Sufficiently Powerful**: Loguru's native serialization is flexible enough to meet all the feature requirements, including custom schemas and contextual metadata.\\n*   **Simplicity**: Using the built-in features is more straightforward than integrating and managing another library.\\n\\n## Alternatives Considered\\n\\n*   **Using `python-json-logger`**: This would have involved creating a custom Loguru handler that uses `python-json-logger` for formatting. This was deemed an unnecessary layer of complexity.\\n*   **Manual JSON Formatting in `format`**: Manually constructing a JSON string in the `format` parameter of the sink is error-prone and less flexible than using the `serialize` feature.\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

Re-check after Phase 1 design.*\\n\\n| Principle | Status | Evidence |\\n|-----------|--------|----------|\\n| **I. Library-First Architecture** | ✅ PASS | Extends existing loguru library configuration. All functionality usable via Python import. No CLI/web dependencies required. Type hints with `py.typed` marker. |\\n| **II. Test-First Development** | ✅ PASS | TDD workflow enforced in tasks.md (to be created). Unit tests for formatters, handlers, config. Integration tests for multi-destination logging. Property tests for concurrent logging. Target 85%+ coverage. |\\n| **III. Type Safety & Runtime Validation** | ✅ PASS | Pydantic models for LogConfiguration. Full type hints for all public APIs. mypy --strict compliance. Pydantic-settings for config validation. |\\n| **IV. Independent User Stories** | ✅ PASS | 6 user stories (US1-US6) each independently testable. US1 (structured output) can be implemented without US2-US6. No hidden dependencies between stories. |\\n| **V. Performance Standards** | ✅ PASS | Success criteria defined: <5% overhead (SC-003), 10k entries/sec (SC-005). Async logging with bounded queue prevents blocking. Benchmark tests required for validation. |\\n| **VI. Security-First Design** | ✅ PASS | FR-017 requires 100% credential redaction (SC-007). Use SecretStr for sensitive config. No credential exposure in structured logs. Thread-safe async queue. |\\n| **VII. Simplicity & Flat Architecture** | ✅ PASS | Extends existing loguru in proxywhirl/ (no new package). Adds ~2-3 modules: logging_config.py, logging_formatters.py, logging_handlers.py. Total modules: 19/20 (within limit). |\\n\\n**uv run Enforcement**: All Python commands will use `uv run` prefix per constitution (e.g., `uv run pytest tests/`).\\n\\n## Project Structure\\n\\n### Documentation (this feature)\\n\\n```text\\nspecs/007-logging-system-structured/\\n├── plan.md              # This file (/speckit.plan command output)\\n├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/speckit.plan command)\\n├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\\n├── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\\n├── contracts/           # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\\n│   └── logging-config-schema.json  # Pydantic model schema for configuration\\n└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/speckit.tasks command - NOT created by /speckit.plan)\\n```\\n\\n### Source Code (repository root)\\n\\n```text\\nproxywhirl/                    # Flat package structure (existing)\\n├── logging_config.py          # NEW: Pydantic-settings configuration models\\n├── logging_formatters.py      # NEW: JSON/logfmt structured formatters\\n├── logging_handlers.py        # NEW: Multi-destination handlers with fallback\\n├── config.py                  # EXISTING: May extend with logging settings\\n├── rotator.py                 # EXISTING: Will use structured logging\\n├── health.py                  # EXISTING (006): Will emit structured health logs\\n└── ...                        # Other existing modules\\n\\ntests/\\n├── unit/\\n│   ├── test_logging_config.py         # NEW: Config model validation\\n│   ├── test_logging_formatters.py     # NEW: JSON/logfmt formatting\\n│   └── test_logging_handlers.py       # NEW: Handler behavior, fallback\\n├── integration/\\n│   ├── test_logging_multi_dest.py     # NEW: Multiple outputs simultaneously\\n│   └── test_logging_rotation.py       # NEW: File rotation + retention\\n├── property/\\n│   └── test_logging_concurrency.py    # NEW: Hypothesis concurrent logging\\n└── benchmarks/\\n    └── test_logging_performance.py    # NEW: SC-003, SC-005 validation\\n```\\n\\n**Structure Decision**: Flat module structure per Constitution VII.

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

Feature Specification: Logging System\\n\\n**Feature Branch**: `007-logging-system-structured`  \\n**Created**: 2025-10-08  \\n**Status**: Draft  \\n**Input**: User description: \\\"Structured logging with multiple output formats and levels\\\"\\n\\n## Clarifications\\n\\n### Session 2025-11-01\\n\\n- Q: How should this feature integrate with existing loguru usage? → A: Extend existing loguru configuration and add structured output handlers\\n- Q: What happens when log destination becomes unavailable (disk full, network down)? → A: Log to fallback destination (stderr/console) + emit warning\\n- Q: How does system handle extremely high-volume logging that exceeds buffer capacity? → A: Drop oldest buffered entries + increment drop counter\\n- Q: What threading model should async logging use? → A: Single background thread + bounded queue with drop policy (loguru native)\\n- Q: How do users configure and update logging settings? → A: Environment variables + optional config file\\n\\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### User Story 1 - Structured Log Output (Priority: P1)\\n\\nDevelopers and operators need structured logs (JSON, key-value pairs) instead of plain text to enable automated parsing, querying, and analysis in log aggregation systems.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Core logging capability - enables modern observability practices and log analysis.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating logs and verifying they are formatted as structured data (JSON/structured text).\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** logging is configured, **When** event occurs, **Then** log entry contains structured fields (timestamp, level, message, context)\\n2. **Given** JSON format selected, **When** logs are written, **Then** each entry is valid JSON with consistent schema\\n3. **Given** structured logs, **When** queried, **Then** fields can be extracted and filtered programmatically\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 2 - Configurable Log Levels (Priority: P1)\\n\\nUsers need to control logging verbosity via levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to balance detail with performance and storage costs.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Essential for production use - prevents log flooding while ensuring critical issues are captured.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting different log levels and verifying only appropriate messages are logged.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** log level set to INFO, **When** DEBUG messages are generated, **Then** DEBUG messages are not logged\\n2. **Given** log level set to ERROR, **When** INFO messages are generated, **Then** only ERROR and CRITICAL messages appear\\n3. **Given** log level changes at runtime, **When** configuration reloads, **Then** new level takes effect immediately\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 3 - Multiple Output Destinations (Priority: P2)\\n\\nOperations team needs to send logs to multiple destinations simultaneously (console, file, syslog, remote aggregator) for different monitoring and archival purposes.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Operational flexibility - supports different monitoring workflows and compliance requirements.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring multiple outputs and verifying logs appear in all destinations.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** console and file outputs configured, **When** log event occurs, **Then** log appears in both console and file\\n2. **Given** remote logging enabled, **When** logs are generated, **Then** logs are sent to remote endpoint (syslog, HTTP)\\n3. **Given** output destination fails, **When** logging continues, **Then** other destinations continue receiving logs\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 4 - Contextual Logging with Metadata (Priority: P2)\\n\\nDevelopers need to attach contextual metadata (request ID, user ID, proxy URL, operation) to log entries for correlation and debugging.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Debugging efficiency - enables tracing request flows and correlating related log entries.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging with context and verifying metadata appears in log entries.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** request context, **When** logging occurs, **Then** request ID is included in log entry\\n2. **Given** proxy operation, **When** error is logged, **Then** proxy URL and operation type are included\\n3. **Given** nested operations, **When** logging occurs, **Then** full context hierarchy is preserved\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 5 - Log Rotation and Retention (Priority: P2)\\n\\nSystem administrators need automatic log file rotation by size or time with configurable retention policies to manage disk space.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Production requirement - prevents disk exhaustion and maintains log history.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating logs until rotation threshold and verifying old files are rotated/archived.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** rotation size limit of 100MB, **When** log file reaches limit, **Then** file is rotated and new file is created\\n2. **Given** daily rotation configured, **When** day changes, **Then** log file is rotated with timestamp\\n3. **Given** retention of 7 days, **When** log files are older than 7 days, **Then** ol\\n[... output truncated to fit 10240 bytes ...]\\n\\n\\n- **FR-001**: System MUST extend existing loguru configuration with structured output handlers (JSON, logfmt)\\n- **FR-002**: System MUST support standard log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) via loguru\\n- **FR-003**: System MUST allow runtime log level configuration without restart (via environment variables + optional config file reload)\\n- **FR-004**: System MUST support multiple simultaneous output destinations\\n- **FR-005**: System MUST support console, file, syslog, and HTTP remote logging outputs\\n- **FR-006**: System MUST include timestamp, log level, and message in all log entries\\n- **FR-007**: System MUST support contextual metadata attachment to log entries\\n- **FR-008**: System MUST provide request/operation correlation IDs in logs\\n- **FR-009**: System MUST implement automatic log file rotation by size\\n- **FR-010**: System MUST implement automatic log file rotation by time (daily, hourly)\\n- **FR-011**: System MUST support configurable log retention policies\\n- **FR-012**: System MUST support asynchronous logging with single background thread and bounded queue (using loguru's `enqueue=True`)\\n- **FR-013**: System MUST handle log destination failures gracefully (fallback to stderr/console with warning emission)\\n- **FR-014**: System MUST support custom log formatters and handlers\\n- **FR-015**: System MUST log all proxy operations (selection, request, failure, retry)\\n- **FR-016**: System MUST log health check events and status changes\\n- **FR-017**: System MUST support sensitive data redaction in logs (credentials, PII)\\n- **FR-018**: System MUST provide log filtering by component or module\\n- **FR-019**: System MUST support log sampling for high-volume scenarios\\n- **FR-020**: System MUST handle Unicode and special characters correctly in logs\\n- **FR-021**: System MUST track and expose dropped log count when buffer capacity exceeded (oldest entries dropped first)\\n\\n### Key Entities\\n\\n- **Log Entry**: Record of event with timestamp, level, message, metadata, and context (structured as JSON/logfmt)\\n- **Log Handler**: Output destination (console, file, remote) with formatter and filters (loguru handler with custom serializer)\\n- **Log Context**: Metadata attached to log entries (request ID, operation, proxy, user) via loguru's `bind()` and contextvars\\n- **Log Configuration**: Settings for levels, formats, outputs, rotation, and retention (environment variables + optional config file via pydantic-settings)\\n- **Log Rotation Policy**: Rules for when and how to rotate log files (loguru's rotation parameter with size/time triggers)\\n- **Drop Counter**: Metric tracking number of logs dropped when buffer capacity exceeded\\n\\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- **SC-001**: Structured logs can be parsed and queried in log aggregation tools\\n- **SC-002**: Log level changes take effect within 1 second of configuration update\\n- **SC-003**: Logging overhead adds less than 5% latency to proxy requests\\n- **SC-004**: Log rotation completes without data loss or corruption\\n- **SC-005**: System handles 10,000 log entries per second without blocking\\n- **SC-006**: Logs include correlation IDs for 100% of proxy operations\\n- **SC-007**: Sensitive data is redacted from 100% of log entries\\n- **SC-008**: Log files rotate within 1 minute of reaching size/time threshold\\n- **SC-009**: Multiple output destinations operate independently (one failure doesn't affect others)\\n- **SC-010**: Log retention policy cleanups execute within 5 minutes of schedule\\n\\n## Assumptions\\n\\n- Log storage has sufficient capacity for configured retention periods\\n- Operators configure appropriate log levels for their use case\\n- Remote log destinations (if used) are accessible and reliable (with fallback to local logging on failure)\\n- Log rotation thresholds are set reasonably based on log volume\\n- Application context for logging (request IDs, etc.) is properly maintained via contextvars\\n- Log parsing tools support JSON or logfmt structured formats\\n- Loguru library is already installed and configured in proxywhirl\\n- Environment variables are accessible for runtime configuration\\n- Bounded queue size is sufficient for typical log volumes (configurable via environment variable)\\n\\n## Dependencies\\n\\n- Core Python Package (001) for operation events to log\\n- Configuration Management (012) for logging settings via environment variables + config file\\n- Health Monitoring (006) for health event logging\\n- Metrics & Observability (008) for log volume and drop counter metrics\\n- Existing

See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nExtend proxywhirl's existing loguru-based logging with structured output formats (JSON, logfmt), configurable handlers (console, file, syslog, HTTP remote), and operational features (rotation, retention, async buffering, contextual metadata). Configuration via environment variables + optional config file using pydantic-settings. Single background thread for async logging with bounded queue and drop counter metrics. Graceful failure handling with fallback to stderr/console.\\n\\n## Technical Context\\n\\n**Language/Version**: Python 3.9+ (targeting 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13)\\n**Primary Dependencies**: \\n- loguru>=0.7.0 (already in dependencies - extend configuration)\\n- pydantic-settings>=2.0.0 (already in dependencies - for config management)\\n- Optional: python-json-logger for structured JSON formatting - NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Decide whether to use this library or implement JSON formatting manually.\\n\\n**Storage**: File system (rotated log files), optional remote endpoints (syslog, HTTP)\\n**Testing**: pytest (unit, integration, property tests with Hypothesis), pytest-benchmark for performance validation\\n**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS/Windows servers (cross-platform file handling)\\n**Project Type**: Single project (library extension)\\n**Performance Goals**: \\n- <5% logging overhead on proxy requests (SC-003)\\n- 10,000 log entries/second without blocking (SC-005)\\n- <1 second configuration reload (SC-002)\\n- Log rotation <1 minute of threshold (SC-008)\\n\\n**Constraints**:\\n- Must extend existing loguru usage (not replace)\\n- Async logging with bounded queue (prevent OOM)\\n- Thread-safe for concurrent proxy operations\\n- No credential exposure in logs (100% redaction, SC-007)\\n- Graceful degradation on destination failures\\n\\n**Scale/Scope**:\\n- Support high-volume production logging (10k+ entries/sec)\\n- Multiple simultaneous output destinations (4+ handlers)\\n- Large log files with rotation (100MB+ files, daily rotation)\\n- 24/7 operation with automatic retention cleanup\\n\\n## Constitution Check\\n\\n*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*\\n\\n| Principle | Status | Evidence |\\n|-----------|--------|----------|\\n| **I. Library-First Architecture** | ✅ PASS | Extends existing loguru library configuration. All functionality usable via Python import. No CLI/web dependencies required. Type hints with `py.typed` marker. |\\n| **II. Test-First Development** | ✅ PASS | TDD workflow enforced in tasks.md (to be created). Unit tests for formatters, handlers, config. Integration tests for multi-destination logging. Property tests for concurrent logging. Target 85%+ coverage. |\\n| **III. Type Safety & Runtime Validation** | ✅ PASS | Pydantic models for LogConfiguration. Full type hints for all public APIs. mypy --strict compliance. Pydantic-settings for config validation. |\\n| **IV. Independent User Stories** | ✅ PASS | 6 user stories (US1-US6) each independently testable. US1 (structured output) can be implemented without US2-US6. No hidden dependencies between stories. |\\n| **V. Performance Standards** | ✅ PASS | Success criteria defined: <5% overhead (SC-003), 10k entries/sec (SC-005). Async logging with bounded queue prevents blocking. Benchmark tests required for validation. |\\n| **VI. Security-First Design** | ✅ PASS | FR-017 requires 100% credential redaction (SC-007). Use SecretStr for sensitive config. No credential exposure in structured logs. Thread-safe async queue. |\\n| **VII. Simplicity & Flat Architecture** | ✅ PASS | Extends existing loguru in proxywhirl/ (no new package). Adds ~2-3 modules: logging_config.py, logging_formatters.py, logging_handlers.py. Total modules: 19/20 (within limit). |\\n\\n**uv run Enforcement**: All Python commands will use `uv run` prefix per constitution (e.g., `uv run pytest tests/`).\\n\\n## Project Structure\\n\\n### Documentation (this feature)\\n\\n```text\\nspecs/007-logging-system-structured/\\n├── plan.md              # This file (/speckit.plan command output)\\n├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/speckit.plan command)\\n├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\\n├── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\\n├── contracts/           # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\\n│   └── logging-config-schema.json  # Pydantic model schema for configuration\\n└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/speckit.tasks command - NOT created by /speckit.plan)\\n```\\n\\n### Source Code (repository root)\\n\\n```text\\nproxywhirl/                    # Flat package structure (existing)\\n├── logging_config.py          # NEW: Pydantic-settings configuration models\\n├── logging_formatters.py      # NEW: JSON/logfmt structured formatters\\n├── logging_handlers.py        # NEW: Multi-destination handlers with fallback\\n├── config.py                  # EXISTING: May extend with logging settings\\n├── rotator.py                 # EXISTING: Will use structured logging\\n├── health.py                  # EXISTING (006): Will emit structured health logs\\n└── ...                        # Other existing modules\\n\\ntests/\\n├── unit/\\n│   ├── test_logging_config.py         # NEW: Config model validation\\n│   ├── test_logging_formatters.py     # NEW: JSON/logfmt formatting\\n│   └── test_logging_handlers.py       # NEW: Handler behavior, fallback\\n├── integration/\\n│   ├── test_logging_multi_dest.py     # NEW: Multiple outputs simultaneously\\n│   └── test_logging_rotation.py       # NEW: File rotation + retention\\n├── property/\\n│   └── test_logging_concurrency.py    # NEW: Hypothesis concurrent logging\\n└── benchmarks/\\n    └── test_logging_performance.py    # NEW: SC-003, SC-005 validation\\n```\\n\\n**Structure Decision**: Flat module structure per Constitution VII.

Performance-Optimized Logging (Priority: P3)\\n   101\\t\\n   102\\tHigh-throughput applications need asynchronous logging that doesn't block main execution threads, ensuring logging overhead doesn't impact proxy performance.\\n   103\\t\\n   104\\t**Why this priority**: Performance optimization - prevents logging from becoming a bottleneck.\\n   105\\t\\n   106\\t**Independent Test**: Can be tested by measuring request latency with and without logging and verifying minimal impact.\\n   107\\t\\n   108\\t**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n   109\\t\\n   110\\t1. **Given** async logging enabled, **When** log entry is created, **Then** logging call returns immediately without blocking\\n   111\\t2. **Given** high log volume, **When** system is under load, **Then** logging overhead is under 5% of total CPU time\\n   112\\t3. **Given** log queue full, **When** new logs are generated, **Then** system handles gracefully (drop or block based on policy)\\n   113\\t\\n   114\\t---\\n   115\\t\\n   116\\t### Edge Cases\\n   117\\t\\n   118\\t- **Log destination unavailable** (disk full, network down): Log to fallback destination (stderr/console) and emit warning (maintains observability during infrastructure issues)\\n   119\\t- **High-volume logging exceeds buffer**: Drop oldest buffered entries and increment drop counter metric (bounded memory, preserves recent logs)\\n   120\\t- **Log rotation during active writes**: Use atomic file operations and write locks to ensure no data loss\\n   121\\t- **Multiple processes writing to same file**: Use process-safe file handlers with advisory locks (loguru's `enqueue=True` provides this)\\n   122\\t- **Structured log serialization fails** (circular references, large objects): Fall back to string representation and log serialization error\\n   123\\t- **Logging from crash/signal handlers**: Use synchronous logging for critical paths (avoid async queue)\\n   124\\t- **Retention policy conflicts with active files**: Skip active files, only clean up closed/rotated files\\n   125\\t\\n   126\\t## Requirements *(mandatory)*\\n   127\\t\\n   128\\t### Functional Requirements\\n   129\\t\\n   130\\t- **FR-001**: System MUST extend existing loguru configuration with structured output handlers (JSON, logfmt)\\n   131\\t- **FR-002**: System MUST support standard log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) via loguru\\n   132\\t- **FR-003**: System MUST allow runtime log level configuration without restart (via environment variables + optional config file reload)\\n   133\\t- **FR-004**: System MUST support multiple simultaneous output destinations\\n   134\\t- **FR-005**: System MUST support console, file, syslog, and HTTP remote logging outputs\\n   135\\t- **FR-006**: System MUST include

Library-First Architecture\n+- All new functionality ships as importable Python modules inside the existing `proxywhirl` package unless the plan explicitly approves a new project.\n+- Modules MUST remain self-contained, composable, and typed (`py.typed` marker required).\n+- Features MAY expose CLIs or APIs, but the library layer is the canonical contract.\n+\n+### II. Test-First Development (Non-Negotiable)\n+- Red-Green-Refactor workflow is mandatory for every change.\n+- Tests MUST be authored or updated before implementation and must fail prior to code changes.\n+- Unit, integration, property, and benchmark suites are required when referenced by the spec or success criteria.\n+\n+### III. Type Safety & Runtime Validation\n+- Production code MUST pass `mypy --strict`.\n+- Runtime configuration MUST be validated using pydantic (or approved equivalent).\n+- Public interfaces require precise type hints; no `Any` escapes except documented third-party integrations.\n+\n+### IV. Independent User Stories\n+- Every user story must deliver value in isolation with clear acceptance criteria and tests.\n+- Plans and tasks MUST ensure stories can be implemented in parallel without hidden cross-story dependencies.\n+- Shared prerequisites belong in Setup/Foundational phases only.\n+\n+### V. Performance & Observability Standards\n+- Success criteria for latency, throughput, and error budgets MUST be measured and enforced via automated tests or benchmarks.\n+- Structured logging and metrics collection are mandatory for production features.\n+- Performance regressions above documented thresholds are release blockers.\n+\n+### VI. Security & Privacy by Default\n+- Sensitive data MUST be redacted in logs and persisted data.\n+- Secrets handling requires `SecretStr` (or equivalent) and audited storage.\n+- Error handling MUST avoid leaking credentials or internals.\n+\n+### VII. Simplicity & Flat Architecture\n+- Favor flat module structures over deep package trees.\n+- New abstractions require justification in the plan’s complexity section.\n+- Default to built-in or existing dependencies; new third-party libraries require explicit approval in the plan.\n+\n+## Delivery Workflow Requirements\n+- Specs define ALL functional and non-functional requirements; gaps must block implementation.\n+- Plans MUST describe architecture, data models, and technology decisions with no unresolved “TBD” items before tasks are generated.\n+- Tasks MUST trace directly to user stories or prerequisites. Each task includes file paths and checklist format.\n+- `uv run` is the required prefix for Python tooling commands.\n+\n+## Quality Gates\n+- Code review MUST verify compliance with this constitution before merge.\n+- Any violation of a MUST statement is a release blocker.\n+- Benchmarks and long-running tests may gate release but can run asynchronously if recorded before deployment.\n+\n+## Governance\n+- This constitution supersedes prior workflow documents.\n+- Amendments require explicit documentation, reviewer approval, and migration notes stored under `.specify/memory/`.\n+- Project leads are responsible for auditing adherence during planning and implementation phases.\n+\n+**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-01 | **Last Amended**: 2025-11-01\n*** End Patch"}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

Do not exceed five total questions. Skip escalation if user explicitly declines more.\n\n3. **Understand user request**: Combine `` + clarifying answers:\n   - Derive checklist theme (e.g., security, review, deploy, ux)\n   - Consolidate explicit must-have items mentioned by user\n   - Map focus selections to category scaffolding\n   - Infer any missing context from spec/plan/tasks (do NOT hallucinate)\n\n4. **Load feature context**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - spec.md: Feature requirements and scope\n   - plan.md (if exists): Technical details, dependencies\n   - tasks.md (if exists): Implementation tasks\n\n   **Context Loading Strategy**:\n   - Load only necessary portions relevant to active focus areas (avoid full-file dumping)\n   - Prefer summarizing long sections into concise scenario/requirement bullets\n   - Use progressive disclosure: add follow-on retrieval only if gaps detected\n   - If source docs are large, generate interim summary items instead of embedding raw text\n\n5. **Generate checklist** - Create \"Unit Tests for Requirements\":\n   - Create `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/` directory if it doesn't exist\n   - Generate unique checklist filename:\n     - Use short, descriptive name based on domain (e.g., `ux.md`, `api.md`, `security.md`)\n     - Format: `[domain].md`\n     - If file exists, append to existing file\n   - Number items sequentially starting from CHK001\n   - Each `/speckit.checklist` run creates a NEW file (never overwrites existing checklists)\n\n   **CORE PRINCIPLE - Test the Requirements, Not the Implementation**:\n   Every checklist item MUST evaluate the REQUIREMENTS THEMSELVES for:\n   - **Completeness**: Are all necessary requirements present?\n   - **Clarity**: Are requirements unambiguous and specific?\n   - **Consistency**: Do requirements align with each other?\n   - **Measurability**: Can requirements be objectively verified?\n   - **Coverage**: Are all scenarios/edge cases addressed?\n\n   **Category Structure** - Group items by requirement quality dimensions:\n   - **Requirement Completeness** (Are all necessary requirements documented?)\n   - **Requirement Clarity** (Are requirements specific and unambiguous?)\n   - **Requirement Consistency** (Do requirements align without conflicts?)\n   - **Acceptance Criteria Quality** (Are success criteria measurable?)\n   - **Scenario Coverage** (Are all flows/cases addressed?)\n   - **Edge Case Coverage** (Are boundary conditions defined?)\n   - **Non-Functional Requirements** (Performance, Security, Accessibility, etc. - are they specified?)\n   - **Dependencies & Assumptions** (Are they documented and validated?)\n   - **Ambiguities & Conflicts** (What needs clarification?)\n\n   **HOW TO WRITE CHECKLIST ITEMS - \"Unit Tests for English\"**:\n\n   ❌ **WRONG** (Testing implementation):\n   - \"Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards\"\n   - \"Test hover states work on desktop\"\n   - \"Confirm logo click navigates home\"\n\n   ✅ **CORRECT** (Testing requirements quality):\n   - \"Are the exact number and layout of featured episodes specified?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?\" [Clarity]\n   - \"Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?\" [Consistency]\n   - \"Are keyboard navigation requirements defined for all interactive UI?\" [Coverage]\n   - \"Is the fallback behavior specified when logo image fails to load?\" [Edge Cases]\n   - \"Are loading states defined for asynchronous episode data?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Does the spec define visual hierarchy for competing UI elements?\" [Clarity]\n\n   **ITEM STRUCTURE**:\n   Each item should follow this pattern:\n   - Question format asking about requirement quality\n   - Focus on what's WRITTEN (or not written) in the spec/plan\n   - Include quality dimension in brackets [Completeness/Clarity/Consistency/etc.]\n   - Reference spec section `[Spec §X.Y]` when checking existing requirements\n   - Use `[Gap]` marker when checking for missing requirements\n\n   **EXAMPLES BY QUALITY DIMENSION**:\n\n   Completeness:\n   - \"Are error handling requirements defined for all API failure modes? [Gap]\"\n   - \"Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Completeness]\"\n   - \"Are mobile breakpoint requirements defined for responsive layouts? [Gap]\"\n\n   Clarity:\n   - \"Is 'fast loading' quantified with specific timing thresholds? [Clarity, Spec §NFR-2]\"\n   - \"Are 'related episodes' selection criteria explicitly defined? [Clarity, Spec §FR-5]\"\n   - \"Is 'prominent' defined with measurable visual properties? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-4]\"\n\n   Consistency:\n   - \"Do navigation requirements align across all pages? [Consistency, Spec §FR-10]\"\n   - \"Are card component requirements consistent between landing and detail pages? [Consistency]\"\n\n   Coverage:\n   - \"Are requirements defined for zero-state scenarios (no episodes)? [Coverage, Edge Case]\"\n   - \"Are concurrent user interaction scenarios addressed? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n   - \"Are requirements specified for partial data loading failures? [Coverage, Exception Flow]\"\n\n   Measurability:\n   - \"Are visual hierarchy requirements measurable/testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §FR-1]\"\n   - \"Can 'balanced visual weight' be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §FR-2]\"\n\n   **Scenario Classification & Coverage** (Requirements Quality Focus):\n   - Check if requirements exist for: Primary, Alternate, Exception/Error, Recovery, Non-Functional scenarios\n   - For each scenario class, ask: \"Are [scenario type] requirements complete, clear, and consistent?\"\n   - If scenario class missing: \"Are [scenario type] requirements intentionally excluded or missing? [Gap]\"\n   - Include resilience/rollback when state mutation occurs: \"Are rollback requirements defined for migration failures? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Traceability Requirements**:\n   - MINIMUM: ≥80% of items MUST include at least one traceability reference\n   - Each item should reference: spec section `[Spec §X.Y]`, or use markers: `[Gap]`, `[Ambiguity]`, `[Conflict]`, `[Assumption]`\n   - If no ID system exists: \"Is a requirement & acceptance criteria ID scheme established? [Traceability]\"\n\n   **Surface & Resolve Issues** (Requirements Quality Problems):\n   Ask questions about the requirements themselves:\n   - Ambiguities: \"Is the term 'fast' quantified with specific metrics? [Ambiguity, Spec §NFR-1]\"\n   - Conflicts: \"Do navigation requirements conflict between §FR-10 and §FR-10a? [Conflict]\"\n   - Assumptions: \"Is the assumption of 'always available podcast API' validated? [Assumption]\"\n   - Dependencies: \"Are external podcast API requirements documented? [Dependency, Gap]\"\n   - Missing definitions: \"Is 'visual hierarchy' defined with measurable criteria? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Content Consolidation**:\n   - Soft cap: If raw candidate items > 40, prioritize by risk/impact\n   - Merge near-duplicates checking the same requirement aspect\n   - If >5 low-impact edge cases, create one item: \"Are edge cases X, Y, Z addressed in requirements? [Coverage]\"\n\n   **🚫 ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED** - These make it an implementation test, not a requirements test:\n   - ❌ Any item starting with \"Verify\", \"Test\", \"Confirm\", \"Check\" + implementation behavior\n   - ❌ References to code execution, user actions, system behavior\n   - ❌ \"Displays correctly\", \"works properly\", \"functions as expected\"\n   - ❌ \"Click\", \"navigate\", \"render\", \"load\", \"execute\"\n   - ❌ Test cases, test plans, QA procedures\n   - ❌ Implementation details (frameworks, APIs, algorithms)\n\n   **✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS** - These test requirements quality:\n   - ✅ \"Are [requirement type] defined/specified/documented for [scenario]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Is [vague term] quantified/clarified with specific criteria?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are requirements consistent between [section A] and [section B]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Can [requirement] be objectively measured/verified?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are [edge cases/scenarios] addressed in requirements?\"\n   - ✅ \"Does the spec define [missing aspect]?\"\n\n6. **Structure Reference**: Generate the checklist following the canonical template in `.specify/templates/checklist-template.md` for title, meta section, category headings, and ID formatting. If template is unavailable, use: H1 title, purpose/created meta lines, `##` category sections containing `- [ ] CHK### <requirement item>` lines with globally incrementing IDs starting at CHK001.\n\n7. **Report**: Output full path to created checklist, item count, and remind user that each run creates a new file. Summarize:\n   - Focus areas selected\n   - Depth level\n   - Actor/timing\n   - Any explicit user-specified must-have items incorporated\n\n**Important**: Each `/speckit.checklist` command invocation creates a checklist file using short, descriptive names unless file already exists. This allows:\n\n- Multiple checklists of different types (e.g., `ux.md`, `test.md`, `security.md`)\n- Simple, memorable filenames that indicate checklist purpose\n- Easy identification and navigation in the `checklists/` folder\n\nTo avoid clutter, use descriptive types and clean up obsolete checklists when done.\n\n## Example Checklist Types & Sample Items\n\n**UX Requirements Quality:** `ux.md`\n\nSample items (testing the requirements, NOT the implementation):\n\n- \"Are visual hierarchy requirements defined with measurable criteria? [Clarity, Spec §FR-1]\"\n- \"Is the number and positioning of UI elements explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-1]\"\n- \"Are interaction state requirements (hover, focus, active) consistently defined? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n- \"Is fallback behavior defined when images fail to load? [Edge Case, Gap]\"\n- \"Can 'prominent display' be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-4]\"\n\n**API Requirements Quality:** `api.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are error response formats specified for all failure scenarios? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Are rate limiting requirements quantified with specific thresholds? [Clarity]\"\n- \"Are authentication requirements consistent across all endpoints? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are retry/timeout requirements defined for external dependencies? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n- \"Is versioning strategy documented in requirements? [Gap]\"\n\n**Performance Requirements Quality:** `performance.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are performance requirements quantified with specific metrics? [Clarity]\"\n- \"Are performance targets defined for all critical user journeys? [Coverage]\"\n- \"Are performance requirements under different load conditions specified? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Can performance requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability]\"\n- \"Are degradation requirements defined for high-load scenarios? [Edge Case, Gap]\"\n\n**Security Requirements Quality:** `security.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are authentication requirements specified for all protected resources? [Coverage]\"\n- \"Are data protection requirements defined for sensitive information? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Is the threat model documented and requirements aligned to it? [Traceability]\"\n- \"Are security requirements consistent with compliance obligations? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are security failure/breach response requirements defined? [Gap, Exception Flow]\"\n\n## Anti-Examples: What NOT To Do\n\n**❌ WRONG - These test implementation, not requirements:**\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] CHK001 - Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards [Spec §FR-001]\n- [ ] CHK002 - Test hover states work correctly on desktop [Spec §FR-003]\n- [ ] CHK003 - Confirm logo click navigates to home page [Spec §FR-010]\n- [ ] CHK004 - Check that related episodes section shows 3-5 items [Spec §FR-005]\n```\n\n**✅ CORRECT - These test requirements quality:**\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] CHK001 - Are the number and layout of featured episodes explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]\n- [ ] CHK002 - Are hover state requirements consistently defined for all interactive elements? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003]\n- [ ] CHK003 - Are navigation requirements clear for all clickable brand elements? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]\n- [ ] CHK004 - Is the selection criteria for related episodes documented? [Gap, Spec §FR-005]\n- [ ] CHK005 - Are loading state requirements defined for asynchronous episode data? [Gap]\n- [ ] CHK006 - Can \"visual hierarchy\" requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-001]\n```\n\n**Key Differences:**\n\n- Wrong: Tests if the system works correctly\n- Correct: Tests if the requirements are written correctly\n- Wrong: Verification of behavior\n- Correct: Validation of requirement quality\n- Wrong: \"Does it do X?\"\n- Correct: \"Is X clearly specified?\"\n"}]}}

Skip escalation if user explicitly declines more.\n\n3. **Understand user request**: Combine `` + clarifying answers:\n   - Derive checklist theme (e.g., security, review, deploy, ux)\n   - Consolidate explicit must-have items mentioned by user\n   - Map focus selections to category scaffolding\n   - Infer any missing context from spec/plan/tasks (do NOT hallucinate)\n\n4. **Load feature context**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - spec.md: Feature requirements and scope\n   - plan.md (if exists): Technical details, dependencies\n   - tasks.md (if exists): Implementation tasks\n\n   **Context Loading Strategy**:\n   - Load only necessary portions relevant to active focus areas (avoid full-file dumping)\n   - Prefer summarizing long sections into concise scenario/requirement bullets\n   - Use progressive disclosure: add follow-on retrieval only if gaps detected\n   - If source docs are large, generate interim summary items instead of embedding raw text\n\n5. **Generate checklist** - Create \"Unit Tests for Requirements\":\n   - Create `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/` directory if it doesn't exist\n   - Generate unique checklist filename:\n     - Use short, descriptive name based on domain (e.g., `ux.md`, `api.md`, `security.md`)\n     - Format: `[domain].md`\n     - If file exists, append to existing file\n   - Number items sequentially starting from CHK001\n   - Each `/speckit.checklist` run creates a NEW file (never overwrites existing checklists)\n\n   **CORE PRINCIPLE - Test the Requirements, Not the Implementation**:\n   Every checklist item MUST evaluate the REQUIREMENTS THEMSELVES for:\n   - **Completeness**: Are all necessary requirements present?\n   - **Clarity**: Are requirements unambiguous and specific?\n   - **Consistency**: Do requirements align with each other?\n   - **Measurability**: Can requirements be objectively verified?\n   - **Coverage**: Are all scenarios/edge cases addressed?\n\n   **Category Structure** - Group items by requirement quality dimensions:\n   - **Requirement Completeness** (Are all necessary requirements documented?)\n   - **Requirement Clarity** (Are requirements specific and unambiguous?)\n   - **Requirement Consistency** (Do requirements align without conflicts?)\n   - **Acceptance Criteria Quality** (Are success criteria measurable?)\n   - **Scenario Coverage** (Are all flows/cases addressed?)\n   - **Edge Case Coverage** (Are boundary conditions defined?)\n   - **Non-Functional Requirements** (Performance, Security, Accessibility, etc. - are they specified?)\n   - **Dependencies & Assumptions** (Are they documented and validated?)\n   - **Ambiguities & Conflicts** (What needs clarification?)\n\n   **HOW TO WRITE CHECKLIST ITEMS - \"Unit Tests for English\"**:\n\n   ❌ **WRONG** (Testing implementation):\n   - \"Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards\"\n   - \"Test hover states work on desktop\"\n   - \"Confirm logo click navigates home\"\n\n   ✅ **CORRECT** (Testing requirements quality):\n   - \"Are the exact number and layout of featured episodes specified?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?\" [Clarity]\n   - \"Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?\" [Consistency]\n   - \"Are keyboard navigation requirements defined for all interactive UI?\" [Coverage]\n   - \"Is the fallback behavior specified when logo image fails to load?\" [Edge Cases]\n   - \"Are loading states defined for asynchronous episode data?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Does the spec define visual hierarchy for competing UI elements?\" [Clarity]\n\n   **ITEM STRUCTURE**:\n   Each item should follow this pattern:\n   - Question format asking about requirement quality\n   - Focus on what's WRITTEN (or not written) in the spec/plan\n   - Include quality dimension in brackets [Completeness/Clarity/Consistency/etc.]\n   - Reference spec section `[Spec §X.Y]` when checking existing requirements\n   - Use `[Gap]` marker when checking for missing requirements\n\n   **EXAMPLES BY QUALITY DIMENSION**:\n\n   Completeness:\n   - \"Are error handling requirements defined for all API failure modes? [Gap]\"\n   - \"Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Completeness]\"\n   - \"Are mobile breakpoint requirements defined for responsive layouts? [Gap]\"\n\n   Clarity:\n   - \"Is 'fast loading' quantified with specific timing thresholds? [Clarity, Spec §NFR-2]\"\n   - \"Are 'related episodes' selection criteria explicitly defined? [Clarity, Spec §FR-5]\"\n   - \"Is 'prominent' defined with measurable visual properties? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-4]\"\n\n   Consistency:\n   - \"Do navigation requirements align across all pages? [Consistency, Spec §FR-10]\"\n   - \"Are card component requirements consistent between landing and detail pages? [Consistency]\"\n\n   Coverage:\n   - \"Are requirements defined for zero-state scenarios (no episodes)? [Coverage, Edge Case]\"\n   - \"Are concurrent user interaction scenarios addressed? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n   - \"Are requirements specified for partial data loading failures? [Coverage, Exception Flow]\"\n\n   Measurability:\n   - \"Are visual hierarchy requirements measurable/testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §FR-1]\"\n   - \"Can 'balanced visual weight' be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §FR-2]\"\n\n   **Scenario Classification & Coverage** (Requirements Quality Focus):\n   - Check if requirements exist for: Primary, Alternate, Exception/Error, Recovery, Non-Functional scenarios\n   - For each scenario class, ask: \"Are [scenario type] requirements complete, clear, and consistent?\"\n   - If scenario class missing: \"Are [scenario type] requirements intentionally excluded or missing? [Gap]\"\n   - Include resilience/rollback when state mutation occurs: \"Are rollback requirements defined for migration failures? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Traceability Requirements**:\n   - MINIMUM: ≥80% of items MUST include at least one traceability reference\n   - Each item should reference: spec section `[Spec §X.Y]`, or use markers: `[Gap]`, `[Ambiguity]`, `[Conflict]`, `[Assumption]`\n   - If no ID system exists: \"Is a requirement & acceptance criteria ID scheme established? [Traceability]\"\n\n   **Surface & Resolve Issues** (Requirements Quality Problems):\n   Ask questions about the requirements themselves:\n   - Ambiguities: \"Is the term 'fast' quantified with specific metrics? [Ambiguity, Spec §NFR-1]\"\n   - Conflicts: \"Do navigation requirements conflict between §FR-10 and §FR-10a? [Conflict]\"\n   - Assumptions: \"Is the assumption of 'always available podcast API' validated? [Assumption]\"\n   - Dependencies: \"Are external podcast API requirements documented? [Dependency, Gap]\"\n   - Missing definitions: \"Is 'visual hierarchy' defined with measurable criteria? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Content Consolidation**:\n   - Soft cap: If raw candidate items > 40, prioritize by risk/impact\n   - Merge near-duplicates checking the same requirement aspect\n   - If >5 low-impact edge cases, create one item: \"Are edge cases X, Y, Z addressed in requirements? [Coverage]\"\n\n   **🚫 ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED** - These make it an implementation test, not a requirements test:\n   - ❌ Any item starting with \"Verify\", \"Test\", \"Confirm\", \"Check\" + implementation behavior\n   - ❌ References to code execution, user actions, system behavior\n   - ❌ \"Displays correctly\", \"works properly\", \"functions as expected\"\n   - ❌ \"Click\", \"navigate\", \"render\", \"load\", \"execute\"\n   - ❌ Test cases, test plans, QA procedures\n   - ❌ Implementation details (frameworks, APIs, algorithms)\n\n   **✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS** - These test requirements quality:\n   - ✅ \"Are [requirement type] defined/specified/documented for [scenario]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Is [vague term] quantified/clarified with specific criteria?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are requirements consistent between [section A] and [section B]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Can [requirement] be objectively measured/verified?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are [edge cases/scenarios] addressed in requirements?\"\n   - ✅ \"Does the spec define [missing aspect]?\"\n\n6. **Structure Reference**: Generate the checklist following the canonical template in `.specify/templates/checklist-template.md` for title, meta section, category headings, and ID formatting. If template is unavailable, use: H1 title, purpose/created meta lines, `##` category sections containing `- [ ] CHK### <requirement item>` lines with globally incrementing IDs starting at CHK001.\n\n7. **Report**: Output full path to created checklist, item count, and remind user that each run creates a new file. Summarize:\n   - Focus areas selected\n   - Depth level\n   - Actor/timing\n   - Any explicit user-specified must-have items incorporated\n\n**Important**: Each `/speckit.checklist` command invocation creates a checklist file using short, descriptive names unless file already exists. This allows:\n\n- Multiple checklists of different types (e.g., `ux.md`, `test.md`, `security.md`)\n- Simple, memorable filenames that indicate checklist purpose\n- Easy identification and navigation in the `checklists/` folder\n\nTo avoid clutter, use descriptive types and clean up obsolete checklists when done.\n\n## Example Checklist Types & Sample Items\n\n**UX Requirements Quality:** `ux.md`\n\nSample items (testing the requirements, NOT the implementation):\n\n- \"Are visual hierarchy requirements defined with measurable criteria? [Clarity, Spec §FR-1]\"\n- \"Is the number and positioning of UI elements explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-1]\"\n- \"Are interaction state requirements (hover, focus, active) consistently defined? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n- \"Is fallback behavior defined when images fail to load? [Edge Case, Gap]\"\n- \"Can 'prominent display' be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-4]\"\n\n**API Requirements Quality:** `api.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are error response formats specified for all failure scenarios? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Are rate limiting requirements quantified with specific thresholds? [Clarity]\"\n- \"Are authentication requirements consistent across all endpoints? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are retry/timeout requirements defined for external dependencies? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n- \"Is versioning strategy documented in requirements? [Gap]\"\n\n**Performance Requirements Quality:** `performance.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are performance requirements quantified with specific metrics? [Clarity]\"\n- \"Are performance targets defined for all critical user journeys? [Coverage]\"\n- \"Are performance requirements under different load conditions specified? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Can performance requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability]\"\n- \"Are degradation requirements defined for high-load scenarios? [Edge Case, Gap]\"\n\n**Security Requirements Quality:** `security.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are authentication requirements specified for all protected resources? [Coverage]\"\n- \"Are data protection requirements defined for sensitive information? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Is the threat model documented and requirements aligned to it? [Traceability]\"\n- \"Are security requirements consistent with compliance obligations? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are security failure/breach response requirements defined? [Gap, Exception Flow]\"\n\n## Anti-Examples: What NOT To Do\n\n**❌ WRONG - These test implementation, not requirements:**\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] CHK001 - Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards [Spec §FR-001]\n- [ ] CHK002 - Test hover states work correctly on desktop [Spec §FR-003]\n- [ ] CHK003 - Confirm logo click navigates to home page [Spec §FR-010]\n- [ ] CHK004 - Check that related episodes section shows 3-5 items [Spec §FR-005]\n```\n\n**✅ CORRECT - These test requirements quality:**\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] CHK001 - Are the number and layout of featured episodes explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]\n- [ ] CHK002 - Are hover state requirements consistently defined for all interactive elements? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003]\n- [ ] CHK003 - Are navigation requirements clear for all clickable brand elements? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]\n- [ ] CHK004 - Is the selection criteria for related episodes documented? [Gap, Spec §FR-005]\n- [ ] CHK005 - Are loading state requirements defined for asynchronous episode data? [Gap]\n- [ ] CHK006 - Can \"visual hierarchy\" requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-001]\n```\n\n**Key Differences:**\n\n- Wrong: Tests if the system works correctly\n- Correct: Tests if the requirements are written correctly\n- Wrong: Verification of behavior\n- Correct: Validation of requirement quality\n- Wrong: \"Does it do X?\"\n- Correct: \"Is X clearly specified?\"\n","images":[]}}

[Completeness, Spec §US1; Spec §FR-006; Contracts/log-entry.schema.json]\n+- [ ] CHK002 Are configuration requirements covering console, file, syslog, and HTTP handlers including enable/disable flags, endpoints, credentials, and formatting options? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004; Spec §FR-005; Spec §Dependencies]\n+- [ ] CHK003 Are contextual logging requirements documenting mandatory metadata (request ID, proxy URL, strategy, health status) for each emitting subsystem? [Completeness, Spec §US4; Spec §FR-007; Spec §FR-016]\n+- [ ] CHK004 Are filtering and sampling capabilities fully defined with scope, configuration mechanisms, and operator controls? [Completeness, Spec §FR-018; Spec §FR-019]\n+- [ ] CHK005 Are runtime configuration reload rules explicit about precedence between environment variables and config files? [Completeness, Gap, Spec §FR-003]\n+\n+## Requirement Clarity\n+\n+- [ ] CHK006 Is the structured log schema clear about required vs optional fields, data types, and encoding rules across formats? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001; Contracts/log-entry.schema.json]\n+- [ ] CHK007 Are rotation and retention triggers quantified with precise units (size, time, count) for both size- and time-based policies? [Clarity, Spec §US5; Spec §FR-009; Spec §FR-010; Spec §FR-011]\n+- [ ] CHK008 Is the expected behavior of log sampling (drop policy, reporting) expressed with measurable thresholds or ratios? [Clarity, Gap, Spec §FR-019]\n+- [ ] CHK009 Are redaction rules precise about which fields are masked and the acceptable replacement format? [Clarity, Spec §FR-017; Plan §Technical Context]\n+- [ ] CHK010 Are performance targets tied to defined environments and workloads so measurements are unambiguous? [Clarity, Spec §SC-003; Spec §SC-005; Plan §Performance Goals]\n+\n+## Requirement Consistency\n+\n+- [ ] CHK011 Do runtime reload requirements align between user stories and success criteria (e.g., <1s effect, handler stability)? [Consistency, Spec §US2; Spec §SC-002]\n+- [ ] CHK012 Are fallback expectations (stderr, warnings) consistent between remote handler scenarios and documented edge cases? [Consistency, Spec §US3; Spec §Edge Cases]\n+- [ ] CHK013 Do contextual metadata requirements stay consistent with health monitoring outputs to avoid conflicting field semantics? [Consistency, Spec §US4; Spec §FR-016; Spec §Dependencies]\n+- [ ] CHK014 Are drop-counter requirements aligned with bounded queue behavior so dropped counts map to sampling/overflow policies? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases; Spec §FR-021]\n+\n+## Acceptance Criteria Quality\n+\n+- [ ] CHK015 Can structured output acceptance scenarios be verified objectively through schema validation for all supported formats? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §US1; Spec §SC-001]\n+- [ ] CHK016 Do runtime level-change scenarios define measurable outcomes for both increasing and decreasing verbosity? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §US2; Spec §SC-002]\n+- [ ] CHK017 Are performance acceptance criteria linked to repeatable benchmark setups (data volume, concurrency, duration)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-003; Spec §SC-005; Plan §Testing]\n+\n+## Scenario Coverage\n+\n+- [ ] CHK018 Are requirements covering cases where no handlers are configured or all handlers fail initialization? [Coverage, Gap]\n+- [ ] CHK019 Are concurrent configuration reload scenarios during sustained high-volume logging addressed? [Coverage, Gap, Spec §SC-002; Spec §SC-005]\n+- [ ] CHK020 Are recovery behaviors specified for resuming normal logging after remote destination outages? [Coverage, Spec §US3; Spec §Edge Cases]\n+\n+## Edge Case Coverage\n+\n+- [ ] CHK021 Are serialization failure fallbacks documented for unhandled data types or circular references? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]\n+- [ ] CHK022 Are disk-full or permission-denied file system scenarios covered for rotation and retention? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases; Spec §FR-013]\n+- [ ] CHK023 Are crash or signal handler logging requirements detailed for synchronous fallback paths? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]\n+\n+## Non-Functional Requirements\n+\n+- [ ] CHK024 Are security and privacy requirements ensuring zero credential leakage fully specified with measurable expectations? [Non-Functional, Spec §FR-017; Spec §SC-007]\n+- [ ] CHK025 Are observability metrics (drop counters, queue size, handler errors) defined with reporting cadence and interfaces? [Non-Functional, Spec §FR-021; Spec §Dependencies]\n+- [ ] CHK026 Are availability and resiliency expectations (24/7 operation, rotation cleanup within target windows) measurable? [Non-Functional, Plan §Scale/Scope; Spec §SC-008; Spec §SC-010]\n+\n+## Dependencies & Assumptions\n+\n+- [ ] CHK027 Are integration expectations with Configuration Management (Feature 012) documented, including shared schema alignment? [Dependency, Spec §Dependencies; Plan §Summary]\n+- [ ] CHK028 Are assumptions about environment-variable availability validated or justified for deployment environments? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]\n+- [ ] CHK029 Is the boundary with Health Monitoring (Feature 006) defined so each team knows ownership of health-context fields? [Dependency, Spec §Dependencies; Spec §FR-016]\n+\n+## Ambiguities & Conflicts\n+\n+- [ ] CHK030 Is the “Draft” status resolved with approval criteria so requirements are considered authoritative? [Ambiguity, Spec Header]\n+- [ ] CHK031 Are qualitative terms such as “graceful degradation” and “bounded queue” defined to prevent conflicting interpretations?
