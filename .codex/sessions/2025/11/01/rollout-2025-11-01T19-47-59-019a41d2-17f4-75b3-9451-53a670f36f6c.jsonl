That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]}}

That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[]}}

Monitor Proxy Health Trends (Priority: P1)\n+\n+Operations leads need a consolidated view of proxy pool performance to spot degradations before they impact customers.\n+\n+**Why this priority**: Without near-real-time visibility, degraded proxies cause failed requests and revenue loss.\n+\n+**Independent Test**: Review the dashboard with live traffic and confirm an operator can identify failing proxies and quantify impact without additional tooling.\n+\n+**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n+\n+1. **Given** live proxy traffic is flowing, **When** an operator opens the metrics dashboard, **Then** they see aggregated success rate, error rate, and latency by proxy pool for the selected time range.\n+2. **Given** a proxy’s failure rate spikes above its historical baseline, **When** the operator adjusts filters to that proxy, **Then** the dashboard highlights the anomaly and shows supporting trend data.\n \n ---\n \n-### User Story 2 -

Receive Automated Degradation Alerts (Priority: P2)\n+\n+Site Reliability Engineers need proactive notifications when proxy performance crosses critical thresholds so they can respond quickly.\n+\n+**Why this priority**: Alerts shorten the time to detect service issues, directly improving uptime commitments.\n+\n+**Independent Test**: Simulate a threshold breach and verify the alert is delivered with actionable context to the on-call channel.\n+\n+**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n+\n+1. **Given** alert thresholds are defined for error rate and latency, **When** live metrics exceed a configured limit, **Then** the system sends a notification containing severity, affected scope, and recommended next steps.\n \n ---\n \n-### User Story 3 -

Analyze Historical Performance (Priority: P3)\n+\n+Product managers and analysts need exportable historical metrics to evaluate proxy strategy effectiveness and plan capacity.\n+\n+**Why this priority**: Historical analysis informs procurement decisions and prioritizes infrastructure investments.\n+\n+**Independent Test**: Pull a 90-day report and confirm trends, seasonality, and outliers are accessible without engineering assistance.\n+\n+**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n+\n+1. **Given** archived metrics exist for the past quarter, **When** an analyst exports a time-bounded report, **Then** the file includes aggregated performance statistics with contextual annotations for major incidents.\n \n ---\n \n-[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]\n-\n ### Edge Cases\n \n-<!--\n-  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.\n-  Fill them out with the right edge cases.\n--->\n-\n-- What happens when [boundary condition]?\n-- How does system handle [error scenario]?\n+- Metrics ingestion is delayed or incomplete; the dashboard must indicate stale data and alerting should avoid duplicate escalation.\n+- A proxy pool has zero traffic within the selected window; the system should display a clear “no data” state rather than zeros.\n+- Simultaneous threshold breaches occur across multiple pools; alert deduplication must ensure on-call personnel are not overwhelmed.\n+- Export requests cover very large time spans; users should receive guidance or batching to prevent timeouts and partial files.\n \n ## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n \n-<!--\n-  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.\n-  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.\n--->\n-\n ### Functional Requirements\n \n-- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., \"allow users to create accounts\"]\n-- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., \"validate email addresses\"]  \n-- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., \"reset their password\"]\n-- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., \"persist user preferences\"]\n-- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., \"log all security events\"]\n-\n-*Example of marking unclear requirements:*\n-\n-- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified -
