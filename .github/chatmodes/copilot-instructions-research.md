## Official GitHub Copilot Instructions Specification

### Primary Instruction Files

GitHub Copilot supports three main approaches for custom instructions, with specific hierarchical precedence:

#### 1. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (Global Repository Instructions)
**Purpose**: Single-file approach for repository-wide coding guidelines
**Scope**: Applies to all files and chat requests within the repository
**Precedence**: Medium (overridden by file-specific instructions)

```markdown
# ProxyWhirl Coding Standards

## Python Development Guidelines
- Use Python 3.13+ with type hints for all functions and methods
- Follow Pydantic v2+ patterns for data validation and serialization
- Implement async/await patterns for I/O operations using httpx and asyncio
- Use loguru for structured logging with JSON formatting

## Architecture Patterns
- Implement plugin-based loader architecture following BaseLoader abstract class
- Use dependency injection patterns for cache backends (Memory, JSON, SQLite)
- Follow SOLID principles with clear separation of concerns
- Implement proper error handling with detailed error messages and logging

## Testing Standards
- Write comprehensive async tests using pytest-asyncio
- Achieve 90%+ code coverage with meaningful test scenarios
- Use fixture patterns for test data and mock external dependencies
- Implement integration tests for real-world proxy validation scenarios

## Documentation Requirements
- Include comprehensive docstrings following Google/NumPy style
- Maintain up-to-date API documentation with code examples
- Document all configuration options and their effects
- Provide troubleshooting guides for common issues
```

#### 2. `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` (File-Specific Instructions)
**Purpose**: Targeted instructions with `applyTo` frontmatter for specific file patterns
**Scope**: Applied automatically based on glob patterns or manually referenced
**Precedence**: High (most specific, overrides global instructions)

**Example: Python/FastAPI Specific Instructions**
```markdown
---
applyTo: "**/*.py"
description: "Python development guidelines for ProxyWhirl codebase"
---

# Python Development Standards for ProxyWhirl

## Type Safety & Validation
- Always use strict type hints with `from __future__ import annotations`
- Implement Pydantic models for all data structures with proper validation
- Use `typing.Annotated` for complex type constraints
- Leverage `mypy --strict` compliance for all code

## Async Patterns
- Use `httpx.AsyncClient` for HTTP requests with proper connection pooling
- Implement proper async context managers for resource management
- Use `asyncio.gather()` for concurrent operations where appropriate
- Handle async exceptions with proper error propagation

## Performance Optimization
- Use `model_validate_json()` for 2x faster Pydantic validation
- Implement connection pooling for database and HTTP operations
- Use lazy loading patterns for expensive operations
- Profile critical paths with `cProfile` or `py-spy`

## Code Organization
- Follow domain-driven design principles with clear module boundaries
- Implement factory patterns for plugin loader instantiation
- Use dependency injection for testability and flexibility
- Maintain clean separation between business logic and infrastructure
```

**Example: Frontend-Specific Instructions**
```markdown
---
applyTo: "docs/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,md,mdx}"
description: "Next.js 15 and React 19 development guidelines for documentation site"
---

# Next.js 15 + React 19 Development Standards

## Server Components & App Router
- Use Server Components by default, only add 'use client' when necessary
- Implement proper data fetching with `fetch()` and ISR configuration
- Use streaming patterns for improved user experience
- Optimize bundle size by minimizing client component boundaries

## TypeScript Excellence
- Enable strict mode with proper type safety
- Use proper Next.js types for pages, layouts, and components
- Implement proper error boundaries with TypeScript support
- Use discriminated unions for component prop variants

## Performance Optimization
- Implement proper image optimization with next/image
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting where appropriate
- Optimize Core Web Vitals metrics
- Implement proper caching strategies for static and dynamic content

## Documentation Standards
- Use MDX for rich documentation content
- Implement proper syntax highlighting for code examples
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Follow accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1 AA)
```

#### 3. Personal Instructions (User Profile Level)
**Purpose**: User-specific preferences that apply across all repositories
**Scope**: Global across all GitHub Copilot interactions for the user
**Precedence**: Lowest (applied first, can be overridden by repository instructions)

### Instruction Hierarchical Precedence

```
1. Personal/User Instructions (lowest precedence)
   ↓
2. Repository .github/copilot-instructions.md (medium precedence)
   ↓
3. File-specific .github/instructions/*.instructions.md (highest precedence)
   ↓
4. Manually attached instructions in chat (override all)
```

    { "text": "Always check for security vulnerabilities and performance implications" }
  ],
  "github.copilot.chat.commitMessageGeneration.instructions": [
    { "text": "Use conventional commit format with scope: type(scope): description" },
    { "text": "Include ticket reference when available" }
  ],
  "github.copilot.chat.pullRequestDescriptionGeneration.instructions": [
    { "file": ".github/instructions/pr-template.instructions.md" }
  ]
}
```

#### Instruction File Auto-Discovery
VS Code automatically discovers instruction files in configured locations:

```json
{
  "chat.instructionsFilesLocations": {
    ".github/instructions": true,
    "docs/copilot-guidance": true,
    "src/ai-instructions": false
  }
}
```

#### Prompt Files Integration (Experimental)
VS Code 2025 introduces prompt files (`.prompt.md`) for reusable chat prompts:

```json
{
  "chat.promptFiles": true,
  "chat.promptFilesLocations": {
    ".github/prompts": true,
    "tools/prompts": true

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_proxy_validation_success(mock_httpx_client):
    """Test successful proxy validation with mocked HTTP client."""
    proxy = Proxy(ip="127.0.0.1", port=8080, scheme=ProxyScheme.HTTP)
    validator = ProxyValidator()
    
    result = await validator.validate_proxy(proxy)
    
    assert result.is_valid
    assert result.response_time < 5.0
    assert result.anonymity_level is not None
```

## Mock Patterns
