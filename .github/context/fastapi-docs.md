# HTTP Basic Auth

For the simplest cases, you can use HTTP Basic Auth.

In HTTP Basic Auth, the application expects a header that contains a username and a password.

If it doesn't receive it, it returns an HTTP 401 "Unauthorized" error.

And returns a header `WWW-Authenticate` with a value of `Basic`, and an optional `realm` parameter.

That tells the browser to show the integrated prompt for a username and password.

Then, when you type that username and password, the browser sends them in the header automatically.

## Simple HTTP Basic Auth

* Import `HTTPBasic` and `HTTPBasicCredentials`.
* Create a "`security` scheme" using `HTTPBasic`.
* Use that `security` with a dependency in your *path operation*.
* It returns an object of type `HTTPBasicCredentials`:
    * It contains the `username` and `password` sent.

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial006_an_py39.py hl[4,8,12] *}

When you try to open the URL for the first time (or click the "Execute" button in the docs) the browser will ask you for your username and password:

<img src="/img/tutorial/security/image12.png">

## Check the username

Here's a more complete example.

Use a dependency to check if the username and password are correct.

For this, use the Python standard module <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html" class="external-link" target="_blank">`secrets`</a> to check the username and password.

`secrets.compare_digest()` needs to take `bytes` or a `str` that only contains ASCII characters (the ones in English), this means it wouldn't work with characters like `á`, as in `Sebastián`.

To handle that, we first convert the `username` and `password` to `bytes` encoding them with UTF-8.

Then we can use `secrets.compare_digest()` to ensure that `credentials.username` is `"stanleyjobson"`, and that `credentials.password` is `"swordfish"`.

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial007_an_py39.py hl[1,12:24] *}

This would be similar to:

```Python
if not (credentials.username == "stanleyjobson") or not (credentials.password == "swordfish"):
    # Return some error
    ...
```

But by using the `secrets.compare_digest()` it will be secure against a type of attacks called "timing attacks".

### Timing Attacks

But what's a "timing attack"?

Let's imagine some attackers are trying to guess the username and password.

And they send a request with a username `johndoe` and a password `love123`.

Then the Python code in your application would be equivalent to something like:

```Python
if "johndoe" == "stanleyjobson" and "love123" == "swordfish":
    ...
```

But right at the moment Python compares the first `j` in `johndoe` to the first `s` in `stanleyjobson`, it will return `False`, because it already knows that those two strings are not the same, thinking that "there's no need to waste more computation comparing the rest of the letters". And your application will say "Incorrect username or password".

But then the attackers try with username `stanleyjobsox` and password `love123`.

And your application code does something like:

```Python
if "stanleyjobsox" == "stanleyjobson" and "love123" == "swordfish":
    ...
```

Python will have to compare the whole `stanleyjobso` in both `stanleyjobsox` and `stanleyjobson` before realizing that both strings are not the same. So it will take some extra microseconds to reply back "Incorrect username or password".

#### The time to answer helps the attackers

At that point, by noticing that the server took some microseconds longer to send the "Incorrect username or password" response, the attackers will know that they got _something_ right, some of the initial letters were right.

And then they can try again knowing that it's probably something more similar to `stanleyjobsox` than to `johndoe`.

#### A "professional" attack

Of course, the attackers would not try all this by hand, they would write a program to do it, possibly with thousands or millions of tests per second. And they would get just one extra correct letter at a time.

But doing that, in some minutes or hours the attackers would have guessed the correct username and password, with the "help" of our application, just using the time taken to answer.

#### Fix it with `secrets.compare_digest()`

But in our code we are actually using `secrets.compare_digest()`.

In short, it will take the same time to compare `stanleyjobsox` to `stanleyjobson` than it takes to compare `johndoe` to `stanleyjobson`. And the same for the password.

That way, using `secrets.compare_digest()` in your application code, it will be safe against this whole range of security attacks.

### Return the error

After detecting that the credentials are incorrect, return an `HTTPException` with a status code 401 (the same returned when no credentials are provided) and add the header `WWW-Authenticate` to make the browser show the login prompt again:

# OAuth2 scopes

You can use OAuth2 scopes directly with **FastAPI**, they are integrated to work seamlessly.

This would allow you to have a more fine-grained permission system, following the OAuth2 standard, integrated into your OpenAPI application (and the API docs).

OAuth2 with scopes is the mechanism used by many big authentication providers, like Facebook, Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Twitter, etc. They use it to provide specific permissions to users and applications.

Every time you "log in with" Facebook, Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Twitter, that application is using OAuth2 with scopes.

In this section you will see how to manage authentication and authorization with the same OAuth2 with scopes in your **FastAPI** application.

/// warning

This is a more or less advanced section. If you are just starting, you can skip it.

You don't necessarily need OAuth2 scopes, and you can handle authentication and authorization however you want.

But OAuth2 with scopes can be nicely integrated into your API (with OpenAPI) and your API docs.

Nevertheless, you still enforce those scopes, or any other security/authorization requirement, however you need, in your code.

In many cases, OAuth2 with scopes can be an overkill.

But if you know you need it, or you are curious, keep reading.

///

## OAuth2 scopes and OpenAPI

The OAuth2 specification defines "scopes" as a list of strings separated by spaces.

The content of each of these strings can have any format, but should not contain spaces.

These scopes represent "permissions".

In OpenAPI (e.g. the API docs), you can define "security schemes".

When one of these security schemes uses OAuth2, you can also declare and use scopes.

Each "scope" is just a string (without spaces).

They are normally used to declare specific security permissions, for example:

* `users:read` or `users:write` are common examples.
* `instagram_basic` is used by Facebook / Instagram.
* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` is used by Google.

/// info

In OAuth2 a "scope" is just a string that declares a specific permission required.

It doesn't matter if it has other characters like `:` or if it is a URL.

Those details are implementation specific.

For OAuth2 they are just strings.

///

## Global view

First, let's quickly see the parts that change from the examples in the main **Tutorial - User Guide** for [OAuth2 with Password (and hashing), Bearer with JWT tokens](../../tutorial/security/oauth2-jwt.md){.internal-link target=_blank}. Now using OAuth2 scopes:

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial005_an_py310.py hl[5,9,13,47,65,106,108:116,122:125,129:135,140,156] *}

Now let's review those changes step by step.

## OAuth2 Security scheme

The first change is that now we are declaring the OAuth2 security scheme with two available scopes, `me` and `items`.

The `scopes` parameter receives a `dict` with each scope as a key and the description as the value:

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial005_an_py310.py hl[63:66] *}

Because we are now declaring those scopes, they will show up in the API docs when you log-in/authorize.

And you will be able to select which scopes you want to give access to: `me` and `items`.

This is the same mechanism used when you give permissions while logging in with Facebook, Google, GitHub, etc:

<img src="/img/tutorial/security/image11.png">

## JWT token with scopes

Now, modify the token *path operation* to return the scopes requested.

We are still using the same `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm`. It includes a property `scopes` with a `list` of `str`, with each scope it received in the request.

And we return the scopes as part of the JWT token.

/// danger

For simplicity, here we are just adding the scopes received directly to the token.

But in your application, for security, you should make sure you only add the scopes that the user is actually able to have, or the ones you have predefined.

///

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial005_an_py310.py hl[156] *}

## Declare scopes in *path operations* and dependencies

Now we declare that the *path operation* for `/users/me/items/` requires the scope `items`.

For this, we import and use `Security` from `fastapi`.

You can use `Security` to declare dependencies (just like `Depends`), but `Security` also receives a parameter `scopes` with a list of scopes (strings).

In this case, we pass a dependency function `get_current_active_user` to `Security` (the same way we would do with `Depends`).

But we also pass a `list` of scopes, in this case with just one scope: `items` (it could have more).

And the dependency function `get_current_active_user` can also declare sub-dependencies, not only with `Depends` but also with `Security`. Declaring its own sub-dependency function (`get_current_user`), and more scope requirements.

In this case, it requires the scope `me` (it could require more than one scope).

/// note

You don't necessarily need to add different scopes in different places.

We are doing it here to demonstrate how **FastAPI** handles scopes declared at different levels.

///

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial005_an_py310.py hl[5,140,171] *}

/// info | Technical Details

`Security` is actually a subclass of `Depends`, and it has just one extra parameter that we'll see later.

But by using `Security` instead of `Depends`, **FastAPI** will know that it can declare security scopes, use them internally, and document the API with OpenAPI.

But when you import `Query`, `Path`, `Depends`, `Security` and others from `fastapi`, those are actually functions that return special classes.

///

## Use `SecurityScopes`

Now update the dependency `get_current_user`.

This is the one used by the dependencies above.

Here's where we are using the same OAuth2 scheme we created before, declaring it as a dependency: `oauth2_scheme`.

Because this dependency function doesn't have any scope requirements itself, we can use `Depends` with `oauth2_scheme`, we don't have to use `Security` when we don't need to specify security scopes.

We also declare a special parameter of type `SecurityScopes`, imported from `fastapi.security`.

This `SecurityScopes` class is similar to `Request` (`Request` was used to get the request object directly).

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial005_an_py310.py hl[9,106] *}

## Use the `scopes`

The parameter `security_scopes` will be of type `SecurityScopes`.

It will have a property `scopes` with a list containing all the scopes required by itself and all the dependencies that use this as a sub-dependency. That means, all the "dependants"... this might sound confusing, it is explained again later below.

The `security_scopes` object (of class `SecurityScopes`) also provides a `scope_str` attribute with a single string, containing those scopes separated by spaces (we are going to use it).

We create an `HTTPException` that we can reuse (`raise`) later at several points.

In this exception, we include the scopes required (if any) as a string separated by spaces (using `scope_str`). We put that string containing the scopes in the `WWW-Authenticate` header (this is part of the spec).

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial005_an_py310.py hl[106,108:116] *}

## Verify the `username` and data shape

We verify that we get a `username`, and extract the scopes.

And then we validate that data with the Pydantic model (catching the `ValidationError` exception), and if we get an error reading the JWT token or validating the data with Pydantic, we raise the `HTTPException` we created before.

For that, we update the Pydantic model `TokenData` with a new property `scopes`.

By validating the data with Pydantic we can make sure that we have, for example, exactly a `list` of `str` with the scopes and a `str` with the `username`.

Instead of, for example, a `dict`, or something else, as it could break the application at some point later, making it a security risk.

We also verify that we have a user with that username, and if not, we raise that same exception we created before.

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial005_an_py310.py hl[47,117:128] *}

## Verify the `scopes`

We now verify that all the scopes required, by this dependency and all the dependants (including *path operations*), are included in the scopes provided in the token received, otherwise raise an `HTTPException`.

For this, we use `security_scopes.scopes`, that contains a `list` with all these scopes as `str`.

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial005_an_py310.py hl[129:135] *}

## Dependency tree and scopes

Let's review again this dependency tree and the scopes.

As the `get_current_active_user` dependency has as a sub-dependency on `get_current_user`, the scope `"me"` declared at `get_current_active_user` will be included in the list of required scopes in the `security_scopes.scopes` passed to `get_current_user`.

The *path operation* itself also declares a scope, `"items"`, so this will also be in the list of `security_scopes.scopes` passed to `get_current_user`.

Here's how the hierarchy of dependencies and scopes looks like:

* The *path operation* `read_own_items` has:
    * Required scopes `["items"]` with the dependency:
    * `get_current_active_user`:
        *  The dependency function `get_current_active_user` has:
            * Required scopes `["me"]` with the dependency:
            * `get_current_user`:
                * The dependency function `get_current_user` has:
                    * No scopes required by itself.
                    * A dependency using `oauth2_scheme`.
                    * A `security_scopes` parameter of type `SecurityScopes`:
                        * This `security_scopes` parameter has a property `scopes` with a `list` containing all these scopes declared above, so:
                            * `security_scopes.scopes` will contain `["me", "items"]` for the *path operation* `read_own_items`.
                            * `security_scopes.scopes` will contain `["me"]` for the *path operation* `read_users_me`, because it is declared in the dependency `get_current_active_user`.
                            * `security_scopes.scopes` will contain `[]` (nothing) for the *path operation* `read_system_status`, because it didn't declare any `Security` with `scopes`, and its dependency, `get_current_user`, doesn't declare any `scopes` either.

/// tip

The important and "magic" thing here is that `get_current_user` will have a different list of `scopes` to check for each *path operation*.

All depending on the `scopes` declared in each *path operation* and each dependency in the dependency tree for that specific *path operation*.

///

## More details about `SecurityScopes`

You can use `SecurityScopes` at any point, and in multiple places, it doesn't have to be at the "root" dependency.

It will always have the security scopes declared in the current `Security` dependencies and all the dependants for **that specific** *path operation* and **that specific** dependency tree.

Because the `SecurityScopes` will have all the scopes declared by dependants, you can use it to verify that a token has the required scopes in a central dependency function, and then declare different scope requirements in different *path operations*.

They will be checked independently for each *path operation*.

## Check it

If you open the API docs, you can authenticate and specify which scopes you want to authorize.

<img src="/img/tutorial/security/image11.png">

If you don't select any scope, you will be "authenticated", but when you try to access `/users/me/` or `/users/me/items/` you will get an error saying that you don't have enough permissions. You will still be able to access `/status/`.

And if you select the scope `me` but not the scope `items`, you will be able to access `/users/me/` but not `/users/me/items/`.

That's what would happen to a third party application that tried to access one of these *path operations* with a token provided by a user, depending on how many permissions the user gave the application.

## About third party integrations

In this example we are using the OAuth2 "password" flow.

This is appropriate when we are logging in to our own application, probably with our own frontend.

Because we can trust it to receive the `username` and `password`, as we control it.

But if you are building an OAuth2 application that others would connect to (i.e., if you are building an authentication provider equivalent to Facebook, Google, GitHub, etc.) you should use one of the other flows.

The most common is the implicit flow.

The most secure is the code flow, but it's more complex to implement as it requires more steps. As it is more complex, many providers end up suggesting the implicit flow.

/// note

It's common that each authentication provider names their flows in a different way, to make it part of their brand.

But in the end, they are implementing the same OAuth2 standard.

///

**FastAPI** includes utilities for all these OAuth2 authentication flows in `fastapi.security.oauth2`.

## `Security` in decorator `dependencies`

The same way you can define a `list` of `Depends` in the decorator's `dependencies` parameter (as explained in [Dependencies in path operation decorators](../../tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators.md){.internal-link target=_blank}), you could also use `Security` with `scopes` there.

## File: docs/en/docs/advanced/additional-responses.md
````markdown
# Additional Responses in OpenAPI

/// warning

This is a rather advanced topic.

If you are starting with **FastAPI**, you might not need this.

///

You can declare additional responses, with additional status codes, media types, descriptions, etc.

Those additional responses will be included in the OpenAPI schema, so they will also appear in the API docs.

But for those additional responses you have to make sure you return a `Response` like `JSONResponse` directly, with your status code and content.

## Additional Response with `model`

You can pass to your *path operation decorators* a parameter `responses`.

It receives a `dict`: the keys are status codes for each response (like `200`), and the values are other `dict`s with the information for each of them.

Each of those response `dict`s can have a key `model`, containing a Pydantic model, just like `response_model`.

**FastAPI** will take that model, generate its JSON Schema and include it in the correct place in OpenAPI.

For example, to declare another response with a status code `404` and a Pydantic model `Message`, you can write:

{* ../../docs_src/additional_responses/tutorial001.py hl[18,22] *}

/// note

Keep in mind that you have to return the `JSONResponse` directly.

///

/// info

The `model` key is not part of OpenAPI.

**FastAPI** will take the Pydantic model from there, generate the JSON Schema, and put it in the correct place.

The correct place is:

* In the key `content`, that has as value another JSON object (`dict`) that contains:
    * A key with the media type, e.g. `application/json`, that contains as value another JSON object, that contains:
        * A key `schema`, that has as the value the JSON Schema from the model, here's the correct place.
            * **FastAPI** adds a reference here to the global JSON Schemas in another place in your OpenAPI instead of including it directly. This way, other applications and clients can use those JSON Schemas directly, provide better code generation tools, etc.

///

The generated responses in the OpenAPI for this *path operation* will be:

```JSON hl_lines="3-12"

                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Additional media types for the main response

You can use this same `responses` parameter to add different media types for the same main response.

For example, you can add an additional media type of `image/png`, declaring that your *path operation* can return a JSON object (with media type `application/json`) or a PNG image:

{* ../../docs_src/additional_responses/tutorial002.py hl[19:24,28] *}

/// note

Notice that you have to return the image using a `FileResponse` directly.

///

/// info

Unless you specify a different media type explicitly in your `responses` parameter, FastAPI will assume the response has the same media type as the main response class (default `application/json`).

But if you have specified a custom response class with `None` as its media type, FastAPI will use `application/json` for any additional response that has an associated model.

///

## Combining information

You can also combine response information from multiple places, including the `response_model`, `status_code`, and `responses` parameters.

You can declare a `response_model`, using the default status code `200` (or a custom one if you need), and then declare additional information for that same response in `responses`, directly in the OpenAPI schema.

**FastAPI** will keep the additional information from `responses`, and combine it with the JSON Schema from your model.

For example, you can declare a response with a status code `404` that uses a Pydantic model and has a custom `description`.

And a response with a status code `200` that uses your `response_model`, but includes a custom `example`:

{* ../../docs_src/additional_responses/tutorial003.py hl[20:31] *}

It will all be combined and included in your OpenAPI, and shown in the API docs:

<img src="/img/tutorial/additional-responses/image01.png">

## Combine predefined responses and custom ones

You might want to have some predefined responses that apply to many *path operations*, but you want to combine them with custom responses needed by each *path operation*.

For those cases, you can use the Python technique of "unpacking" a `dict` with `**dict_to_unpack`:

```Python
old_dict = {
    "old key": "old value",
    "second old key": "second old value",
}
new_dict = {**old_dict, "new key": "new value"}
```

Here, `new_dict` will contain all the key-value pairs from `old_dict` plus the new key-value pair:

```Python
{
    "old key": "old value",
    "second old key": "second old value",
    "new key": "new value",
}
```

You can use that technique to reuse some predefined responses in your *path operations* and combine them with additional custom ones.

For example:

{* ../../docs_src/additional_responses/tutorial004.py hl[13:17,26] *}

## More information about OpenAPI responses

To see what exactly you can include in the responses, you can check these sections in the OpenAPI specification:

* <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.1.0.md#responses-object" class="external-link" target="_blank">OpenAPI Responses Object</a>, it includes the `Response Object`.
* <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.1.0.md#response-object" class="external-link" target="_blank">OpenAPI Response Object</a>, you can include anything from this directly in each response inside your `responses` parameter. Including `description`, `headers`, `content` (inside of this is that you declare different media types and JSON Schemas), and `links`.
````

## File: docs/en/docs/advanced/additional-status-codes.md
````markdown
# Additional Status Codes

By default, **FastAPI** will return the responses using a `JSONResponse`, putting the content you return from your *path operation* inside of that `JSONResponse`.

It will use the default status code or the one you set in your *path operation*.

## Additional status codes

If you want to return additional status codes apart from the main one, you can do that by returning a `Response` directly, like a `JSONResponse`, and set the additional status code directly.

For example, let's say that you want to have a *path operation* that allows to update items, and returns HTTP status codes of 200 "OK" when successful.

But you also want it to accept new items. And when the items didn't exist before, it creates them, and returns an HTTP status code of 201 "Created".

To achieve that, import `JSONResponse`, and return your content there directly, setting the `status_code` that you want:

{* ../../docs_src/additional_status_codes/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[4,25] *}

/// warning

When you return a `Response` directly, like in the example above, it will be returned directly.

It won't be serialized with a model, etc.

Make sure it has the data you want it to have, and that the values are valid JSON (if you are using `JSONResponse`).

///

/// note | Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette.responses import JSONResponse`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.responses` as `fastapi.responses` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available responses come directly from Starlette. The same with `status`.

///

## OpenAPI and API docs

If you return additional status codes and responses directly, they won't be included in the OpenAPI schema (the API docs), because FastAPI doesn't have a way to know beforehand what you are going to return.

But you can document that in your code, using: [Additional Responses](additional-responses.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

# Advanced Dependencies

## Parameterized dependencies

All the dependencies we have seen are a fixed function or class.

But there could be cases where you want to be able to set parameters on the dependency, without having to declare many different functions or classes.

Let's imagine that we want to have a dependency that checks if the query parameter `q` contains some fixed content.

But we want to be able to parameterize that fixed content.

## A "callable" instance

In Python there's a way to make an instance of a class a "callable".

Not the class itself (which is already a callable), but an instance of that class.

To do that, we declare a method `__call__`:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial011_an_py39.py hl[12] *}

In this case, this `__call__` is what **FastAPI** will use to check for additional parameters and sub-dependencies, and this is what will be called to pass a value to the parameter in your *path operation function* later.

## Parameterize the instance

And now, we can use `__init__` to declare the parameters of the instance that we can use to "parameterize" the dependency:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial011_an_py39.py hl[9] *}

In this case, **FastAPI** won't ever touch or care about `__init__`, we will use it directly in our code.

## Create an instance

We could create an instance of this class with:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial011_an_py39.py hl[18] *}

And that way we are able to "parameterize" our dependency, that now has `"bar"` inside of it, as the attribute `checker.fixed_content`.

## Use the instance as a dependency

Then, we could use this `checker` in a `Depends(checker)`, instead of `Depends(FixedContentQueryChecker)`, because the dependency is the instance, `checker`, not the class itself.

And when solving the dependency, **FastAPI** will call this `checker` like:

```Python
checker(q="somequery")
```

...and pass whatever that returns as the value of the dependency in our *path operation function* as the parameter `fixed_content_included`:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial011_an_py39.py hl[22] *}

/// tip

All this might seem contrived. And it might not be very clear how is it useful yet.

These examples are intentionally simple, but show how it all works.

In the chapters about security, there are utility functions that are implemented in this same way.

If you understood all this, you already know how those utility tools for security work underneath.

````markdown
# Async Tests

You have already seen how to test your **FastAPI** applications using the provided `TestClient`. Up to now, you have only seen how to write synchronous tests, without using `async` functions.

Being able to use asynchronous functions in your tests could be useful, for example, when you're querying your database asynchronously. Imagine you want to test sending requests to your FastAPI application and then verify that your backend successfully wrote the correct data in the database, while using an async database library.

Let's look at how we can make that work.

## pytest.mark.anyio

If we want to call asynchronous functions in our tests, our test functions have to be asynchronous. AnyIO provides a neat plugin for this, that allows us to specify that some test functions are to be called asynchronously.

## HTTPX

Even if your **FastAPI** application uses normal `def` functions instead of `async def`, it is still an `async` application underneath.

The `TestClient` does some magic inside to call the asynchronous FastAPI application in your normal `def` test functions, using standard pytest. But that magic doesn't work anymore when we're using it inside asynchronous functions. By running our tests asynchronously, we can no longer use the `TestClient` inside our test functions.

The `TestClient` is based on <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org" class="external-link" target="_blank">HTTPX</a>, and luckily, we can use it directly to test the API.

## Example

For a simple example, let's consider a file structure similar to the one described in [Bigger Applications](../tutorial/bigger-applications.md){.internal-link target=_blank} and [Testing](../tutorial/testing.md){.internal-link target=_blank}:

```
.
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   └── test_main.py
```

The file `main.py` would have:

{* ../../docs_src/async_tests/main.py *}

The file `test_main.py` would have the tests for `main.py`, it could look like this now:

{* ../../docs_src/async_tests/test_main.py *}

## Run it

You can run your tests as usual via:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pytest

---> 100%
```

</div>

## In Detail

The marker `@pytest.mark.anyio` tells pytest that this test function should be called asynchronously:

{* ../../docs_src/async_tests/test_main.py hl[7] *}

/// tip

Note that the test function is now `async def` instead of just `def` as before when using the `TestClient`.

///

Then we can create an `AsyncClient` with the app, and send async requests to it, using `await`.

{* ../../docs_src/async_tests/test_main.py hl[9:12] *}

This is the equivalent to:

```Python
response = client.get('/')
```

...that we used to make our requests with the `TestClient`.

/// tip

Note that we're using async/await with the new `AsyncClient` - the request is asynchronous.

///

/// warning

If your application relies on lifespan events, the `AsyncClient` won't trigger these events. To ensure they are triggered, use `LifespanManager` from <a href="https://github.com/florimondmanca/asgi-lifespan#usage" class="external-link" target="_blank">florimondmanca/asgi-lifespan</a>.

///

## Other Asynchronous Function Calls

As the testing function is now asynchronous, you can now also call (and `await`) other `async` functions apart from sending requests to your FastAPI application in your tests, exactly as you would call them anywhere else in your code.

/// tip

If you encounter a `RuntimeError: Task attached to a different loop` when integrating asynchronous function calls in your tests (e.g. when using <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41584243/runtimeerror-task-attached-to-a-different-loop" class="external-link" target="_blank">MongoDB's MotorClient</a>), remember to instantiate objects that need an event loop only within async functions, e.g. an `'@app.on_event("startup")` callback.

## File: docs/en/docs/advanced/behind-a-proxy.md
````markdown
# Behind a Proxy

In some situations, you might need to use a **proxy** server like Traefik or Nginx with a configuration that adds an extra path prefix that is not seen by your application.

In these cases you can use `root_path` to configure your application.

The `root_path` is a mechanism provided by the ASGI specification (that FastAPI is built on, through Starlette).

The `root_path` is used to handle these specific cases.

And it's also used internally when mounting sub-applications.

## Proxy with a stripped path prefix

Having a proxy with a stripped path prefix, in this case, means that you could declare a path at `/app` in your code, but then, you add a layer on top (the proxy) that would put your **FastAPI** application under a path like `/api/v1`.

In this case, the original path `/app` would actually be served at `/api/v1/app`.

Even though all your code is written assuming there's just `/app`.

{* ../../docs_src/behind_a_proxy/tutorial001.py hl[6] *}

And the proxy would be **"stripping"** the **path prefix** on the fly before transmitting the request to the app server (probably Uvicorn via FastAPI CLI), keeping your application convinced that it is being served at `/app`, so that you don't have to update all your code to include the prefix `/api/v1`.

Up to here, everything would work as normally.

But then, when you open the integrated docs UI (the frontend), it would expect to get the OpenAPI schema at `/openapi.json`, instead of `/api/v1/openapi.json`.

So, the frontend (that runs in the browser) would try to reach `/openapi.json` and wouldn't be able to get the OpenAPI schema.

Because we have a proxy with a path prefix of `/api/v1` for our app, the frontend needs to fetch the OpenAPI schema at `/api/v1/openapi.json`.

```mermaid
graph LR

browser("Browser")
proxy["Proxy on http://0.0.0.0:9999/api/v1/app"]
server["Server on http://127.0.0.1:8000/app"]

browser --> proxy
proxy --> server
```

/// tip

The IP `0.0.0.0` is commonly used to mean that the program listens on all the IPs available in that machine/server.

///

The docs UI would also need the OpenAPI schema to declare that this API `server` is located at `/api/v1` (behind the proxy). For example:

```JSON hl_lines="4-8"
{
    "openapi": "3.1.0",
    // More stuff here
    "servers": [
        {
            "url": "/api/v1"
        }
    ],
    "paths": {
            // More stuff here
    }
}
```

In this example, the "Proxy" could be something like **Traefik**. And the server would be something like FastAPI CLI with **Uvicorn**, running your FastAPI application.

### Providing the `root_path`

To achieve this, you can use the command line option `--root-path` like:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ fastapi run main.py --root-path /api/v1

<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

</div>

If you use Hypercorn, it also has the option `--root-path`.

/// note | Technical Details

The ASGI specification defines a `root_path` for this use case.

And the `--root-path` command line option provides that `root_path`.

///

### Checking the current `root_path`

You can get the current `root_path` used by your application for each request, it is part of the `scope` dictionary (that's part of the ASGI spec).

Here we are including it in the message just for demonstration purposes.

{* ../../docs_src/behind_a_proxy/tutorial001.py hl[8] *}

Then, if you start Uvicorn with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ fastapi run main.py --root-path /api/v1

<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

</div>

The response would be something like:

```JSON
{
    "message": "Hello World",
    "root_path": "/api/v1"
}
```

### Setting the `root_path` in the FastAPI app

Alternatively, if you don't have a way to provide a command line option like `--root-path` or equivalent, you can set the `root_path` parameter when creating your FastAPI app:

{* ../../docs_src/behind_a_proxy/tutorial002.py hl[3] *}

Passing the `root_path` to `FastAPI` would be the equivalent of passing the `--root-path` command line option to Uvicorn or Hypercorn.

### About `root_path`

Keep in mind that the server (Uvicorn) won't use that `root_path` for anything else than passing it to the app.

But if you go with your browser to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/app</a> you will see the normal response:

```JSON
{
    "message": "Hello World",
    "root_path": "/api/v1"
}
```

So, it won't expect to be accessed at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/app`.

Uvicorn will expect the proxy to access Uvicorn at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/app`, and then it would be the proxy's responsibility to add the extra `/api/v1` prefix on top.

## About proxies with a stripped path prefix

Keep in mind that a proxy with stripped path prefix is only one of the ways to configure it.

Probably in many cases the default will be that the proxy doesn't have a stripped path prefix.

In a case like that (without a stripped path prefix), the proxy would listen on something like `https://myawesomeapp.com`, and then if the browser goes to `https://myawesomeapp.com/api/v1/app` and your server (e.g. Uvicorn) listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` the proxy (without a stripped path prefix) would access Uvicorn at the same path: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/app`.

## Testing locally with Traefik

You can easily run the experiment locally with a stripped path prefix using <a href="https://docs.traefik.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Traefik</a>.

<a href="https://github.com/containous/traefik/releases" class="external-link" target="_blank">Download Traefik</a>, it's a single binary, you can extract the compressed file and run it directly from the terminal.

Then create a file `traefik.toml` with:

```TOML hl_lines="3"
[entryPoints]
  [entryPoints.http]
    address = ":9999"

[providers]
  [providers.file]
    filename = "routes.toml"
```

This tells Traefik to listen on port 9999 and to use another file `routes.toml`.

/// tip

We are using port 9999 instead of the standard HTTP port 80 so that you don't have to run it with admin (`sudo`) privileges.

///

Now create that other file `routes.toml`:

```TOML hl_lines="5  12  20"
[http]
  [http.middlewares]

    [http.middlewares.api-stripprefix.stripPrefix]
      prefixes = ["/api/v1"]

  [http.routers]

    [http.routers.app-http]
      entryPoints = ["http"]
      service = "app"
      rule = "PathPrefix(`/api/v1`)"
      middlewares = ["api-stripprefix"]

  [http.services]

    [http.services.app]
      [http.services.app.loadBalancer]
        [[http.services.app.loadBalancer.servers]]
          url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000"
```

This file configures Traefik to use the path prefix `/api/v1`.

And then Traefik will redirect its requests to your Uvicorn running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

Now start Traefik:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ ./traefik --configFile=traefik.toml

INFO[0000] Configuration loaded from file: /home/user/awesomeapi/traefik.toml
```

</div>

And now start your app, using the `--root-path` option:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ fastapi run main.py --root-path /api/v1

<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

</div>

### Check the responses

Now, if you go to the URL with the port for Uvicorn: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/app" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/app</a>, you will see the normal response:

```JSON
{
    "message": "Hello World",
    "root_path": "/api/v1"
}
```

/// tip

Notice that even though you are accessing it at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/app` it shows the `root_path` of `/api/v1`, taken from the option `--root-path`.

///

And now open the URL with the port for Traefik, including the path prefix: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:9999/api/v1/app" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:9999/api/v1/app</a>.

We get the same response:

```JSON
{
    "message": "Hello World",
    "root_path": "/api/v1"
}
```

but this time at the URL with the prefix path provided by the proxy: `/api/v1`.

Of course, the idea here is that everyone would access the app through the proxy, so the version with the path prefix `/api/v1` is the "correct" one.

And the version without the path prefix (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/app`), provided by Uvicorn directly, would be exclusively for the _proxy_ (Traefik) to access it.

That demonstrates how the Proxy (Traefik) uses the path prefix and how the server (Uvicorn) uses the `root_path` from the option `--root-path`.

### Check the docs UI

But here's the fun part. ✨

The "official" way to access the app would be through the proxy with the path prefix that we defined. So, as we would expect, if you try the docs UI served by Uvicorn directly, without the path prefix in the URL, it won't work, because it expects to be accessed through the proxy.

You can check it at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>:

<img src="/img/tutorial/behind-a-proxy/image01.png">

But if we access the docs UI at the "official" URL using the proxy with port `9999`, at `/api/v1/docs`, it works correctly! 🎉

You can check it at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:9999/api/v1/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:9999/api/v1/docs</a>:

<img src="/img/tutorial/behind-a-proxy/image02.png">

Right as we wanted it. ✔️

This is because FastAPI uses this `root_path` to create the default `server` in OpenAPI with the URL provided by `root_path`.

## Additional servers

/// warning

This is a more advanced use case. Feel free to skip it.

///

By default, **FastAPI** will create a `server` in the OpenAPI schema with the URL for the `root_path`.

But you can also provide other alternative `servers`, for example if you want *the same* docs UI to interact with both a staging and a production environment.

If you pass a custom list of `servers` and there's a `root_path` (because your API lives behind a proxy), **FastAPI** will insert a "server" with this `root_path` at the beginning of the list.

For example:

{* ../../docs_src/behind_a_proxy/tutorial003.py hl[4:7] *}

Will generate an OpenAPI schema like:

```JSON hl_lines="5-7"
{
    "openapi": "3.1.0",
    // More stuff here
    "servers": [
        {
            "url": "/api/v1"
        },
        {
            "url": "https://stag.example.com",
            "description": "Staging environment"
        },
        {
            "url": "https://prod.example.com",
            "description": "Production environment"
        }
    ],
    "paths": {
            // More stuff here
    }
}
```

/// tip

Notice the auto-generated server with a `url` value of `/api/v1`, taken from the `root_path`.

///

In the docs UI at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:9999/api/v1/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:9999/api/v1/docs</a> it would look like:

<img src="/img/tutorial/behind-a-proxy/image03.png">

/// tip

The docs UI will interact with the server that you select.

///

### Disable automatic server from `root_path`

If you don't want **FastAPI** to include an automatic server using the `root_path`, you can use the parameter `root_path_in_servers=False`:

{* ../../docs_src/behind_a_proxy/tutorial004.py hl[9] *}

and then it won't include it in the OpenAPI schema.

## Mounting a sub-application

If you need to mount a sub-application (as described in [Sub Applications - Mounts](sub-applications.md){.internal-link target=_blank}) while also using a proxy with `root_path`, you can do it normally, as you would expect.

FastAPI will internally use the `root_path` smartly, so it will just work. ✨
````

## File: docs/en/docs/advanced/custom-response.md
````markdown
# Custom Response - HTML, Stream, File, others

By default, **FastAPI** will return the responses using `JSONResponse`.

You can override it by returning a `Response` directly as seen in [Return a Response directly](response-directly.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

But if you return a `Response` directly (or any subclass, like `JSONResponse`), the data won't be automatically converted (even if you declare a `response_model`), and the documentation won't be automatically generated (for example, including the specific "media type", in the HTTP header `Content-Type` as part of the generated OpenAPI).

But you can also declare the `Response` that you want to be used (e.g. any `Response` subclass), in the *path operation decorator* using the `response_class` parameter.

The contents that you return from your *path operation function* will be put inside of that `Response`.

And if that `Response` has a JSON media type (`application/json`), like is the case with the `JSONResponse` and `UJSONResponse`, the data you return will be automatically converted (and filtered) with any Pydantic `response_model` that you declared in the *path operation decorator*.

/// note

If you use a response class with no media type, FastAPI will expect your response to have no content, so it will not document the response format in its generated OpenAPI docs.

///

## Use `ORJSONResponse`

For example, if you are squeezing performance, you can install and use <a href="https://github.com/ijl/orjson" class="external-link" target="_blank">`orjson`</a> and set the response to be `ORJSONResponse`.

Import the `Response` class (sub-class) you want to use and declare it in the *path operation decorator*.

For large responses, returning a `Response` directly is much faster than returning a dictionary.

This is because by default, FastAPI will inspect every item inside and make sure it is serializable as JSON, using the same [JSON Compatible Encoder](../tutorial/encoder.md){.internal-link target=_blank} explained in the tutorial. This is what allows you to return **arbitrary objects**, for example database models.

But if you are certain that the content that you are returning is **serializable with JSON**, you can pass it directly to the response class and avoid the extra overhead that FastAPI would have by passing your return content through the `jsonable_encoder` before passing it to the response class.

{* ../../docs_src/custom_response/tutorial001b.py hl[2,7] *}

/// info

The parameter `response_class` will also be used to define the "media type" of the response.

In this case, the HTTP header `Content-Type` will be set to `application/json`.

And it will be documented as such in OpenAPI.

///

/// tip

The `ORJSONResponse` is only available in FastAPI, not in Starlette.

///

## HTML Response

To return a response with HTML directly from **FastAPI**, use `HTMLResponse`.

* Import `HTMLResponse`.
* Pass `HTMLResponse` as the parameter `response_class` of your *path operation decorator*.

{* ../../docs_src/custom_response/tutorial002.py hl[2,7] *}

/// info

The parameter `response_class` will also be used to define the "media type" of the response.

In this case, the HTTP header `Content-Type` will be set to `text/html`.

And it will be documented as such in OpenAPI.

///

### Return a `Response`

As seen in [Return a Response directly](response-directly.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, you can also override the response directly in your *path operation*, by returning it.

The same example from above, returning an `HTMLResponse`, could look like:

{* ../../docs_src/custom_response/tutorial003.py hl[2,7,19] *}

/// warning

A `Response` returned directly by your *path operation function* won't be documented in OpenAPI (for example, the `Content-Type` won't be documented) and won't be visible in the automatic interactive docs.

///

/// info

Of course, the actual `Content-Type` header, status code, etc, will come from the `Response` object you returned.

///

### Document in OpenAPI and override `Response`

If you want to override the response from inside of the function but at the same time document the "media type" in OpenAPI, you can use the `response_class` parameter AND return a `Response` object.

The `response_class` will then be used only to document the OpenAPI *path operation*, but your `Response` will be used as is.

#### Return an `HTMLResponse` directly

For example, it could be something like:

{* ../../docs_src/custom_response/tutorial004.py hl[7,21,23] *}

In this example, the function `generate_html_response()` already generates and returns a `Response` instead of returning the HTML in a `str`.

By returning the result of calling `generate_html_response()`, you are already returning a `Response` that will override the default **FastAPI** behavior.

But as you passed the `HTMLResponse` in the `response_class` too, **FastAPI** will know how to document it in OpenAPI and the interactive docs as HTML with `text/html`:

<img src="/img/tutorial/custom-response/image01.png">

## Available responses

Here are some of the available responses.

Keep in mind that you can use `Response` to return anything else, or even create a custom sub-class.

/// note | Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette.responses import HTMLResponse`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.responses` as `fastapi.responses` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available responses come directly from Starlette.

///

### `Response`

The main `Response` class, all the other responses inherit from it.

You can return it directly.

It accepts the following parameters:

* `content` - A `str` or `bytes`.
* `status_code` - An `int` HTTP status code.
* `headers` - A `dict` of strings.
* `media_type` - A `str` giving the media type. E.g. `"text/html"`.

FastAPI (actually Starlette) will automatically include a Content-Length header. It will also include a Content-Type header, based on the `media_type` and appending a charset for text types.

{* ../../docs_src/response_directly/tutorial002.py hl[1,18] *}

### `HTMLResponse`

Takes some text or bytes and returns an HTML response, as you read above.

### `PlainTextResponse`

Takes some text or bytes and returns a plain text response.

{* ../../docs_src/custom_response/tutorial005.py hl[2,7,9] *}

### `JSONResponse`

Takes some data and returns an `application/json` encoded response.

This is the default response used in **FastAPI**, as you read above.

### `ORJSONResponse`

A fast alternative JSON response using <a href="https://github.com/ijl/orjson" class="external-link" target="_blank">`orjson`</a>, as you read above.

/// info

This requires installing `orjson` for example with `pip install orjson`.

///

### `UJSONResponse`

An alternative JSON response using <a href="https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson" class="external-link" target="_blank">`ujson`</a>.

/// info

This requires installing `ujson` for example with `pip install ujson`.

///

/// warning

`ujson` is less careful than Python's built-in implementation in how it handles some edge-cases.

///

{* ../../docs_src/custom_response/tutorial001.py hl[2,7] *}

/// tip

It's possible that `ORJSONResponse` might be a faster alternative.

///

### `RedirectResponse`

Returns an HTTP redirect. Uses a 307 status code (Temporary Redirect) by default.

You can return a `RedirectResponse` directly:

{* ../../docs_src/custom_response/tutorial006.py hl[2,9] *}

---

Or you can use it in the `response_class` parameter:


{* ../../docs_src/custom_response/tutorial006b.py hl[2,7,9] *}

If you do that, then you can return the URL directly from your *path operation* function.

In this case, the `status_code` used will be the default one for the `RedirectResponse`, which is `307`.

---

You can also use the `status_code` parameter combined with the `response_class` parameter:

{* ../../docs_src/custom_response/tutorial006c.py hl[2,7,9] *}

### `StreamingResponse`

Takes an async generator or a normal generator/iterator and streams the response body.

{* ../../docs_src/custom_response/tutorial007.py hl[2,14] *}

#### Using `StreamingResponse` with file-like objects

If you have a file-like object (e.g. the object returned by `open()`), you can create a generator function to iterate over that file-like object.

That way, you don't have to read it all first in memory, and you can pass that generator function to the `StreamingResponse`, and return it.

This includes many libraries to interact with cloud storage, video processing, and others.

{* ../../docs_src/custom_response/tutorial008.py hl[2,10:12,14] *}

1. This is the generator function. It's a "generator function" because it contains `yield` statements inside.
2. By using a `with` block, we make sure that the file-like object is closed after the generator function is done. So, after it finishes sending the response.
3. This `yield from` tells the function to iterate over that thing named `file_like`. And then, for each part iterated, yield that part as coming from this generator function (`iterfile`).

    So, it is a generator function that transfers the "generating" work to something else internally.

    By doing it this way, we can put it in a `with` block, and that way, ensure that the file-like object is closed after finishing.

/// tip

Notice that here as we are using standard `open()` that doesn't support `async` and `await`, we declare the path operation with normal `def`.

///

### `FileResponse`

Asynchronously streams a file as the response.

Takes a different set of arguments to instantiate than the other response types:

* `path` - The file path to the file to stream.
* `headers` - Any custom headers to include, as a dictionary.
* `media_type` - A string giving the media type. If unset, the filename or path will be used to infer a media type.
* `filename` - If set, this will be included in the response `Content-Disposition`.

File responses will include appropriate `Content-Length`, `Last-Modified` and `ETag` headers.

{* ../../docs_src/custom_response/tutorial009.py hl[2,10] *}

You can also use the `response_class` parameter:

{* ../../docs_src/custom_response/tutorial009b.py hl[2,8,10] *}

In this case, you can return the file path directly from your *path operation* function.

## Custom response class

You can create your own custom response class, inheriting from `Response` and using it.

For example, let's say that you want to use <a href="https://github.com/ijl/orjson" class="external-link" target="_blank">`orjson`</a>, but with some custom settings not used in the included `ORJSONResponse` class.

Let's say you want it to return indented and formatted JSON, so you want to use the orjson option `orjson.OPT_INDENT_2`.

You could create a `CustomORJSONResponse`. The main thing you have to do is create a `Response.render(content)` method that returns the content as `bytes`:

{* ../../docs_src/custom_response/tutorial009c.py hl[9:14,17] *}

Now instead of returning:

```json
{"message": "Hello World"}
```

...this response will return:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello World"
}
```

Of course, you will probably find much better ways to take advantage of this than formatting JSON. 😉

## Default response class

When creating a **FastAPI** class instance or an `APIRouter` you can specify which response class to use by default.

The parameter that defines this is `default_response_class`.

In the example below, **FastAPI** will use `ORJSONResponse` by default, in all *path operations*, instead of `JSONResponse`.

{* ../../docs_src/custom_response/tutorial010.py hl[2,4] *}

/// tip

You can still override `response_class` in *path operations* as before.

///

## Additional documentation

You can also declare the media type and many other details in OpenAPI using `responses`: [Additional Responses in OpenAPI](additional-responses.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.
````

## File: docs/en/docs/advanced/dataclasses.md
````markdown
# Using Dataclasses

FastAPI is built on top of **Pydantic**, and I have been showing you how to use Pydantic models to declare requests and responses.

But FastAPI also supports using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html" class="external-link" target="_blank">`dataclasses`</a> the same way:

{* ../../docs_src/dataclasses/tutorial001.py hl[1,7:12,19:20] *}

This is still supported thanks to **Pydantic**, as it has <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/dataclasses/#use-of-stdlib-dataclasses-with-basemodel" class="external-link" target="_blank">internal support for `dataclasses`</a>.

So, even with the code above that doesn't use Pydantic explicitly, FastAPI is using Pydantic to convert those standard dataclasses to Pydantic's own flavor of dataclasses.

And of course, it supports the same:

* data validation
* data serialization
* data documentation, etc.

This works the same way as with Pydantic models. And it is actually achieved in the same way underneath, using Pydantic.

/// info

Keep in mind that dataclasses can't do everything Pydantic models can do.

So, you might still need to use Pydantic models.

But if you have a bunch of dataclasses laying around, this is a nice trick to use them to power a web API using FastAPI. 🤓

///

## Dataclasses in `response_model`

You can also use `dataclasses` in the `response_model` parameter:

{* ../../docs_src/dataclasses/tutorial002.py hl[1,7:13,19] *}

The dataclass will be automatically converted to a Pydantic dataclass.

This way, its schema will show up in the API docs user interface:

<img src="/img/tutorial/dataclasses/image01.png">

## Dataclasses in Nested Data Structures

You can also combine `dataclasses` with other type annotations to make nested data structures.

In some cases, you might still have to use Pydantic's version of `dataclasses`. For example, if you have errors with the automatically generated API documentation.

In that case, you can simply swap the standard `dataclasses` with `pydantic.dataclasses`, which is a drop-in replacement:

{* ../../docs_src/dataclasses/tutorial003.py hl[1,5,8:11,14:17,23:25,28] *}

1. We still import `field` from standard `dataclasses`.

2. `pydantic.dataclasses` is a drop-in replacement for `dataclasses`.

3. The `Author` dataclass includes a list of `Item` dataclasses.

4. The `Author` dataclass is used as the `response_model` parameter.

5. You can use other standard type annotations with dataclasses as the request body.

    In this case, it's a list of `Item` dataclasses.

6. Here we are returning a dictionary that contains `items` which is a list of dataclasses.

    FastAPI is still capable of <abbr title="converting the data to a format that can be transmitted">serializing</abbr> the data to JSON.

7. Here the `response_model` is using a type annotation of a list of `Author` dataclasses.

    Again, you can combine `dataclasses` with standard type annotations.

8. Notice that this *path operation function* uses regular `def` instead of `async def`.

    As always, in FastAPI you can combine `def` and `async def` as needed.

    If you need a refresher about when to use which, check out the section _"In a hurry?"_ in the docs about [`async` and `await`](../async.md#in-a-hurry){.internal-link target=_blank}.

9. This *path operation function* is not returning dataclasses (although it could), but a list of dictionaries with internal data.

    FastAPI will use the `response_model` parameter (that includes dataclasses) to convert the response.

You can combine `dataclasses` with other type annotations in many different combinations to form complex data structures.

Check the in-code annotation tips above to see more specific details.

## Learn More

You can also combine `dataclasses` with other Pydantic models, inherit from them, include them in your own models, etc.

To learn more, check the <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/dataclasses/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic docs about dataclasses</a>.

````markdown
# Lifespan Events

You can define logic (code) that should be executed before the application **starts up**. This means that this code will be executed **once**, **before** the application **starts receiving requests**.

The same way, you can define logic (code) that should be executed when the application is **shutting down**. In this case, this code will be executed **once**, **after** having handled possibly **many requests**.

Because this code is executed before the application **starts** taking requests, and right after it **finishes** handling requests, it covers the whole application **lifespan** (the word "lifespan" will be important in a second 😉).

This can be very useful for setting up **resources** that you need to use for the whole app, and that are **shared** among requests, and/or that you need to **clean up** afterwards. For example, a database connection pool, or loading a shared machine learning model.

## Use Case

Let's start with an example **use case** and then see how to solve it with this.

Let's imagine that you have some **machine learning models** that you want to use to handle requests. 🤖

The same models are shared among requests, so, it's not one model per request, or one per user or something similar.

Let's imagine that loading the model can **take quite some time**, because it has to read a lot of **data from disk**. So you don't want to do it for every request.

You could load it at the top level of the module/file, but that would also mean that it would **load the model** even if you are just running a simple automated test, then that test would be **slow** because it would have to wait for the model to load before being able to run an independent part of the code.

That's what we'll solve, let's load the model before the requests are handled, but only right before the application starts receiving requests, not while  the code is being loaded.

## Lifespan

You can define this *startup* and *shutdown* logic using the `lifespan` parameter of the `FastAPI` app, and a "context manager" (I'll show you what that is in a second).

Let's start with an example and then see it in detail.

We create an async function `lifespan()` with `yield` like this:

{* ../../docs_src/events/tutorial003.py hl[16,19] *}

Here we are simulating the expensive *startup* operation of loading the model by putting the (fake) model function in the dictionary with machine learning models before the `yield`. This code will be executed **before** the application **starts taking requests**, during the *startup*.

And then, right after the `yield`, we unload the model. This code will be executed **after** the application **finishes handling requests**, right before the *shutdown*. This could, for example, release resources like memory or a GPU.

/// tip

The `shutdown` would happen when you are **stopping** the application.

Maybe you need to start a new version, or you just got tired of running it. 🤷

///

### Lifespan function

The first thing to notice, is that we are defining an async function with `yield`. This is very similar to Dependencies with `yield`.

{* ../../docs_src/events/tutorial003.py hl[14:19] *}

The first part of the function, before the `yield`, will be executed **before** the application starts.

And the part after the `yield` will be executed **after** the application has finished.

### Async Context Manager

If you check, the function is decorated with an `@asynccontextmanager`.

That converts the function into something called an "**async context manager**".

{* ../../docs_src/events/tutorial003.py hl[1,13] *}

A **context manager** in Python is something that you can use in a `with` statement, for example, `open()` can be used as a context manager:

```Python
with open("file.txt") as file:
    file.read()
```

In recent versions of Python, there's also an **async context manager**. You would use it with `async with`:

```Python
async with lifespan(app):
    await do_stuff()
```

When you create a context manager or an async context manager like above, what it does is that, before entering the `with` block, it will execute the code before the `yield`, and after exiting the `with` block, it will execute the code after the `yield`.

In our code example above, we don't use it directly, but we pass it to FastAPI for it to use it.

The `lifespan` parameter of the `FastAPI` app takes an **async context manager**, so we can pass our new `lifespan` async context manager to it.

{* ../../docs_src/events/tutorial003.py hl[22] *}

## Alternative Events (deprecated)

/// warning

The recommended way to handle the *startup* and *shutdown* is using the `lifespan` parameter of the `FastAPI` app as described above. If you provide a `lifespan` parameter, `startup` and `shutdown` event handlers will no longer be called. It's all `lifespan` or all events, not both.

You can probably skip this part.

///

There's an alternative way to define this logic to be executed during *startup* and during *shutdown*.

You can define event handlers (functions) that need to be executed before the application starts up, or when the application is shutting down.

These functions can be declared with `async def` or normal `def`.

### `startup` event

To add a function that should be run before the application starts, declare it with the event `"startup"`:

{* ../../docs_src/events/tutorial001.py hl[8] *}

In this case, the `startup` event handler function will initialize the items "database" (just a `dict`) with some values.

You can add more than one event handler function.

And your application won't start receiving requests until all the `startup` event handlers have completed.

### `shutdown` event

To add a function that should be run when the application is shutting down, declare it with the event `"shutdown"`:

{* ../../docs_src/events/tutorial002.py hl[6] *}

Here, the `shutdown` event handler function will write a text line `"Application shutdown"` to a file `log.txt`.

/// info

In the `open()` function, the `mode="a"` means "append", so, the line will be added after whatever is on that file, without overwriting the previous contents.

///

/// tip

Notice that in this case we are using a standard Python `open()` function that interacts with a file.

So, it involves I/O (input/output), that requires "waiting" for things to be written to disk.

But `open()` doesn't use `async` and `await`.

So, we declare the event handler function with standard `def` instead of `async def`.

///

### `startup` and `shutdown` together

There's a high chance that the logic for your *startup* and *shutdown* is connected, you might want to start something and then finish it, acquire a resource and then release it, etc.

Doing that in separated functions that don't share logic or variables together is more difficult as you would need to store values in global variables or similar tricks.

Because of that, it's now recommended to instead use the `lifespan` as explained above.

# Generate Clients

As **FastAPI** is based on the OpenAPI specification, you get automatic compatibility with many tools, including the automatic API docs (provided by Swagger UI).

One particular advantage that is not necessarily obvious is that you can **generate clients** (sometimes called <abbr title="Software Development Kits">**SDKs**</abbr> ) for your API, for many different **programming languages**.

## OpenAPI Client Generators

There are many tools to generate clients from **OpenAPI**.

A common tool is <a href="https://openapi-generator.tech/" class="external-link" target="_blank">OpenAPI Generator</a>.

If you are building a **frontend**, a very interesting alternative is <a href="https://github.com/hey-api/openapi-ts" class="external-link" target="_blank">openapi-ts</a>.

## Client and SDK Generators - Sponsor

There are also some **company-backed** Client and SDK generators based on OpenAPI (FastAPI), in some cases they can offer you **additional features** on top of high-quality generated SDKs/clients.

Some of them also ✨ [**sponsor FastAPI**](../help-fastapi.md#sponsor-the-author){.internal-link target=_blank} ✨, this ensures the continued and healthy **development** of FastAPI and its **ecosystem**.

And it shows their true commitment to FastAPI and its **community** (you), as they not only want to provide you a **good service** but also want to make sure you have a **good and healthy framework**, FastAPI. 🙇

For example, you might want to try:

* <a href="https://speakeasy.com/editor?utm_source=fastapi+repo&utm_medium=github+sponsorship" class="external-link" target="_blank">Speakeasy</a>
* <a href="https://www.stainlessapi.com/?utm_source=fastapi&utm_medium=referral" class="external-link" target="_blank">Stainless</a>
* <a href="https://developers.liblab.com/tutorials/sdk-for-fastapi?utm_source=fastapi" class="external-link" target="_blank">liblab</a>

There are also several other companies offering similar services that you can search and find online. 🤓

## Generate a TypeScript Frontend Client

Let's start with a simple FastAPI application:

{* ../../docs_src/generate_clients/tutorial001_py39.py hl[7:9,12:13,16:17,21] *}

Notice that the *path operations* define the models they use for request payload and response payload, using the models `Item` and `ResponseMessage`.

### API Docs

If you go to the API docs, you will see that it has the **schemas** for the data to be sent in requests and received in responses:

<img src="/img/tutorial/generate-clients/image01.png">

You can see those schemas because they were declared with the models in the app.

That information is available in the app's **OpenAPI schema**, and then shown in the API docs (by Swagger UI).

And that same information from the models that is included in OpenAPI is what can be used to **generate the client code**.

### Generate a TypeScript Client

Now that we have the app with the models, we can generate the client code for the frontend.

#### Install `openapi-ts`

You can install `openapi-ts` in your frontend code with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ npm install @hey-api/openapi-ts --save-dev

---> 100%
```

</div>

#### Generate Client Code

To generate the client code you can use the command line application `openapi-ts` that would now be installed.

Because it is installed in the local project, you probably wouldn't be able to call that command directly, but you would put it on your `package.json` file.

It could look like this:

```JSON  hl_lines="7"
{
  "name": "frontend-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "generate-client": "openapi-ts --input http://localhost:8000/openapi.json --output ./src/client --client axios"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@hey-api/openapi-ts": "^0.27.38",
    "typescript": "^4.6.2"
  }
}
```

After having that NPM `generate-client` script there, you can run it with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ npm run generate-client

frontend-app@1.0.0 generate-client /home/user/code/frontend-app
> openapi-ts --input http://localhost:8000/openapi.json --output ./src/client --client axios
```

</div>

That command will generate code in `./src/client` and will use `axios` (the frontend HTTP library) internally.

### Try Out the Client Code

Now you can import and use the client code, it could look like this, notice that you get autocompletion for the methods:

<img src="/img/tutorial/generate-clients/image02.png">

You will also get autocompletion for the payload to send:

<img src="/img/tutorial/generate-clients/image03.png">

/// tip

Notice the autocompletion for `name` and `price`, that was defined in the FastAPI application, in the `Item` model.

///

You will have inline errors for the data that you send:

<img src="/img/tutorial/generate-clients/image04.png">

The response object will also have autocompletion:

<img src="/img/tutorial/generate-clients/image05.png">

## FastAPI App with Tags

In many cases your FastAPI app will be bigger, and you will probably use tags to separate different groups of *path operations*.

For example, you could have a section for **items** and another section for **users**, and they could be separated by tags:

{* ../../docs_src/generate_clients/tutorial002_py39.py hl[21,26,34] *}

### Generate a TypeScript Client with Tags

If you generate a client for a FastAPI app using tags, it will normally also separate the client code based on the tags.

This way you will be able to have things ordered and grouped correctly for the client code:

<img src="/img/tutorial/generate-clients/image06.png">

In this case you have:

* `ItemsService`
* `UsersService`

### Client Method Names

Right now the generated method names like `createItemItemsPost` don't look very clean:

```TypeScript
ItemsService.createItemItemsPost({name: "Plumbus", price: 5})
```

...that's because the client generator uses the OpenAPI internal **operation ID** for each *path operation*.

OpenAPI requires that each operation ID is unique across all the *path operations*, so FastAPI uses the **function name**, the **path**, and the **HTTP method/operation** to generate that operation ID, because that way it can make sure that the operation IDs are unique.

But I'll show you how to improve that next. 🤓

## Custom Operation IDs and Better Method Names

You can **modify** the way these operation IDs are **generated** to make them simpler and have **simpler method names** in the clients.

In this case you will have to ensure that each operation ID is **unique** in some other way.

For example, you could make sure that each *path operation* has a tag, and then generate the operation ID based on the **tag** and the *path operation* **name** (the function name).

### Custom Generate Unique ID Function

FastAPI uses a **unique ID** for each *path operation*, it is used for the **operation ID** and also for the names of any needed custom models, for requests or responses.

You can customize that function. It takes an `APIRoute` and outputs a string.

For example, here it is using the first tag (you will probably have only one tag) and the *path operation* name (the function name).

You can then pass that custom function to **FastAPI** as the `generate_unique_id_function` parameter:

{* ../../docs_src/generate_clients/tutorial003_py39.py hl[6:7,10] *}

### Generate a TypeScript Client with Custom Operation IDs

Now if you generate the client again, you will see that it has the improved method names:

<img src="/img/tutorial/generate-clients/image07.png">

As you see, the method names now have the tag and then the function name, now they don't include information from the URL path and the HTTP operation.

### Preprocess the OpenAPI Specification for the Client Generator

The generated code still has some **duplicated information**.

We already know that this method is related to the **items** because that word is in the `ItemsService` (taken from the tag), but we still have the tag name prefixed in the method name too. 😕

We will probably still want to keep it for OpenAPI in general, as that will ensure that the operation IDs are **unique**.

But for the generated client we could **modify** the OpenAPI operation IDs right before generating the clients, just to make those method names nicer and **cleaner**.

We could download the OpenAPI JSON to a file `openapi.json` and then we could **remove that prefixed tag** with a script like this:

{* ../../docs_src/generate_clients/tutorial004.py *}

//// tab | Node.js

```Javascript
{!> ../../docs_src/generate_clients/tutorial004.js!}
```

////

With that, the operation IDs would be renamed from things like `items-get_items` to just `get_items`, that way the client generator can generate simpler method names.

### Generate a TypeScript Client with the Preprocessed OpenAPI

Now as the end result is in a file `openapi.json`, you would modify the `package.json` to use that local file, for example:

```JSON  hl_lines="7"
{
  "name": "frontend-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "generate-client": "openapi-ts --input ./openapi.json --output ./src/client --client axios"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@hey-api/openapi-ts": "^0.27.38",
    "typescript": "^4.6.2"
  }
}
```

After generating the new client, you would now have **clean method names**, with all the **autocompletion**, **inline errors**, etc:

<img src="/img/tutorial/generate-clients/image08.png">

## Benefits

When using the automatically generated clients you would get **autocompletion** for:

* Methods.
* Request payloads in the body, query parameters, etc.
* Response payloads.

You would also have **inline errors** for everything.

And whenever you update the backend code, and **regenerate** the frontend, it would have any new *path operations* available as methods, the old ones removed, and any other change would be reflected on the generated code. 🤓

This also means that if something changed it will be **reflected** on the client code automatically. And if you **build** the client it will error out if you have any **mismatch** in the data used.

So, you would **detect many errors** very early in the development cycle instead of having to wait for the errors to show up to your final users in production and then trying to debug where the problem is. ✨

The main [Tutorial - User Guide](../tutorial/index.md){.internal-link target=_blank} should be enough to give you a tour through all the main features of **FastAPI**.

In the next sections you will see other options, configurations, and additional features.

/// tip

The next sections are **not necessarily "advanced"**.

And it's possible that for your use case, the solution is in one of them.

## Read the Tutorial first

You could still use most of the features in **FastAPI** with the knowledge from the main [Tutorial - User Guide](../tutorial/index.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

## File: docs/en/docs/advanced/middleware.md
````markdown
# Advanced Middleware

In the main tutorial you read how to add [Custom Middleware](../tutorial/middleware.md){.internal-link target=_blank} to your application.

And then you also read how to handle [CORS with the `CORSMiddleware`](../tutorial/cors.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

In this section we'll see how to use other middlewares.

## Adding ASGI middlewares

As **FastAPI** is based on Starlette and implements the <abbr title="Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface">ASGI</abbr> specification, you can use any ASGI middleware.

A middleware doesn't have to be made for FastAPI or Starlette to work, as long as it follows the ASGI spec.

In general, ASGI middlewares are classes that expect to receive an ASGI app as the first argument.

So, in the documentation for third-party ASGI middlewares they will probably tell you to do something like:

```Python
from unicorn import UnicornMiddleware

app = SomeASGIApp()

new_app = UnicornMiddleware(app, some_config="rainbow")
```

But FastAPI (actually Starlette) provides a simpler way to do it that makes sure that the internal middlewares handle server errors and custom exception handlers work properly.

For that, you use `app.add_middleware()` (as in the example for CORS).

```Python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from unicorn import UnicornMiddleware

app = FastAPI()

app.add_middleware(UnicornMiddleware, some_config="rainbow")
```

`app.add_middleware()` receives a middleware class as the first argument and any additional arguments to be passed to the middleware.

## Integrated middlewares

**FastAPI** includes several middlewares for common use cases, we'll see next how to use them.

/// note | Technical Details

For the next examples, you could also use `from starlette.middleware.something import SomethingMiddleware`.

**FastAPI** provides several middlewares in `fastapi.middleware` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available middlewares come directly from Starlette.

///

## `HTTPSRedirectMiddleware`

Enforces that all incoming requests must either be `https` or `wss`.

Any incoming request to `http` or `ws` will be redirected to the secure scheme instead.

{* ../../docs_src/advanced_middleware/tutorial001.py hl[2,6] *}

## `TrustedHostMiddleware`

Enforces that all incoming requests have a correctly set `Host` header, in order to guard against HTTP Host Header attacks.

{* ../../docs_src/advanced_middleware/tutorial002.py hl[2,6:8] *}

The following arguments are supported:

* `allowed_hosts` - A list of domain names that should be allowed as hostnames. Wildcard domains such as `*.example.com` are supported for matching subdomains. To allow any hostname either use `allowed_hosts=["*"]` or omit the middleware.

If an incoming request does not validate correctly then a `400` response will be sent.

## `GZipMiddleware`

Handles GZip responses for any request that includes `"gzip"` in the `Accept-Encoding` header.

The middleware will handle both standard and streaming responses.

{* ../../docs_src/advanced_middleware/tutorial003.py hl[2,6] *}

The following arguments are supported:

* `minimum_size` - Do not GZip responses that are smaller than this minimum size in bytes. Defaults to `500`.
* `compresslevel` - Used during GZip compression. It is an integer ranging from 1 to 9. Defaults to `9`. Lower value results in faster compression but larger file sizes, while higher value results in slower compression but smaller file sizes.

## Other middlewares

There are many other ASGI middlewares.

For example:

## File: docs/en/docs/advanced/openapi-callbacks.md
````markdown
# OpenAPI Callbacks

You could create an API with a *path operation* that could trigger a request to an *external API* created by someone else (probably the same developer that would be *using* your API).

The process that happens when your API app calls the *external API* is named a "callback". Because the software that the external developer wrote sends a request to your API and then your API *calls back*, sending a request to an *external API* (that was probably created by the same developer).

In this case, you could want to document how that external API *should* look like. What *path operation* it should have, what body it should expect, what response it should return, etc.

## An app with callbacks

Let's see all this with an example.

Imagine you develop an app that allows creating invoices.

These invoices will have an `id`, `title` (optional), `customer`, and `total`.

The user of your API (an external developer) will create an invoice in your API with a POST request.

Then your API will (let's imagine):

* Send the invoice to some customer of the external developer.
* Collect the money.
* Send a notification back to the API user (the external developer).
    * This will be done by sending a POST request (from *your API*) to some *external API* provided by that external developer (this is the "callback").

## The normal **FastAPI** app

Let's first see how the normal API app would look like before adding the callback.

It will have a *path operation* that will receive an `Invoice` body, and a query parameter `callback_url` that will contain the URL for the callback.

This part is pretty normal, most of the code is probably already familiar to you:

{* ../../docs_src/openapi_callbacks/tutorial001.py hl[9:13,36:53] *}

/// tip

The `callback_url` query parameter uses a Pydantic <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/networks/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Url</a> type.

///

The only new thing is the `callbacks=invoices_callback_router.routes` as an argument to the *path operation decorator*. We'll see what that is next.

## Documenting the callback

The actual callback code will depend heavily on your own API app.

And it will probably vary a lot from one app to the next.

It could be just one or two lines of code, like:

```Python
callback_url = "https://example.com/api/v1/invoices/events/"
httpx.post(callback_url, json={"description": "Invoice paid", "paid": True})
```

But possibly the most important part of the callback is making sure that your API user (the external developer) implements the *external API* correctly, according to the data that *your API* is going to send in the request body of the callback, etc.

So, what we will do next is add the code to document how that *external API* should look like to receive the callback from *your API*.

That documentation will show up in the Swagger UI at `/docs` in your API, and it will let external developers know how to build the *external API*.

This example doesn't implement the callback itself (that could be just a line of code), only the documentation part.

/// tip

The actual callback is just an HTTP request.

When implementing the callback yourself, you could use something like <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org" class="external-link" target="_blank">HTTPX</a> or <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Requests</a>.

///

## Write the callback documentation code

This code won't be executed in your app, we only need it to *document* how that *external API* should look like.

But, you already know how to easily create automatic documentation for an API with **FastAPI**.

So we are going to use that same knowledge to document how the *external API* should look like... by creating the *path operation(s)* that the external API should implement (the ones your API will call).

/// tip

When writing the code to document a callback, it might be useful to imagine that you are that *external developer*. And that you are currently implementing the *external API*, not *your API*.

Temporarily adopting this point of view (of the *external developer*) can help you feel like it's more obvious where to put the parameters, the Pydantic model for the body, for the response, etc. for that *external API*.

///

### Create a callback `APIRouter`

First create a new `APIRouter` that will contain one or more callbacks.

{* ../../docs_src/openapi_callbacks/tutorial001.py hl[3,25] *}

### Create the callback *path operation*

To create the callback *path operation* use the same `APIRouter` you created above.

It should look just like a normal FastAPI *path operation*:

* It should probably have a declaration of the body it should receive, e.g. `body: InvoiceEvent`.
* And it could also have a declaration of the response it should return, e.g. `response_model=InvoiceEventReceived`.

{* ../../docs_src/openapi_callbacks/tutorial001.py hl[16:18,21:22,28:32] *}

There are 2 main differences from a normal *path operation*:

* It doesn't need to have any actual code, because your app will never call this code. It's only used to document the *external API*. So, the function could just have `pass`.
* The *path* can contain an <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.1.0.md#key-expression" class="external-link" target="_blank">OpenAPI 3 expression</a> (see more below) where it can use variables with parameters and parts of the original request sent to *your API*.

### The callback path expression

The callback *path* can have an <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.1.0.md#key-expression" class="external-link" target="_blank">OpenAPI 3 expression</a> that can contain parts of the original request sent to *your API*.

In this case, it's the `str`:

```Python
"{$callback_url}/invoices/{$request.body.id}"
```

So, if your API user (the external developer) sends a request to *your API* to:

```
https://yourapi.com/invoices/?callback_url=https://www.external.org/events
```

with a JSON body of:

```JSON
{
    "id": "2expen51ve",
    "customer": "Mr. Richie Rich",
    "total": "9999"
}
```

then *your API* will process the invoice, and at some point later, send a callback request to the `callback_url` (the *external API*):

```
https://www.external.org/events/invoices/2expen51ve
```

with a JSON body containing something like:

```JSON
{
    "description": "Payment celebration",
    "paid": true
}
```

and it would expect a response from that *external API* with a JSON body like:

```JSON
{
    "ok": true
}
```

/// tip

Notice how the callback URL used contains the URL received as a query parameter in `callback_url` (`https://www.external.org/events`) and also the invoice `id` from inside of the JSON body (`2expen51ve`).

///

### Add the callback router

At this point you have the *callback path operation(s)* needed (the one(s) that the *external developer*  should implement in the *external API*) in the callback router you created above.

Now use the parameter `callbacks` in *your API's path operation decorator* to pass the attribute `.routes` (that's actually just a `list` of routes/*path operations*) from that callback router:

{* ../../docs_src/openapi_callbacks/tutorial001.py hl[35] *}

/// tip

Notice that you are not passing the router itself (`invoices_callback_router`) to `callback=`, but the attribute `.routes`, as in `invoices_callback_router.routes`.

///

### Check the docs

Now you can start your app and go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>.

You will see your docs including a "Callbacks" section for your *path operation* that shows how the *external API* should look like:

## File: docs/en/docs/advanced/openapi-webhooks.md
````markdown
# OpenAPI Webhooks

There are cases where you want to tell your API **users** that your app could call *their* app (sending a request) with some data, normally to **notify** of some type of **event**.

This means that instead of the normal process of your users sending requests to your API, it's **your API** (or your app) that could **send requests to their system** (to their API, their app).

This is normally called a **webhook**.

## Webhooks steps

The process normally is that **you define** in your code what is the message that you will send, the **body of the request**.

You also define in some way at which **moments** your app will send those requests or events.

And **your users** define in some way (for example in a web dashboard somewhere) the **URL** where your app should send those requests.

All the **logic** about how to register the URLs for webhooks and the code to actually send those requests is up to you. You write it however you want to in **your own code**.

## Documenting webhooks with **FastAPI** and OpenAPI

With **FastAPI**, using OpenAPI, you can define the names of these webhooks, the types of HTTP operations that your app can send (e.g. `POST`, `PUT`, etc.) and the request **bodies** that your app would send.

This can make it a lot easier for your users to **implement their APIs** to receive your **webhook** requests, they might even be able to autogenerate some of their own API code.

/// info

Webhooks are available in OpenAPI 3.1.0 and above, supported by FastAPI `0.99.0` and above.

///

## An app with webhooks

When you create a **FastAPI** application, there is a `webhooks` attribute that you can use to define *webhooks*, the same way you would define *path operations*, for example with `@app.webhooks.post()`.

{* ../../docs_src/openapi_webhooks/tutorial001.py hl[9:13,36:53] *}

The webhooks that you define will end up in the **OpenAPI** schema and the automatic **docs UI**.

/// info

The `app.webhooks` object is actually just an `APIRouter`, the same type you would use when structuring your app with multiple files.

///

Notice that with webhooks you are actually not declaring a *path* (like `/items/`), the text you pass there is just an **identifier** of the webhook (the name of the event), for example in `@app.webhooks.post("new-subscription")`, the webhook name is `new-subscription`.

This is because it is expected that **your users** would define the actual **URL path** where they want to receive the webhook request in some other way (e.g. a web dashboard).

### Check the docs

Now you can start your app and go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>.

You will see your docs have the normal *path operations* and now also some **webhooks**:

# Path Operation Advanced Configuration

## OpenAPI operationId

/// warning

If you are not an "expert" in OpenAPI, you probably don't need this.

///

You can set the OpenAPI `operationId` to be used in your *path operation* with the parameter `operation_id`.

You would have to make sure that it is unique for each operation.

{* ../../docs_src/path_operation_advanced_configuration/tutorial001.py hl[6] *}

### Using the *path operation function* name as the operationId

If you want to use your APIs' function names as `operationId`s, you can iterate over all of them and override each *path operation's* `operation_id` using their `APIRoute.name`.

You should do it after adding all your *path operations*.

{* ../../docs_src/path_operation_advanced_configuration/tutorial002.py hl[2, 12:21, 24] *}

/// tip

If you manually call `app.openapi()`, you should update the `operationId`s before that.

///

/// warning

If you do this, you have to make sure each one of your *path operation functions* has a unique name.

Even if they are in different modules (Python files).

///

## Exclude from OpenAPI

To exclude a *path operation* from the generated OpenAPI schema (and thus, from the automatic documentation systems), use the parameter `include_in_schema` and set it to `False`:

{* ../../docs_src/path_operation_advanced_configuration/tutorial003.py hl[6] *}

## Advanced description from docstring

You can limit the lines used from the docstring of a *path operation function* for OpenAPI.

Adding an `\f` (an escaped "form feed" character) causes **FastAPI** to truncate the output used for OpenAPI at this point.

It won't show up in the documentation, but other tools (such as Sphinx) will be able to use the rest.

{* ../../docs_src/path_operation_advanced_configuration/tutorial004.py hl[19:29] *}

## Additional Responses

You probably have seen how to declare the `response_model` and `status_code` for a *path operation*.

That defines the metadata about the main response of a *path operation*.

You can also declare additional responses with their models, status codes, etc.

There's a whole chapter here in the documentation about it, you can read it at [Additional Responses in OpenAPI](additional-responses.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

## OpenAPI Extra

When you declare a *path operation* in your application, **FastAPI** automatically generates the relevant metadata about that *path operation* to be included in the OpenAPI schema.

/// note | Technical details

In the OpenAPI specification it is called the <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#operation-object" class="external-link" target="_blank">Operation Object</a>.

It has all the information about the *path operation* and is used to generate the automatic documentation.

It includes the `tags`, `parameters`, `requestBody`, `responses`, etc.

This *path operation*-specific OpenAPI schema is normally generated automatically by **FastAPI**, but you can also extend it.

/// tip

This is a low level extension point.

If you only need to declare additional responses, a more convenient way to do it is with [Additional Responses in OpenAPI](additional-responses.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

///

You can extend the OpenAPI schema for a *path operation* using the parameter `openapi_extra`.

### OpenAPI Extensions

This `openapi_extra` can be helpful, for example, to declare [OpenAPI Extensions](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#specificationExtensions):

{* ../../docs_src/path_operation_advanced_configuration/tutorial005.py hl[6] *}

If you open the automatic API docs, your extension will show up at the bottom of the specific *path operation*.

<img src="/img/tutorial/path-operation-advanced-configuration/image01.png">

And if you see the resulting OpenAPI (at `/openapi.json` in your API), you will see your extension as part of the specific *path operation* too:

```JSON hl_lines="22"
{
    "openapi": "3.1.0",
    "info": {
        "title": "FastAPI",
        "version": "0.1.0"
    },
    "paths": {
        "/items/": {
            "get": {
                "summary": "Read Items",
                "operationId": "read_items_items__get",
                "responses": {
                    "200": {
                        "description": "Successful Response",
                        "content": {
                            "application/json": {
                                "schema": {}
                            }
                        }
                    }
                },
                "x-aperture-labs-portal": "blue"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Custom OpenAPI *path operation* schema

The dictionary in `openapi_extra` will be deeply merged with the automatically generated OpenAPI schema for the *path operation*.

So, you could add additional data to the automatically generated schema.

For example, you could decide to read and validate the request with your own code, without using the automatic features of FastAPI with Pydantic, but you could still want to define the request in the OpenAPI schema.

You could do that with `openapi_extra`:

{* ../../docs_src/path_operation_advanced_configuration/tutorial006.py hl[19:36, 39:40] *}

In this example, we didn't declare any Pydantic model. In fact, the request body is not even <abbr title="converted from some plain format, like bytes, into Python objects">parsed</abbr> as JSON, it is read directly as `bytes`, and the function `magic_data_reader()` would be in charge of parsing it in some way.

Nevertheless, we can declare the expected schema for the request body.

### Custom OpenAPI content type

Using this same trick, you could use a Pydantic model to define the JSON Schema that is then included in the custom OpenAPI schema section for the *path operation*.

And you could do this even if the data type in the request is not JSON.

For example, in this application we don't use FastAPI's integrated functionality to extract the JSON Schema from Pydantic models nor the automatic validation for JSON. In fact, we are declaring the request content type as YAML, not JSON:

//// tab | Pydantic v2

{* ../../docs_src/path_operation_advanced_configuration/tutorial007.py hl[17:22, 24] *}

////

//// tab | Pydantic v1

{* ../../docs_src/path_operation_advanced_configuration/tutorial007_pv1.py hl[17:22, 24] *}

////

/// info

In Pydantic version 1 the method to get the JSON Schema for a model was called `Item.schema()`, in Pydantic version 2, the method is called `Item.model_json_schema()`.

///

Nevertheless, although we are not using the default integrated functionality, we are still using a Pydantic model to manually generate the JSON Schema for the data that we want to receive in YAML.

Then we use the request directly, and extract the body as `bytes`. This means that FastAPI won't even try to parse the request payload as JSON.

And then in our code, we parse that YAML content directly, and then we are again using the same Pydantic model to validate the YAML content:

//// tab | Pydantic v2

{* ../../docs_src/path_operation_advanced_configuration/tutorial007.py hl[26:33] *}

////

//// tab | Pydantic v1

{* ../../docs_src/path_operation_advanced_configuration/tutorial007_pv1.py hl[26:33] *}

////

/// info

In Pydantic version 1 the method to parse and validate an object was `Item.parse_obj()`, in Pydantic version 2, the method is called `Item.model_validate()`.

///

/// tip

Here we reuse the same Pydantic model.

But the same way, we could have validated it in some other way.

# Response - Change Status Code

You probably read before that you can set a default [Response Status Code](../tutorial/response-status-code.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

But in some cases you need to return a different status code than the default.

## Use case

For example, imagine that you want to return an HTTP status code of "OK" `200` by default.

But if the data didn't exist, you want to create it, and return an HTTP status code of "CREATED" `201`.

But you still want to be able to filter and convert the data you return with a `response_model`.

For those cases, you can use a `Response` parameter.

## Use a `Response` parameter

You can declare a parameter of type `Response` in your *path operation function* (as you can do for cookies and headers).

And then you can set the `status_code` in that *temporal* response object.

{* ../../docs_src/response_change_status_code/tutorial001.py hl[1,9,12] *}

And then you can return any object you need, as you normally would (a `dict`, a database model, etc).

And if you declared a `response_model`, it will still be used to filter and convert the object you returned.

**FastAPI** will use that *temporal* response to extract the status code (also cookies and headers), and will put them in the final response that contains the value you returned, filtered by any `response_model`.

You can also declare the `Response` parameter in dependencies, and set the status code in them. But keep in mind that the last one to be set will win.
````

## File: docs/en/docs/advanced/response-cookies.md

# Response Cookies

## Use a `Response` parameter

You can declare a parameter of type `Response` in your *path operation function*.

And then you can set cookies in that *temporal* response object.

{* ../../docs_src/response_cookies/tutorial002.py hl[1, 8:9] *}

And then you can return any object you need, as you normally would (a `dict`, a database model, etc).

And if you declared a `response_model`, it will still be used to filter and convert the object you returned.

**FastAPI** will use that *temporal* response to extract the cookies (also headers and status code), and will put them in the final response that contains the value you returned, filtered by any `response_model`.

You can also declare the `Response` parameter in dependencies, and set cookies (and headers) in them.

## Return a `Response` directly

You can also create cookies when returning a `Response` directly in your code.

To do that, you can create a response as described in [Return a Response Directly](response-directly.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

Then set Cookies in it, and then return it:

{* ../../docs_src/response_cookies/tutorial001.py hl[10:12] *}

/// tip

Keep in mind that if you return a response directly instead of using the `Response` parameter, FastAPI will return it directly.

So, you will have to make sure your data is of the correct type. E.g. it is compatible with JSON, if you are returning a `JSONResponse`.

And also that you are not sending any data that should have been filtered by a `response_model`.

///

### More info

/// note | Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette.responses import Response` or `from starlette.responses import JSONResponse`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.responses` as `fastapi.responses` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available responses come directly from Starlette.

And as the `Response` can be used frequently to set headers and cookies, **FastAPI** also provides it at `fastapi.Response`.

# Return a Response Directly

When you create a **FastAPI** *path operation* you can normally return any data from it: a `dict`, a `list`, a Pydantic model, a database model, etc.

By default, **FastAPI** would automatically convert that return value to JSON using the `jsonable_encoder` explained in [JSON Compatible Encoder](../tutorial/encoder.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

Then, behind the scenes, it would put that JSON-compatible data (e.g. a `dict`) inside of a `JSONResponse` that would be used to send the response to the client.

But you can return a `JSONResponse` directly from your *path operations*.

It might be useful, for example, to return custom headers or cookies.

## Return a `Response`

In fact, you can return any `Response` or any sub-class of it.

/// tip

`JSONResponse` itself is a sub-class of `Response`.

///

And when you return a `Response`, **FastAPI** will pass it directly.

It won't do any data conversion with Pydantic models, it won't convert the contents to any type, etc.

This gives you a lot of flexibility. You can return any data type, override any data declaration or validation, etc.

## Using the `jsonable_encoder` in a `Response`

Because **FastAPI** doesn't make any changes to a `Response` you return, you have to make sure its contents are ready for it.

For example, you cannot put a Pydantic model in a `JSONResponse` without first converting it to a `dict` with all the data types (like `datetime`, `UUID`, etc) converted to JSON-compatible types.

For those cases, you can use the `jsonable_encoder` to convert your data before passing it to a response:

{* ../../docs_src/response_directly/tutorial001.py hl[6:7,21:22] *}

/// note | Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette.responses import JSONResponse`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.responses` as `fastapi.responses` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available responses come directly from Starlette.

///

## Returning a custom `Response`

The example above shows all the parts you need, but it's not very useful yet, as you could have just returned the `item` directly, and **FastAPI** would put it in a `JSONResponse` for you, converting it to a `dict`, etc. All that by default.

Now, let's see how you could use that to return a custom response.

Let's say that you want to return an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML" class="external-link" target="_blank">XML</a> response.

You could put your XML content in a string, put that in a `Response`, and return it:

{* ../../docs_src/response_directly/tutorial002.py hl[1,18] *}

## Notes

When you return a `Response` directly its data is not validated, converted (serialized), or documented automatically.

But you can still document it as described in [Additional Responses in OpenAPI](additional-responses.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

You can see in later sections how to use/declare these custom `Response`s while still having automatic data conversion, documentation, etc.

# Response Headers

## Use a `Response` parameter

You can declare a parameter of type `Response` in your *path operation function* (as you can do for cookies).

And then you can set headers in that *temporal* response object.

{* ../../docs_src/response_headers/tutorial002.py hl[1, 7:8] *}

And then you can return any object you need, as you normally would (a `dict`, a database model, etc).

And if you declared a `response_model`, it will still be used to filter and convert the object you returned.

**FastAPI** will use that *temporal* response to extract the headers (also cookies and status code), and will put them in the final response that contains the value you returned, filtered by any `response_model`.

You can also declare the `Response` parameter in dependencies, and set headers (and cookies) in them.

## Return a `Response` directly

You can also add headers when you return a `Response` directly.

Create a response as described in [Return a Response Directly](response-directly.md){.internal-link target=_blank} and pass the headers as an additional parameter:

{* ../../docs_src/response_headers/tutorial001.py hl[10:12] *}

## Custom Headers

Keep in mind that custom proprietary headers can be added <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers" class="external-link" target="_blank">using the 'X-' prefix</a>.

But if you have custom headers that you want a client in a browser to be able to see, you need to add them to your CORS configurations (read more in [CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)](../tutorial/cors.md){.internal-link target=_blank}), using the parameter `expose_headers` documented in <a href="https://www.starlette.io/middleware/#corsmiddleware" class="external-link" target="_blank">Starlette's CORS docs</a>.

# Settings and Environment Variables

In many cases your application could need some external settings or configurations, for example secret keys, database credentials, credentials for email services, etc.

Most of these settings are variable (can change), like database URLs. And many could be sensitive, like secrets.

For this reason it's common to provide them in environment variables that are read by the application.

/// tip

To understand environment variables you can read [Environment Variables](../environment-variables.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

///

## Types and validation

These environment variables can only handle text strings, as they are external to Python and have to be compatible with other programs and the rest of the system (and even with different operating systems, as Linux, Windows, macOS).

That means that any value read in Python from an environment variable will be a `str`, and any conversion to a different type or any validation has to be done in code.

## Pydantic `Settings`

Fortunately, Pydantic provides a great utility to handle these settings coming from environment variables with <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/pydantic_settings/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic: Settings management</a>.

### Install `pydantic-settings`

First, make sure you create your [virtual environment](../virtual-environments.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, activate it, and then install the `pydantic-settings` package:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install pydantic-settings
---> 100%
```

</div>

It also comes included when you install the `all` extras with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install "fastapi[all]"
---> 100%
```

</div>

/// info

In Pydantic v1 it came included with the main package. Now it is distributed as this independent package so that you can choose to install it or not if you don't need that functionality.

///

### Create the `Settings` object

Import `BaseSettings` from Pydantic and create a sub-class, very much like with a Pydantic model.

The same way as with Pydantic models, you declare class attributes with type annotations, and possibly default values.

You can use all the same validation features and tools you use for Pydantic models, like different data types and additional validations with `Field()`.

//// tab | Pydantic v2

{* ../../docs_src/settings/tutorial001.py hl[2,5:8,11] *}

////

//// tab | Pydantic v1

/// info

In Pydantic v1 you would import `BaseSettings` directly from `pydantic` instead of from `pydantic_settings`.

///

{* ../../docs_src/settings/tutorial001_pv1.py hl[2,5:8,11] *}

////

/// tip

If you want something quick to copy and paste, don't use this example, use the last one below.

///

Then, when you create an instance of that `Settings` class (in this case, in the `settings` object), Pydantic will read the environment variables in a case-insensitive way, so, an upper-case variable `APP_NAME` will still be read for the attribute `app_name`.

Next it will convert and validate the data. So, when you use that `settings` object, you will have data of the types you declared (e.g. `items_per_user` will be an `int`).

### Use the `settings`

Then you can use the new `settings` object in your application:

{* ../../docs_src/settings/tutorial001.py hl[18:20] *}

### Run the server

Next, you would run the server passing the configurations as environment variables, for example you could set an `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `APP_NAME` with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ ADMIN_EMAIL="deadpool@example.com" APP_NAME="ChimichangApp" fastapi run main.py

<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

</div>

/// tip

To set multiple env vars for a single command just separate them with a space, and put them all before the command.

///

And then the `admin_email` setting would be set to `"deadpool@example.com"`.

The `app_name` would be `"ChimichangApp"`.

And the `items_per_user` would keep its default value of `50`.

## Settings in another module

You could put those settings in another module file as you saw in [Bigger Applications - Multiple Files](../tutorial/bigger-applications.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

For example, you could have a file `config.py` with:

{* ../../docs_src/settings/app01/config.py *}

And then use it in a file `main.py`:

{* ../../docs_src/settings/app01/main.py hl[3,11:13] *}

/// tip

You would also need a file `__init__.py` as you saw in [Bigger Applications - Multiple Files](../tutorial/bigger-applications.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

///

## Settings in a dependency

In some occasions it might be useful to provide the settings from a dependency, instead of having a global object with `settings` that is used everywhere.

This could be especially useful during testing, as it's very easy to override a dependency with your own custom settings.

### The config file

Coming from the previous example, your `config.py` file could look like:

{* ../../docs_src/settings/app02/config.py hl[10] *}

Notice that now we don't create a default instance `settings = Settings()`.

### The main app file

Now we create a dependency that returns a new `config.Settings()`.

{* ../../docs_src/settings/app02_an_py39/main.py hl[6,12:13] *}

/// tip

We'll discuss the `@lru_cache` in a bit.

For now you can assume `get_settings()` is a normal function.

///

And then we can require it from the *path operation function* as a dependency and use it anywhere we need it.

{* ../../docs_src/settings/app02_an_py39/main.py hl[17,19:21] *}

### Settings and testing

Then it would be very easy to provide a different settings object during testing by creating a dependency override for `get_settings`:

{* ../../docs_src/settings/app02/test_main.py hl[9:10,13,21] *}

In the dependency override we set a new value for the `admin_email` when creating the new `Settings` object, and then we return that new object.

Then we can test that it is used.

## Reading a `.env` file

If you have many settings that possibly change a lot, maybe in different environments, it might be useful to put them on a file and then read them from it as if they were environment variables.

This practice is common enough that it has a name, these environment variables are commonly placed in a file `.env`, and the file is called a "dotenv".

/// tip

A file starting with a dot (`.`) is a hidden file in Unix-like systems, like Linux and macOS.

But a dotenv file doesn't really have to have that exact filename.

///

Pydantic has support for reading from these types of files using an external library. You can read more at <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/pydantic_settings/#dotenv-env-support" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic Settings: Dotenv (.env) support</a>.

/// tip

For this to work, you need to `pip install python-dotenv`.

///

### The `.env` file

You could have a `.env` file with:

```bash
ADMIN_EMAIL="deadpool@example.com"
APP_NAME="ChimichangApp"
```

### Read settings from `.env`

And then update your `config.py` with:

//// tab | Pydantic v2

{* ../../docs_src/settings/app03_an/config.py hl[9] *}

/// tip

The `model_config` attribute is used just for Pydantic configuration. You can read more at <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/config/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic: Concepts: Configuration</a>.

///

////

//// tab | Pydantic v1

{* ../../docs_src/settings/app03_an/config_pv1.py hl[9:10] *}

/// tip

The `Config` class is used just for Pydantic configuration. You can read more at <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/1.10/usage/model_config/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic Model Config</a>.

///

////

/// info

In Pydantic version 1 the configuration was done in an internal class `Config`, in Pydantic version 2 it's done in an attribute `model_config`. This attribute takes a `dict`, and to get autocompletion and inline errors you can import and use `SettingsConfigDict` to define that `dict`.

///

Here we define the config `env_file` inside of your Pydantic `Settings` class, and set the value to the filename with the dotenv file we want to use.

### Creating the `Settings` only once with `lru_cache`

Reading a file from disk is normally a costly (slow) operation, so you probably want to do it only once and then reuse the same settings object, instead of reading it for each request.

But every time we do:

```Python
Settings()
```

a new `Settings` object would be created, and at creation it would read the `.env` file again.

If the dependency function was just like:

```Python
def get_settings():
    return Settings()
```

we would create that object for each request, and we would be reading the `.env` file for each request. ⚠️

But as we are using the `@lru_cache` decorator on top, the `Settings` object will be created only once, the first time it's called. ✔️

{* ../../docs_src/settings/app03_an_py39/main.py hl[1,11] *}

Then for any subsequent call of `get_settings()` in the dependencies for the next requests, instead of executing the internal code of `get_settings()` and creating a new `Settings` object, it will return the same object that was returned on the first call, again and again.

#### `lru_cache` Technical Details

`@lru_cache` modifies the function it decorates to return the same value that was returned the first time, instead of computing it again, executing the code of the function every time.

So, the function below it will be executed once for each combination of arguments. And then the values returned by each of those combinations of arguments will be used again and again whenever the function is called with exactly the same combination of arguments.

For example, if you have a function:

```Python
@lru_cache
def say_hi(name: str, salutation: str = "Ms."):
    return f"Hello {salutation} {name}"
```

your program could execute like this:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

participant code as Code
participant function as say_hi()
participant execute as Execute function

    rect rgba(0, 255, 0, .1)
        code ->> function: say_hi(name="Camila")
        function ->> execute: execute function code
        execute ->> code: return the result
    end

    rect rgba(0, 255, 255, .1)
        code ->> function: say_hi(name="Camila")
        function ->> code: return stored result
    end

    rect rgba(0, 255, 0, .1)
        code ->> function: say_hi(name="Rick")
        function ->> execute: execute function code
        execute ->> code: return the result
    end

    rect rgba(0, 255, 0, .1)
        code ->> function: say_hi(name="Rick", salutation="Mr.")
        function ->> execute: execute function code
        execute ->> code: return the result
    end

    rect rgba(0, 255, 255, .1)
        code ->> function: say_hi(name="Rick")
        function ->> code: return stored result
    end

    rect rgba(0, 255, 255, .1)
        code ->> function: say_hi(name="Camila")
        function ->> code: return stored result
    end
```

In the case of our dependency `get_settings()`, the function doesn't even take any arguments, so it always returns the same value.

That way, it behaves almost as if it was just a global variable. But as it uses a dependency function, then we can override it easily for testing.

`@lru_cache` is part of `functools` which is part of Python's standard library, you can read more about it in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache" class="external-link" target="_blank">Python docs for `@lru_cache`</a>.

## Recap

You can use Pydantic Settings to handle the settings or configurations for your application, with all the power of Pydantic models.

* By using a dependency you can simplify testing.
* You can use `.env` files with it.
* Using `@lru_cache` lets you avoid reading the dotenv file again and again for each request, while allowing you to override it during testing.

# Sub Applications - Mounts

If you need to have two independent FastAPI applications, with their own independent OpenAPI and their own docs UIs, you can have a main app and "mount" one (or more) sub-application(s).

## Mounting a **FastAPI** application

"Mounting" means adding a completely "independent" application in a specific path, that then takes care of handling everything under that path, with the _path operations_ declared in that sub-application.

### Top-level application

First, create the main, top-level, **FastAPI** application, and its *path operations*:

{* ../../docs_src/sub_applications/tutorial001.py hl[3, 6:8] *}

### Sub-application

Then, create your sub-application, and its *path operations*.

This sub-application is just another standard FastAPI application, but this is the one that will be "mounted":

{* ../../docs_src/sub_applications/tutorial001.py hl[11, 14:16] *}

### Mount the sub-application

In your top-level application, `app`, mount the sub-application, `subapi`.

In this case, it will be mounted at the path `/subapi`:

{* ../../docs_src/sub_applications/tutorial001.py hl[11, 19] *}

### Check the automatic API docs

Now, run the `fastapi` command with your file:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ fastapi dev main.py

<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

And open the docs at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>.

You will see the automatic API docs for the main app, including only its own _path operations_:

<img src="/img/tutorial/sub-applications/image01.png">

And then, open the docs for the sub-application, at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/subapi/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/subapi/docs</a>.

You will see the automatic API docs for the sub-application, including only its own _path operations_, all under the correct sub-path prefix `/subapi`:

<img src="/img/tutorial/sub-applications/image02.png">

If you try interacting with any of the two user interfaces, they will work correctly, because the browser will be able to talk to each specific app or sub-app.

### Technical Details: `root_path`

When you mount a sub-application as described above, FastAPI will take care of communicating the mount path for the sub-application using a mechanism from the ASGI specification called a `root_path`.

That way, the sub-application will know to use that path prefix for the docs UI.

And the sub-application could also have its own mounted sub-applications and everything would work correctly, because FastAPI handles all these `root_path`s automatically.

You will learn more about the `root_path` and how to use it explicitly in the section about [Behind a Proxy](behind-a-proxy.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

## File: docs/en/docs/advanced/templates.md
````markdown
# Templates

You can use any template engine you want with **FastAPI**.

A common choice is Jinja2, the same one used by Flask and other tools.

There are utilities to configure it easily that you can use directly in your **FastAPI** application (provided by Starlette).

## Install dependencies

Make sure you create a [virtual environment](../virtual-environments.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, activate it, and install `jinja2`:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install jinja2

---> 100%
```

</div>

## Using `Jinja2Templates`

* Import `Jinja2Templates`.
* Create a `templates` object that you can reuse later.
* Declare a `Request` parameter in the *path operation* that will return a template.
* Use the `templates` you created to render and return a `TemplateResponse`, pass the name of the template, the request object, and a "context" dictionary with key-value pairs to be used inside of the Jinja2 template.

{* ../../docs_src/templates/tutorial001.py hl[4,11,15:18] *}

/// note

Before FastAPI 0.108.0, Starlette 0.29.0, the `name` was the first parameter.

Also, before that, in previous versions, the `request` object was passed as part of the key-value pairs in the context for Jinja2.

///

/// tip

By declaring `response_class=HTMLResponse` the docs UI will be able to know that the response will be HTML.

///

/// note | Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette.templating import Jinja2Templates`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.templating` as `fastapi.templating` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available responses come directly from Starlette. The same with `Request` and `StaticFiles`.

///

## Writing templates

Then you can write a template at `templates/item.html` with, for example:

```jinja hl_lines="7"
{!../../docs_src/templates/templates/item.html!}
```

### Template Context Values

In the HTML that contains:

{% raw %}

```jinja
Item ID: {{ id }}
```

{% endraw %}

...it will show the `id` taken from the "context" `dict` you passed:

```Python
{"id": id}
```

For example, with an ID of `42`, this would render:

```html
Item ID: 42
```

### Template `url_for` Arguments

You can also use `url_for()` inside of the template, it takes as arguments the same arguments that would be used by your *path operation function*.

So, the section with:

{% raw %}

```jinja
<a href="{{ url_for('read_item', id=id) }}">
```

{% endraw %}

...will generate a link to the same URL that would be handled by the *path operation function* `read_item(id=id)`.

For example, with an ID of `42`, this would render:

```html
<a href="/items/42">
```

## Templates and static files

You can also use `url_for()` inside of the template, and use it, for example, with the `StaticFiles` you mounted with the `name="static"`.

```jinja hl_lines="4"
{!../../docs_src/templates/templates/item.html!}
```

In this example, it would link to a CSS file at `static/styles.css` with:

```CSS hl_lines="4"
{!../../docs_src/templates/static/styles.css!}
```

And because you are using `StaticFiles`, that CSS file would be served automatically by your **FastAPI** application at the URL `/static/styles.css`.

# Testing Dependencies with Overrides

## Overriding dependencies during testing

There are some scenarios where you might want to override a dependency during testing.

You don't want the original dependency to run (nor any of the sub-dependencies it might have).

Instead, you want to provide a different dependency that will be used only during tests (possibly only some specific tests), and will provide a value that can be used where the value of the original dependency was used.

### Use cases: external service

An example could be that you have an external authentication provider that you need to call.

You send it a token and it returns an authenticated user.

This provider might be charging you per request, and calling it might take some extra time than if you had a fixed mock user for tests.

You probably want to test the external provider once, but not necessarily call it for every test that runs.

In this case, you can override the dependency that calls that provider, and use a custom dependency that returns a mock user, only for your tests.

### Use the `app.dependency_overrides` attribute

For these cases, your **FastAPI** application has an attribute `app.dependency_overrides`, it is a simple `dict`.

To override a dependency for testing, you put as a key the original dependency (a function), and as the value, your dependency override (another function).

And then **FastAPI** will call that override instead of the original dependency.

{* ../../docs_src/dependency_testing/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[26:27,30] *}

/// tip

You can set a dependency override for a dependency used anywhere in your **FastAPI** application.

The original dependency could be used in a *path operation function*, a *path operation decorator* (when you don't use the return value), a `.include_router()` call, etc.

FastAPI will still be able to override it.

///

Then you can reset your overrides (remove them) by setting `app.dependency_overrides` to be an empty `dict`:

```Python
app.dependency_overrides = {}
```

/// tip

If you want to override a dependency only during some tests, you can set the override at the beginning of the test (inside the test function) and reset it at the end (at the end of the test function).

## File: docs/en/docs/advanced/using-request-directly.md
````markdown
# Using the Request Directly

Up to now, you have been declaring the parts of the request that you need with their types.

Taking data from:

* The path as parameters.
* Headers.
* Cookies.
* etc.

And by doing so, **FastAPI** is validating that data, converting it and generating documentation for your API automatically.

But there are situations where you might need to access the `Request` object directly.

## Details about the `Request` object

As **FastAPI** is actually **Starlette** underneath, with a layer of several tools on top, you can use Starlette's <a href="https://www.starlette.io/requests/" class="external-link" target="_blank">`Request`</a> object directly when you need to.

It would also mean that if you get data from the `Request` object directly (for example, read the body) it won't be validated, converted or documented (with OpenAPI, for the automatic API user interface) by FastAPI.

Although any other parameter declared normally (for example, the body with a Pydantic model) would still be validated, converted, annotated, etc.

But there are specific cases where it's useful to get the `Request` object.

## Use the `Request` object directly

Let's imagine you want to get the client's IP address/host inside of your *path operation function*.

For that you need to access the request directly.

{* ../../docs_src/using_request_directly/tutorial001.py hl[1,7:8] *}

By declaring a *path operation function* parameter with the type being the `Request` **FastAPI** will know to pass the `Request` in that parameter.

/// tip

Note that in this case, we are declaring a path parameter beside the request parameter.

So, the path parameter will be extracted, validated, converted to the specified type and annotated with OpenAPI.

The same way, you can declare any other parameter as normally, and additionally, get the `Request` too.

///

## `Request` documentation

You can read more details about the <a href="https://www.starlette.io/requests/" class="external-link" target="_blank">`Request` object in the official Starlette documentation site</a>.

/// note | Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette.requests import Request`.

**FastAPI** provides it directly just as a convenience for you, the developer. But it comes directly from Starlette.

# WebSockets

You can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API" class="external-link" target="_blank">WebSockets</a> with **FastAPI**.

## Install `WebSockets`

Make sure you create a [virtual environment](../virtual-environments.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, activate it, and install `websockets`:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install websockets

---> 100%
```

</div>

## WebSockets client

### In production

In your production system, you probably have a frontend created with a modern framework like React, Vue.js or Angular.

And to communicate using WebSockets with your backend you would probably use your frontend's utilities.

Or you might have a native mobile application that communicates with your WebSocket backend directly, in native code.

Or you might have any other way to communicate with the WebSocket endpoint.

---

But for this example, we'll use a very simple HTML document with some JavaScript, all inside a long string.

This, of course, is not optimal and you wouldn't use it for production.

In production you would have one of the options above.

But it's the simplest way to focus on the server-side of WebSockets and have a working example:

{* ../../docs_src/websockets/tutorial001.py hl[2,6:38,41:43] *}

## Create a `websocket`

In your **FastAPI** application, create a `websocket`:

{* ../../docs_src/websockets/tutorial001.py hl[1,46:47] *}

/// note | Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette.websockets import WebSocket`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `WebSocket` directly just as a convenience for you, the developer. But it comes directly from Starlette.

///

## Await for messages and send messages

In your WebSocket route you can `await` for messages and send messages.

{* ../../docs_src/websockets/tutorial001.py hl[48:52] *}

You can receive and send binary, text, and JSON data.

## Try it

If your file is named `main.py`, run your application with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ fastapi dev main.py

<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

</div>

Open your browser at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000</a>.

You will see a simple page like:

<img src="/img/tutorial/websockets/image01.png">

You can type messages in the input box, and send them:

<img src="/img/tutorial/websockets/image02.png">

And your **FastAPI** application with WebSockets will respond back:

<img src="/img/tutorial/websockets/image03.png">

You can send (and receive) many messages:

<img src="/img/tutorial/websockets/image04.png">

And all of them will use the same WebSocket connection.

## Using `Depends` and others

In WebSocket endpoints you can import from `fastapi` and use:

* `Depends`
* `Security`
* `Cookie`
* `Header`
* `Path`
* `Query`

They work the same way as for other FastAPI endpoints/*path operations*:

{* ../../docs_src/websockets/tutorial002_an_py310.py hl[68:69,82] *}

/// info

As this is a WebSocket it doesn't really make sense to raise an `HTTPException`, instead we raise a `WebSocketException`.

You can use a closing code from the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1" class="external-link" target="_blank">valid codes defined in the specification</a>.

///

### Try the WebSockets with dependencies

If your file is named `main.py`, run your application with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ fastapi dev main.py

<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

</div>

Open your browser at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000</a>.

There you can set:

* The "Item ID", used in the path.
* The "Token" used as a query parameter.

/// tip

Notice that the query `token` will be handled by a dependency.

///

With that you can connect the WebSocket and then send and receive messages:

<img src="/img/tutorial/websockets/image05.png">

## Handling disconnections and multiple clients

When a WebSocket connection is closed, the `await websocket.receive_text()` will raise a `WebSocketDisconnect` exception, which you can then catch and handle like in this example.

{* ../../docs_src/websockets/tutorial003_py39.py hl[79:81] *}

To try it out:

* Open the app with several browser tabs.
* Write messages from them.
* Then close one of the tabs.

That will raise the `WebSocketDisconnect` exception, and all the other clients will receive a message like:

```
Client #1596980209979 left the chat
```

/// tip

The app above is a minimal and simple example to demonstrate how to handle and broadcast messages to several WebSocket connections.

But keep in mind that, as everything is handled in memory, in a single list, it will only work while the process is running, and will only work with a single process.

If you need something easy to integrate with FastAPI but that is more robust, supported by Redis, PostgreSQL or others, check <a href="https://github.com/encode/broadcaster" class="external-link" target="_blank">encode/broadcaster</a>.

# Including WSGI - Flask, Django, others

You can mount WSGI applications as you saw with [Sub Applications - Mounts](sub-applications.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, [Behind a Proxy](behind-a-proxy.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

For that, you can use the `WSGIMiddleware` and use it to wrap your WSGI application, for example, Flask, Django, etc.

## Using `WSGIMiddleware`

You need to import `WSGIMiddleware`.

Then wrap the WSGI (e.g. Flask) app with the middleware.

And then mount that under a path.

Now, every request under the path `/v1/` will be handled by the Flask application.

And the rest will be handled by **FastAPI**.

If you run it and go to <a href="http://localhost:8000/v1/" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://localhost:8000/v1/</a> you will see the response from Flask:

## Cloud Providers - Sponsors

Some cloud providers ✨ [**sponsor FastAPI**](../help-fastapi.md#sponsor-the-author){.internal-link target=_blank} ✨, this ensures the continued and healthy **development** of FastAPI and its **ecosystem**.

# Deployments Concepts

When deploying a **FastAPI** application, or actually, any type of web API, there are several concepts that you probably care about, and using them you can find the **most appropriate** way to **deploy your application**.

Some of the important concepts are:

* Security - HTTPS
* Running on startup
* Restarts
* Replication (the number of processes running)
* Memory
* Previous steps before starting

We'll see how they would affect **deployments**.

In the end, the ultimate objective is to be able to **serve your API clients** in a way that is **secure**, to **avoid disruptions**, and to use the **compute resources** (for example remote servers/virtual machines) as efficiently as possible. 🚀

I'll tell you a bit more about these **concepts** here, and that would hopefully give you the **intuition** you would need to decide how to deploy your API in very different environments, possibly even in **future** ones that don't exist yet.

By considering these concepts, you will be able to **evaluate and design** the best way to deploy **your own APIs**.

In the next chapters, I'll give you more **concrete recipes** to deploy FastAPI applications.

But for now, let's check these important **conceptual ideas**. These concepts also apply to any other type of web API. 💡

## Security - HTTPS

In the [previous chapter about HTTPS](https.md){.internal-link target=_blank} we learned about how HTTPS provides encryption for your API.

We also saw that HTTPS is normally provided by a component **external** to your application server, a **TLS Termination Proxy**.

And there has to be something in charge of **renewing the HTTPS certificates**, it could be the same component or it could be something different.

### Example Tools for HTTPS

Some of the tools you could use as a TLS Termination Proxy are:

* Traefik
    * Automatically handles certificates renewals ✨
* Caddy
    * Automatically handles certificates renewals ✨
* Nginx
    * With an external component like Certbot for certificate renewals
* HAProxy
    * With an external component like Certbot for certificate renewals
* Kubernetes with an Ingress Controller like Nginx
    * With an external component like cert-manager for certificate renewals
* Handled internally by a cloud provider as part of their services (read below 👇)

Another option is that you could use a **cloud service** that does more of the work including setting up HTTPS. It could have some restrictions or charge you more, etc. But in that case, you wouldn't have to set up a TLS Termination Proxy yourself.

I'll show you some concrete examples in the next chapters.

---

Then the next concepts to consider are all about the program running your actual API (e.g. Uvicorn).

## Program and Process

We will talk a lot about the running "**process**", so it's useful to have clarity about what it means, and what's the difference with the word "**program**".

### What is a Program

The word **program** is commonly used to describe many things:

* The **code** that you write, the **Python files**.
* The **file** that can be **executed** by the operating system, for example: `python`, `python.exe` or `uvicorn`.
* A particular program while it is **running** on the operating system, using the CPU, and storing things in memory. This is also called a **process**.

### What is a Process

The word **process** is normally used in a more specific way, only referring to the thing that is running in the operating system (like in the last point above):

* A particular program while it is **running** on the operating system.
    * This doesn't refer to the file, nor to the code, it refers **specifically** to the thing that is being **executed** and managed by the operating system.
* Any program, any code, **can only do things** when it is being **executed**. So, when there's a **process running**.
* The process can be **terminated** (or "killed") by you, or by the operating system. At that point, it stops running/being executed, and it can **no longer do things**.
* Each application that you have running on your computer has some process behind it, each running program, each window, etc. And there are normally many processes running **at the same time** while a computer is on.
* There can be **multiple processes** of the **same program** running at the same time.

If you check out the "task manager" or "system monitor" (or similar tools) in your operating system, you will be able to see many of those processes running.

And, for example, you will probably see that there are multiple processes running the same browser program (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, etc). They normally run one process per tab, plus some other extra processes.

<img class="shadow" src="/img/deployment/concepts/image01.png">

---

Now that we know the difference between the terms **process** and **program**, let's continue talking about deployments.

## Running on Startup

In most cases, when you create a web API, you want it to be **always running**, uninterrupted, so that your clients can always access it. This is of course, unless you have a specific reason why you want it to run only in certain situations, but most of the time you want it constantly running and **available**.

### In a Remote Server

When you set up a remote server (a cloud server, a virtual machine, etc.) the simplest thing you can do is use `fastapi run` (which uses Uvicorn) or something  similar, manually, the same way you do when developing locally.

And it will work and will be useful **during development**.

But if your connection to the server is lost, the **running process** will probably die.

And if the server is restarted (for example after updates, or migrations from the cloud provider) you probably **won't notice it**. And because of that, you won't even know that you have to restart the process manually. So, your API will just stay dead. 😱

### Run Automatically on Startup

In general, you will probably want the server program (e.g. Uvicorn) to be started automatically on server startup, and without needing any **human intervention**, to have a process always running with your API (e.g. Uvicorn running your FastAPI app).

### Separate Program

To achieve this, you will normally have a **separate program** that would make sure your application is run on startup. And in many cases, it would also make sure other components or applications are also run, for example, a database.

### Example Tools to Run at Startup

Some examples of the tools that can do this job are:

* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Docker Compose
* Docker in Swarm Mode
* Systemd
* Supervisor
* Handled internally by a cloud provider as part of their services
* Others...

I'll give you more concrete examples in the next chapters.

## Restarts

Similar to making sure your application is run on startup, you probably also want to make sure it is **restarted** after failures.

### We Make Mistakes

We, as humans, make **mistakes**, all the time. Software almost *always* has **bugs** hidden in different places. 🐛

And we as developers keep improving the code as we find those bugs and as we implement new features (possibly adding new bugs too 😅).

### Small Errors Automatically Handled

When building web APIs with FastAPI, if there's an error in our code, FastAPI will normally contain it to the single request that triggered the error. 🛡

The client will get a **500 Internal Server Error** for that request, but the application will continue working for the next requests instead of just crashing completely.

### Bigger Errors - Crashes

Nevertheless, there might be cases where we write some code that **crashes the entire application** making Uvicorn and Python crash. 💥

And still, you would probably not want the application to stay dead because there was an error in one place, you probably want it to **continue running** at least for the *path operations* that are not broken.

### Restart After Crash

But in those cases with really bad errors that crash the running **process**, you would want an external component that is in charge of **restarting** the process, at least a couple of times...

/// tip

...Although if the whole application is just **crashing immediately** it probably doesn't make sense to keep restarting it forever. But in those cases, you will probably notice it during development, or at least right after deployment.

So let's focus on the main cases, where it could crash entirely in some particular cases **in the future**, and it still makes sense to restart it.

///

You would probably want to have the thing in charge of restarting your application as an **external component**, because by that point, the same application with Uvicorn and Python already crashed, so there's nothing in the same code of the same app that could do anything about it.

### Example Tools to Restart Automatically

In most cases, the same tool that is used to **run the program on startup** is also used to handle automatic **restarts**.

For example, this could be handled by:

* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Docker Compose
* Docker in Swarm Mode
* Systemd
* Supervisor
* Handled internally by a cloud provider as part of their services
* Others...

## Replication - Processes and Memory

With a FastAPI application, using a server program like the `fastapi` command that runs Uvicorn, running it once in **one process** can serve multiple clients concurrently.

But in many cases, you will want to run several worker processes at the same time.

### Multiple Processes - Workers

If you have more clients than what a single process can handle (for example if the virtual machine is not too big) and you have **multiple cores** in the server's CPU, then you could have **multiple processes** running with the same application at the same time, and distribute all the requests among them.

When you run **multiple processes** of the same API program, they are commonly called **workers**.

### Worker Processes and Ports

Remember from the docs [About HTTPS](https.md){.internal-link target=_blank} that only one process can be listening on one combination of port and IP address in a server?

This is still true.

So, to be able to have **multiple processes** at the same time, there has to be a **single process listening on a port** that then transmits the communication to each worker process in some way.

### Memory per Process

Now, when the program loads things in memory, for example, a machine learning model in a variable, or the contents of a large file in a variable, all that **consumes a bit of the memory (RAM)** of the server.

And multiple processes normally **don't share any memory**. This means that each running process has its own things, variables, and memory. And if you are consuming a large amount of memory in your code, **each process** will consume an equivalent amount of memory.

### Server Memory

For example, if your code loads a Machine Learning model with **1 GB in size**, when you run one process with your API, it will consume at least 1 GB of RAM. And if you start **4 processes** (4 workers), each will consume 1 GB of RAM. So in total, your API will consume **4 GB of RAM**.

And if your remote server or virtual machine only has 3 GB of RAM, trying to load more than 4 GB of RAM will cause problems. 🚨

### Multiple Processes - An Example

In this example, there's a **Manager Process** that starts and controls two **Worker Processes**.

This Manager Process would probably be the one listening on the **port** in the IP. And it would transmit all the communication to the worker processes.

Those worker processes would be the ones running your application, they would perform the main computations to receive a **request** and return a **response**, and they would load anything you put in variables in RAM.

<img src="/img/deployment/concepts/process-ram.drawio.svg">

And of course, the same machine would probably have **other processes** running as well, apart from your application.

An interesting detail is that the percentage of the **CPU used** by each process can **vary** a lot over time, but the **memory (RAM)** normally stays more or less **stable**.

If you have an API that does a comparable amount of computations every time and you have a lot of clients, then the **CPU utilization** will probably *also be stable* (instead of constantly going up and down quickly).

### Examples of Replication Tools and Strategies

There can be several approaches to achieve this, and I'll tell you more about specific strategies in the next chapters, for example when talking about Docker and containers.

The main constraint to consider is that there has to be a **single** component handling the **port** in the **public IP**. And then it has to have a way to **transmit** the communication to the replicated **processes/workers**.

Here are some possible combinations and strategies:

* **Uvicorn** with `--workers`
    * One Uvicorn **process manager** would listen on the **IP** and **port**, and it would start **multiple Uvicorn worker processes**.
* **Kubernetes** and other distributed **container systems**
    * Something in the **Kubernetes** layer would listen on the **IP** and **port**. The replication would be by having **multiple containers**, each with **one Uvicorn process** running.
* **Cloud services** that handle this for you
    * The cloud service will probably **handle replication for you**. It would possibly let you define **a process to run**, or a **container image** to use, in any case, it would most probably be **a single Uvicorn process**, and the cloud service would be in charge of replicating it.

/// tip

Don't worry if some of these items about **containers**, Docker, or Kubernetes don't make a lot of sense yet.

I'll tell you more about container images, Docker, Kubernetes, etc. in a future chapter: [FastAPI in Containers - Docker](docker.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

///

## Previous Steps Before Starting

There are many cases where you want to perform some steps **before starting** your application.

For example, you might want to run **database migrations**.

But in most cases, you will want to perform these steps only **once**.

So, you will want to have a **single process** to perform those **previous steps**, before starting the application.

And you will have to make sure that it's a single process running those previous steps *even* if afterwards, you start **multiple processes** (multiple workers) for the application itself. If those steps were run by **multiple processes**, they would **duplicate** the work by running it in **parallel**, and if the steps were something delicate like a database migration, they could cause conflicts with each other.

Of course, there are some cases where there's no problem in running the previous steps multiple times, in that case, it's a lot easier to handle.

/// tip

Also, keep in mind that depending on your setup, in some cases you **might not even need any previous steps** before starting your application.

In that case, you wouldn't have to worry about any of this. 🤷

///

### Examples of Previous Steps Strategies

This will **depend heavily** on the way you **deploy your system**, and it would probably be connected to the way you start programs, handling restarts, etc.

Here are some possible ideas:

* An "Init Container" in Kubernetes that runs before your app container
* A bash script that runs the previous steps and then starts your application
    * You would still need a way to start/restart *that* bash script, detect errors, etc.

/// tip

I'll give you more concrete examples for doing this with containers in a future chapter: [FastAPI in Containers - Docker](docker.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

///

## Resource Utilization

Your server(s) is (are) a **resource**, you can consume or **utilize**, with your programs, the computation time on the CPUs, and the RAM memory available.

How much of the system resources do you want to be consuming/utilizing? It might be easy to think "not much", but in reality, you will probably want to consume **as much as possible without crashing**.

If you are paying for 3 servers but you are using only a little bit of their RAM and CPU, you are probably **wasting money** 💸, and probably **wasting server electric power** 🌎, etc.

In that case, it could be better to have only 2 servers and use a higher percentage of their resources (CPU, memory, disk, network bandwidth, etc).

On the other hand, if you have 2 servers and you are using **100% of their CPU and RAM**, at some point one process will ask for more memory, and the server will have to use the disk as "memory" (which can be thousands of times slower), or even **crash**. Or one process might need to do some computation and would have to wait until the CPU is free again.

In this case, it would be better to get **one extra server** and run some processes on it so that they all have **enough RAM and CPU time**.

There's also the chance that for some reason you have a **spike** of usage of your API. Maybe it went viral, or maybe some other services or bots start using it. And you might want to have extra resources to be safe in those cases.

You could put an **arbitrary number** to target, for example, something **between 50% to 90%** of resource utilization. The point is that those are probably the main things you will want to measure and use to tweak your deployments.

You can use simple tools like `htop` to see the CPU and RAM used in your server or the amount used by each process. Or you can use more complex monitoring tools, which may be distributed across servers, etc.

## Recap

You have been reading here some of the main concepts that you would probably need to keep in mind when deciding how to deploy your application:

* Security - HTTPS
* Running on startup
* Restarts
* Replication (the number of processes running)
* Memory
* Previous steps before starting

Understanding these ideas and how to apply them should give you the intuition necessary to take any decisions when configuring and tweaking your deployments. 🤓

In the next sections, I'll give you more concrete examples of possible strategies you can follow. 🚀

# FastAPI in Containers - Docker

When deploying FastAPI applications a common approach is to build a **Linux container image**. It's normally done using <a href="https://www.docker.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">**Docker**</a>. You can then deploy that container image in one of a few possible ways.

Using Linux containers has several advantages including **security**, **replicability**, **simplicity**, and others.

/// tip

In a hurry and already know this stuff? Jump to the [`Dockerfile` below 👇](#build-a-docker-image-for-fastapi).

///

<details>
<summary>Dockerfile Preview 👀</summary>

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /code

COPY ./requirements.txt /code/requirements.txt

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /code/requirements.txt

COPY ./app /code/app

CMD ["fastapi", "run", "app/main.py", "--port", "80"]

# If running behind a proxy like Nginx or Traefik add --proxy-headers
# CMD ["fastapi", "run", "app/main.py", "--port", "80", "--proxy-headers"]
```

</details>

## What is a Container

Containers (mainly Linux containers) are a very **lightweight** way to package applications including all their dependencies and necessary files while keeping them isolated from other containers (other applications or components) in the same system.

Linux containers run using the same Linux kernel of the host (machine, virtual machine, cloud server, etc). This just means that they are very lightweight (compared to full virtual machines emulating an entire operating system).

This way, containers consume **little resources**, an amount comparable to running the processes directly (a virtual machine would consume much more).

Containers also have their own **isolated** running processes (commonly just one process), file system, and network, simplifying deployment, security, development, etc.

## What is a Container Image

A **container** is run from a **container image**.

A container image is a **static** version of all the files, environment variables, and the default command/program that should be present in a container. **Static** here means that the container **image** is not running, it's not being executed, it's only the packaged files and metadata.

In contrast to a "**container image**" that is the stored static contents, a "**container**" normally refers to the running instance, the thing that is being **executed**.

When the **container** is started and running (started from a **container image**) it could create or change files, environment variables, etc. Those changes will exist only in that container, but would not persist in the underlying container image (would not be saved to disk).

A container image is comparable to the **program** file and contents, e.g. `python` and some file `main.py`.

And the **container** itself (in contrast to the **container image**) is the actual running instance of the image, comparable to a **process**. In fact, a container is running only when it has a **process running** (and normally it's only a single process). The container stops when there's no process running in it.

## Container Images

Docker has been one of the main tools to create and manage **container images** and **containers**.

And there's a public <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a> with pre-made **official container images** for many tools, environments, databases, and applications.

For example, there's an official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/python" class="external-link" target="_blank">Python Image</a>.

And there are many other images for different things like databases, for example for:

* <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres" class="external-link" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>
* <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql" class="external-link" target="_blank">MySQL</a>
* <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo" class="external-link" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>
* <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/redis" class="external-link" target="_blank">Redis</a>, etc.

By using a pre-made container image it's very easy to **combine** and use different tools. For example, to try out a new database. In most cases, you can use the **official images**, and just configure them with environment variables.

That way, in many cases you can learn about containers and Docker and reuse that knowledge with many different tools and components.

So, you would run **multiple containers** with different things, like a database, a Python application, a web server with a React frontend application, and connect them together via their internal network.

All the container management systems (like Docker or Kubernetes) have these networking features integrated into them.

## Containers and Processes

A **container image** normally includes in its metadata the default program or command that should be run when the **container** is started and the parameters to be passed to that program. Very similar to what would be if it was in the command line.

When a **container** is started, it will run that command/program (although you can override it and make it run a different command/program).

A container is running as long as the **main process** (command or program) is running.

A container normally has a **single process**, but it's also possible to start subprocesses from the main process, and that way you will have **multiple processes** in the same container.

But it's not possible to have a running container without **at least one running process**. If the main process stops, the container stops.

## Build a Docker Image for FastAPI

Okay, let's build something now! 🚀

I'll show you how to build a **Docker image** for FastAPI **from scratch**, based on the **official Python** image.

This is what you would want to do in **most cases**, for example:

* Using **Kubernetes** or similar tools
* When running on a **Raspberry Pi**
* Using a cloud service that would run a container image for you, etc.

### Package Requirements

You would normally have the **package requirements** for your application in some file.

It would depend mainly on the tool you use to **install** those requirements.

The most common way to do it is to have a file `requirements.txt` with the package names and their versions, one per line.

You would of course use the same ideas you read in [About FastAPI versions](versions.md){.internal-link target=_blank} to set the ranges of versions.

For example, your `requirements.txt` could look like:

```
fastapi[standard]>=0.113.0,<0.114.0
pydantic>=2.7.0,<3.0.0
```

And you would normally install those package dependencies with `pip`, for example:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
---> 100%
Successfully installed fastapi pydantic
```

</div>

/// info

There are other formats and tools to define and install package dependencies.

///

### Create the **FastAPI** Code

* Create an `app` directory and enter it.
* Create an empty file `__init__.py`.
* Create a `main.py` file with:

```Python
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

### Dockerfile

Now in the same project directory create a file `Dockerfile` with:

```{ .dockerfile .annotate }
# (1)!
FROM python:3.9

# (2)!
WORKDIR /code

# (3)!
COPY ./requirements.txt /code/requirements.txt

# (4)!
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /code/requirements.txt

# (5)!
COPY ./app /code/app

# (6)!
CMD ["fastapi", "run", "app/main.py", "--port", "80"]
```

1. Start from the official Python base image.

2. Set the current working directory to `/code`.

    This is where we'll put the `requirements.txt` file and the `app` directory.

3. Copy the file with the requirements to the `/code` directory.

    Copy **only** the file with the requirements first, not the rest of the code.

    As this file **doesn't change often**, Docker will detect it and use the **cache** for this step, enabling the cache for the next step too.

4. Install the package dependencies in the requirements file.

    The `--no-cache-dir` option tells `pip` to not save the downloaded packages locally, as that is only if `pip` was going to be run again to install the same packages, but that's not the case when working with containers.

    /// note

    The `--no-cache-dir` is only related to `pip`, it has nothing to do with Docker or containers.

    ///

    The `--upgrade` option tells `pip` to upgrade the packages if they are already installed.

    Because the previous step copying the file could be detected by the **Docker cache**, this step will also **use the Docker cache** when available.

    Using the cache in this step will **save** you a lot of **time** when building the image again and again during development, instead of **downloading and installing** all the dependencies **every time**.

5. Copy the `./app` directory inside the `/code` directory.

    As this has all the code which is what **changes most frequently** the Docker **cache** won't be used for this or any **following steps** easily.

    So, it's important to put this **near the end** of the `Dockerfile`, to optimize the container image build times.

6. Set the **command** to use `fastapi run`, which uses Uvicorn underneath.

    `CMD` takes a list of strings, each of these strings is what you would type in the command line separated by spaces.

    This command will be run from the **current working directory**, the same `/code` directory you set above with `WORKDIR /code`.

/// tip

Review what each line does by clicking each number bubble in the code. 👆

///

/// warning

Make sure to **always** use the **exec form** of the `CMD` instruction, as explained below.

///

#### Use `CMD` - Exec Form

The <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#cmd" class="external-link" target="_blank">`CMD`</a> Docker instruction can be written using two forms:

✅ **Exec** form:

```Dockerfile
# ✅ Do this
CMD ["fastapi", "run", "app/main.py", "--port", "80"]
```

⛔️ **Shell** form:

```Dockerfile
# ⛔️ Don't do this
CMD fastapi run app/main.py --port 80
```

Make sure to always use the **exec** form to ensure that FastAPI can shutdown gracefully and [lifespan events](../advanced/events.md){.internal-link target=_blank} are triggered.

You can read more about it in the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#shell-and-exec-form" class="external-link" target="_blank">Docker docs for shell and exec form</a>.

This can be quite noticeable when using `docker compose`. See this Docker Compose FAQ section for more technical details: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/faq/#why-do-my-services-take-10-seconds-to-recreate-or-stop" class="external-link" target="_blank">Why do my services take 10 seconds to recreate or stop?</a>.

#### Directory Structure

You should now have a directory structure like:

```
.
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── main.py
├── Dockerfile
└── requirements.txt
```

#### Behind a TLS Termination Proxy

If you are running your container behind a TLS Termination Proxy (load balancer) like Nginx or Traefik, add the option `--proxy-headers`, this will tell Uvicorn (through the FastAPI CLI) to trust the headers sent by that proxy telling it that the application is running behind HTTPS, etc.

```Dockerfile
CMD ["fastapi", "run", "app/main.py", "--proxy-headers", "--port", "80"]
```

#### Docker Cache

There's an important trick in this `Dockerfile`, we first copy the **file with the dependencies alone**, not the rest of the code. Let me tell you why is that.

```Dockerfile
COPY ./requirements.txt /code/requirements.txt
```

Docker and other tools **build** these container images **incrementally**, adding **one layer on top of the other**, starting from the top of the `Dockerfile` and adding any files created by each of the instructions of the `Dockerfile`.

Docker and similar tools also use an **internal cache** when building the image, if a file hasn't changed since the last time building the container image, then it will **reuse the same layer** created the last time, instead of copying the file again and creating a new layer from scratch.

Just avoiding the copy of files doesn't necessarily improve things too much, but because it used the cache for that step, it can **use the cache for the next step**. For example, it could use the cache for the instruction that installs dependencies with:

```Dockerfile
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /code/requirements.txt
```

The file with the package requirements **won't change frequently**. So, by copying only that file, Docker will be able to **use the cache** for that step.

And then, Docker will be able to **use the cache for the next step** that downloads and install those dependencies. And here's where we **save a lot of time**. ✨ ...and avoid boredom waiting. 😪😆

Downloading and installing the package dependencies **could take minutes**, but using the **cache** would **take seconds** at most.

And as you would be building the container image again and again during development to check that your code changes are working, there's a lot of accumulated time this would save.

Then, near the end of the `Dockerfile`, we copy all the code. As this is what **changes most frequently**, we put it near the end, because almost always, anything after this step will not be able to use the cache.

```Dockerfile
COPY ./app /code/app
```

### Build the Docker Image

Now that all the files are in place, let's build the container image.

* Go to the project directory (in where your `Dockerfile` is, containing your `app` directory).
* Build your FastAPI image:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ docker build -t myimage .

---> 100%
```

</div>

/// tip

Notice the `.` at the end, it's equivalent to `./`, it tells Docker the directory to use to build the container image.

In this case, it's the same current directory (`.`).

///

### Start the Docker Container

* Run a container based on your image:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ docker run -d --name mycontainer -p 80:80 myimage
```

</div>

## Check it

You should be able to check it in your Docker container's URL, for example: <a href="http://192.168.99.100/items/5?q=somequery" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://192.168.99.100/items/5?q=somequery</a> or <a href="http://127.0.0.1/items/5?q=somequery" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1/items/5?q=somequery</a> (or equivalent, using your Docker host).

You will see something like:

```JSON
{"item_id": 5, "q": "somequery"}
```

## Interactive API docs

Now you can go to <a href="http://192.168.99.100/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://192.168.99.100/docs</a> or <a href="http://127.0.0.1/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1/docs</a> (or equivalent, using your Docker host).

You will see the automatic interactive API documentation (provided by <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui" class="external-link" target="_blank">Swagger UI</a>):

![Swagger UI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-01-swagger-ui-simple.png)

## Alternative API docs

And you can also go to <a href="http://192.168.99.100/redoc" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://192.168.99.100/redoc</a> or <a href="http://127.0.0.1/redoc" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1/redoc</a> (or equivalent, using your Docker host).

You will see the alternative automatic documentation (provided by <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc" class="external-link" target="_blank">ReDoc</a>):

![ReDoc](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-02-redoc-simple.png)

## Build a Docker Image with a Single-File FastAPI

If your FastAPI is a single file, for example, `main.py` without an `./app` directory, your file structure could look like this:

```
.
├── Dockerfile
├── main.py
└── requirements.txt
```

Then you would just have to change the corresponding paths to copy the file inside the `Dockerfile`:

```{ .dockerfile .annotate hl_lines="10  13" }
FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /code

COPY ./requirements.txt /code/requirements.txt

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /code/requirements.txt

# (1)!
COPY ./main.py /code/

# (2)!
CMD ["fastapi", "run", "main.py", "--port", "80"]
```

1. Copy the `main.py` file to the `/code` directory directly (without any `./app` directory).

2. Use `fastapi run` to serve your application in the single file `main.py`.

When you pass the file to `fastapi run` it will detect automatically that it is a single file and not part of a package and will know how to import it and serve your FastAPI app. 😎

## Deployment Concepts

Let's talk again about some of the same [Deployment Concepts](concepts.md){.internal-link target=_blank} in terms of containers.

Containers are mainly a tool to simplify the process of **building and deploying** an application, but they don't enforce a particular approach to handle these **deployment concepts**, and there are several possible strategies.

The **good news** is that with each different strategy there's a way to cover all of the deployment concepts. 🎉

Let's review these **deployment concepts** in terms of containers:

* HTTPS
* Running on startup
* Restarts
* Replication (the number of processes running)
* Memory
* Previous steps before starting

## HTTPS

If we focus just on the **container image** for a FastAPI application (and later the running **container**), HTTPS normally would be handled **externally** by another tool.

It could be another container, for example with <a href="https://traefik.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Traefik</a>, handling **HTTPS** and **automatic** acquisition of **certificates**.

/// tip

Traefik has integrations with Docker, Kubernetes, and others, so it's very easy to set up and configure HTTPS for your containers with it.

///

Alternatively, HTTPS could be handled by a cloud provider as one of their services (while still running the application in a container).

## Running on Startup and Restarts

There is normally another tool in charge of **starting and running** your container.

It could be **Docker** directly, **Docker Compose**, **Kubernetes**, a **cloud service**, etc.

In most (or all) cases, there's a simple option to enable running the container on startup and enabling restarts on failures. For example, in Docker, it's the command line option `--restart`.

Without using containers, making applications run on startup and with restarts can be cumbersome and difficult. But when **working with containers** in most cases that functionality is included by default. ✨

## Replication - Number of Processes

If you have a <abbr title="A group of machines that are configured to be connected and work together in some way.">cluster</abbr> of machines with **Kubernetes**, Docker Swarm Mode, Nomad, or another similar complex system to manage distributed containers on multiple machines, then you will probably want to **handle replication** at the **cluster level** instead of using a **process manager** (like Uvicorn with workers) in each container.

One of those distributed container management systems like Kubernetes normally has some integrated way of handling **replication of containers** while still supporting **load balancing** for the incoming requests. All at the **cluster level**.

In those cases, you would probably want to build a **Docker image from scratch** as [explained above](#dockerfile), installing your dependencies, and running **a single Uvicorn process** instead of using multiple Uvicorn workers.

### Load Balancer

When using containers, you would normally have some component **listening on the main port**. It could possibly be another container that is also a **TLS Termination Proxy** to handle **HTTPS** or some similar tool.

As this component would take the **load** of requests and distribute that among the workers in a (hopefully) **balanced** way, it is also commonly called a **Load Balancer**.

/// tip

The same **TLS Termination Proxy** component used for HTTPS would probably also be a **Load Balancer**.

///

And when working with containers, the same system you use to start and manage them would already have internal tools to transmit the **network communication** (e.g. HTTP requests) from that **load balancer** (that could also be a **TLS Termination Proxy**) to the container(s) with your app.

### One Load Balancer - Multiple Worker Containers

When working with **Kubernetes** or similar distributed container management systems, using their internal networking mechanisms would allow the single **load balancer** that is listening on the main **port** to transmit communication (requests) to possibly **multiple containers** running your app.

Each of these containers running your app would normally have **just one process** (e.g. a Uvicorn process running your FastAPI application). They would all be **identical containers**, running the same thing, but each with its own process, memory, etc. That way you would take advantage of **parallelization** in **different cores** of the CPU, or even in **different machines**.

And the distributed container system with the **load balancer** would **distribute the requests** to each one of the containers with your app **in turns**. So, each request could be handled by one of the multiple **replicated containers** running your app.

And normally this **load balancer** would be able to handle requests that go to *other* apps in your cluster (e.g. to a different domain, or under a different URL path prefix), and would transmit that communication to the right containers for *that other* application running in your cluster.

### One Process per Container

In this type of scenario, you probably would want to have **a single (Uvicorn) process per container**, as you would already be handling replication at the cluster level.

So, in this case, you **would not** want to have a multiple workers in the container, for example with the `--workers` command line option.You would want to have just a **single Uvicorn process** per container (but probably multiple containers).

Having another process manager inside the container (as would be with multiple workers) would only add **unnecessary complexity** that you are most probably already taking care of with your cluster system.

### Containers with Multiple Processes and Special Cases

Of course, there are **special cases** where you could want to have **a container** with several **Uvicorn worker processes** inside.

In those cases, you can use the `--workers` command line option to set the number of workers that you want to run:

```{ .dockerfile .annotate }
FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /code

COPY ./requirements.txt /code/requirements.txt

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /code/requirements.txt

COPY ./app /code/app

# (1)!
CMD ["fastapi", "run", "app/main.py", "--port", "80", "--workers", "4"]
```

1. Here we use the `--workers` command line option to set the number of workers to 4.

Here are some examples of when that could make sense:

#### A Simple App

You could want a process manager in the container if your application is **simple enough** that can run it on a **single server**, not a cluster.

#### Docker Compose

You could be deploying to a **single server** (not a cluster) with **Docker Compose**, so you wouldn't have an easy way to manage replication of containers (with Docker Compose) while preserving the shared network and **load balancing**.

Then you could want to have **a single container** with a **process manager** starting **several worker processes** inside.

---

The main point is, **none** of these are **rules written in stone** that you have to blindly follow. You can use these ideas to **evaluate your own use case** and decide what is the best approach for your system, checking out how to manage the concepts of:

* Security - HTTPS
* Running on startup
* Restarts
* Replication (the number of processes running)
* Memory
* Previous steps before starting

## Memory

If you run **a single process per container** you will have a more or less well-defined, stable, and limited amount of memory consumed by each of those containers (more than one if they are replicated).

And then you can set those same memory limits and requirements in your configurations for your container management system (for example in **Kubernetes**). That way it will be able to **replicate the containers** in the **available machines** taking into account the amount of memory needed by them, and the amount available in the machines in the cluster.

If your application is **simple**, this will probably **not be a problem**, and you might not need to specify hard memory limits. But if you are **using a lot of memory** (for example with **machine learning** models), you should check how much memory you are consuming and adjust the **number of containers** that runs in **each machine** (and maybe add more machines to your cluster).

If you run **multiple processes per container** you will have to make sure that the number of processes started doesn't **consume more memory** than what is available.

## Previous Steps Before Starting and Containers

If you are using containers (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes), then there are two main approaches you can use.

### Multiple Containers

If you have **multiple containers**, probably each one running a **single process** (for example, in a **Kubernetes** cluster), then you would probably want to have a **separate container** doing the work of the **previous steps** in a single container, running a single process, **before** running the replicated worker containers.

/// info

If you are using Kubernetes, this would probably be an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Init Container</a>.

///

If in your use case there's no problem in running those previous steps **multiple times in parallel** (for example if you are not running database migrations, but just checking if the database is ready yet), then you could also just put them in each container right before starting the main process.

### Single Container

If you have a simple setup, with a **single container** that then starts multiple **worker processes** (or also just one process), then you could run those previous steps in the same container, right before starting the process with the app.

### Base Docker Image

There used to be an official FastAPI Docker image: <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi-docker" class="external-link" target="_blank">tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi</a>. But it is now deprecated. ⛔️

You should probably **not** use this base Docker image (or any other similar one).

If you are using **Kubernetes** (or others) and you are already setting **replication** at the cluster level, with multiple **containers**. In those cases, you are better off **building an image from scratch** as described above: [Build a Docker Image for FastAPI](#build-a-docker-image-for-fastapi).

And if you need to have multiple workers, you can simply use the `--workers` command line option.

/// note | Technical Details

The Docker image was created when Uvicorn didn't support managing and restarting dead workers, so it was needed to use Gunicorn with Uvicorn, which added quite some complexity, just to have Gunicorn manage and restart the Uvicorn worker processes.

But now that Uvicorn (and the `fastapi` command) support using `--workers`, there's no reason to use a base Docker image instead of building your own (it's pretty much the same amount of code 😅).

///

## Deploy the Container Image

After having a Container (Docker) Image there are several ways to deploy it.

For example:

* With **Docker Compose** in a single server
* With a **Kubernetes** cluster
* With a Docker Swarm Mode cluster
* With another tool like Nomad
* With a cloud service that takes your container image and deploys it

## Docker Image with `uv`

If you are using <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv" class="external-link" target="_blank">uv</a> to install and manage your project, you can follow their <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/" class="external-link" target="_blank">uv Docker guide</a>.

## Recap

Using container systems (e.g. with **Docker** and **Kubernetes**) it becomes fairly straightforward to handle all the **deployment concepts**:

* HTTPS
* Running on startup
* Restarts
* Replication (the number of processes running)
* Memory
* Previous steps before starting

In most cases, you probably won't want to use any base image, and instead **build a container image from scratch** based on the official Python Docker image.

Taking care of the **order** of instructions in the `Dockerfile` and the **Docker cache** you can **minimize build times**, to maximize your productivity (and avoid boredom). 😎

# About HTTPS

It is easy to assume that HTTPS is something that is just "enabled" or not.

But it is way more complex than that.

/// tip

If you are in a hurry or don't care, continue with the next sections for step by step instructions to set everything up with different techniques.

///

To **learn the basics of HTTPS**, from a consumer perspective, check <a href="https://howhttps.works/" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://howhttps.works/</a>.

Now, from a **developer's perspective**, here are several things to keep in mind while thinking about HTTPS:

* For HTTPS, **the server** needs to **have "certificates"** generated by a **third party**.
    * Those certificates are actually **acquired** from the third party, not "generated".
* Certificates have a **lifetime**.
    * They **expire**.
    * And then they need to be **renewed**, **acquired again** from the third party.
* The encryption of the connection happens at the **TCP level**.
    * That's one layer **below HTTP**.
    * So, the **certificate and encryption** handling is done **before HTTP**.
* **TCP doesn't know about "domains"**. Only about IP addresses.
    * The information about the **specific domain** requested goes in the **HTTP data**.
* The **HTTPS certificates** "certify" a **certain domain**, but the protocol and encryption happen at the TCP level, **before knowing** which domain is being dealt with.
* **By default**, that would mean that you can only have **one HTTPS certificate per IP address**.
    * No matter how big your server is or how small each application you have on it might be.
    * There is a **solution** to this, however.
* There's an **extension** to the **TLS** protocol (the one handling the encryption at the TCP level, before HTTP) called **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication" class="external-link" target="_blank"><abbr title="Server Name Indication">SNI</abbr></a>**.
    * This SNI extension allows one single server (with a **single IP address**) to have **several HTTPS certificates** and serve **multiple HTTPS domains/applications**.
    * For this to work, a **single** component (program) running on the server, listening on the **public IP address**, must have **all the HTTPS certificates** in the server.
* **After** obtaining a secure connection, the communication protocol is **still HTTP**.
    * The contents are **encrypted**, even though they are being sent with the **HTTP protocol**.

It is a common practice to have **one program/HTTP server** running on the server (the machine, host, etc.) and **managing all the HTTPS parts**: receiving the **encrypted HTTPS requests**, sending the **decrypted HTTP requests** to the actual HTTP application running in the same server (the **FastAPI** application, in this case), take the **HTTP response** from the application, **encrypt it** using the appropriate **HTTPS certificate** and sending it back to the client using **HTTPS**. This server is often called a **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS_termination_proxy" class="external-link" target="_blank">TLS Termination Proxy</a>**.

Some of the options you could use as a TLS Termination Proxy are:

* Traefik (that can also handle certificate renewals)
* Caddy (that can also handle certificate renewals)
* Nginx
* HAProxy

## Let's Encrypt

Before Let's Encrypt, these **HTTPS certificates** were sold by trusted third parties.

The process to acquire one of these certificates used to be cumbersome, require quite some paperwork and the certificates were quite expensive.

But then **<a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Let's Encrypt</a>** was created.

It is a project from the Linux Foundation. It provides **HTTPS certificates for free**, in an automated way. These certificates use all the standard cryptographic security, and are short-lived (about 3 months), so the **security is actually better** because of their reduced lifespan.

The domains are securely verified and the certificates are generated automatically. This also allows automating the renewal of these certificates.

The idea is to automate the acquisition and renewal of these certificates so that you can have **secure HTTPS, for free, forever**.

## HTTPS for Developers

Here's an example of how an HTTPS API could look like, step by step, paying attention mainly to the ideas important for developers.

### Domain Name

It would probably all start by you **acquiring** some **domain name**. Then, you would configure it in a DNS server (possibly your same cloud provider).

You would probably get a cloud server (a virtual machine) or something similar, and it would have a <abbr title="That doesn't change">fixed</abbr> **public IP address**.

In the DNS server(s) you would configure a record (an "`A record`") to point **your domain** to the public **IP address of your server**.

You would probably do this just once, the first time, when setting everything up.

/// tip

This Domain Name part is way before HTTPS, but as everything depends on the domain and the IP address, it's worth mentioning it here.

///

### DNS

Now let's focus on all the actual HTTPS parts.

First, the browser would check with the **DNS servers** what is the **IP for the domain**, in this case, `someapp.example.com`.

The DNS servers would tell the browser to use some specific **IP address**. That would be the public IP address used by your server, that you configured in the DNS servers.

<img src="/img/deployment/https/https01.drawio.svg">

### TLS Handshake Start

The browser would then communicate with that IP address on **port 443** (the HTTPS port).

The first part of the communication is just to establish the connection between the client and the server and to decide the cryptographic keys they will use, etc.

<img src="/img/deployment/https/https02.drawio.svg">

This interaction between the client and the server to establish the TLS connection is called the **TLS handshake**.

### TLS with SNI Extension

**Only one process** in the server can be listening on a specific **port** in a specific **IP address**. There could be other processes listening on other ports in the same IP address, but only one for each combination of IP address and port.

TLS (HTTPS) uses the specific port `443` by default. So that's the port we would need.

As only one process can be listening on this port, the process that would do it would be the **TLS Termination Proxy**.

The TLS Termination Proxy would have access to one or more **TLS certificates** (HTTPS certificates).

Using the **SNI extension** discussed above, the TLS Termination Proxy would check which of the TLS (HTTPS) certificates available it should use for this connection, using the one that matches the domain expected by the client.

In this case, it would use the certificate for `someapp.example.com`.

<img src="/img/deployment/https/https03.drawio.svg">

The client already **trusts** the entity that generated that TLS certificate (in this case Let's Encrypt, but we'll see about that later), so it can **verify** that the certificate is valid.

Then, using the certificate, the client and the TLS Termination Proxy **decide how to encrypt** the rest of the **TCP communication**. This completes the **TLS Handshake** part.

After this, the client and the server have an **encrypted TCP connection**, this is what TLS provides. And then they can use that connection to start the actual **HTTP communication**.

And that's what **HTTPS** is, it's just plain **HTTP** inside a **secure TLS connection** instead of a pure (unencrypted) TCP connection.

/// tip

Notice that the encryption of the communication happens at the **TCP level**, not at the HTTP level.

///

### HTTPS Request

Now that the client and server (specifically the browser and the TLS Termination Proxy) have an **encrypted TCP connection**, they can start the **HTTP communication**.

So, the client sends an **HTTPS request**. This is just an HTTP request through an encrypted TLS connection.

<img src="/img/deployment/https/https04.drawio.svg">

### Decrypt the Request

The TLS Termination Proxy would use the encryption agreed to **decrypt the request**, and would transmit the **plain (decrypted) HTTP request** to the process running the application (for example a process with Uvicorn running the FastAPI application).

<img src="/img/deployment/https/https05.drawio.svg">

### HTTP Response

The application would process the request and send a **plain (unencrypted) HTTP response** to the TLS Termination Proxy.

<img src="/img/deployment/https/https06.drawio.svg">

### HTTPS Response

The TLS Termination Proxy would then **encrypt the response** using the cryptography agreed before (that started with the certificate for `someapp.example.com`), and send it back to the browser.

Next, the browser would verify that the response is valid and encrypted with the right cryptographic key, etc. It would then **decrypt the response** and process it.

<img src="/img/deployment/https/https07.drawio.svg">

The client (browser) will know that the response comes from the correct server because it is using the cryptography they agreed using the **HTTPS certificate** before.

### Multiple Applications

In the same server (or servers), there could be **multiple applications**, for example, other API programs or a database.

Only one process can be handling the specific IP and port (the TLS Termination Proxy in our example) but the other applications/processes can be running on the server(s) too, as long as they don't try to use the same **combination of public IP and port**.

<img src="/img/deployment/https/https08.drawio.svg">

That way, the TLS Termination Proxy could handle HTTPS and certificates for **multiple domains**, for multiple applications, and then transmit the requests to the right application in each case.

### Certificate Renewal

At some point in the future, each certificate would **expire** (about 3 months after acquiring it).

And then, there would be another program (in some cases it's another program, in some cases it could be the same TLS Termination Proxy) that would talk to Let's Encrypt, and renew the certificate(s).

<img src="/img/deployment/https/https.drawio.svg">

The **TLS certificates** are **associated with a domain name**, not with an IP address.

So, to renew the certificates, the renewal program needs to **prove** to the authority (Let's Encrypt) that it indeed **"owns" and controls that domain**.

To do that, and to accommodate different application needs, there are several ways it can do it. Some popular ways are:

* **Modify some DNS records**.
    * For this, the renewal program needs to support the APIs of the DNS provider, so, depending on the DNS provider you are using, this might or might not be an option.
* **Run as a server** (at least during the certificate acquisition process) on the public IP address associated with the domain.
    * As we said above, only one process can be listening on a specific IP and port.
    * This is one of the reasons why it's very useful when the same TLS Termination Proxy also takes care of the certificate renewal process.
    * Otherwise, you might have to stop the TLS Termination Proxy momentarily, start the renewal program to acquire the certificates, then configure them with the TLS Termination Proxy, and then restart the TLS Termination Proxy. This is not ideal, as your app(s) will not be available during the time that the TLS Termination Proxy is off.

All this renewal process, while still serving the app, is one of the main reasons why you would want to have a **separate system to handle HTTPS** with a TLS Termination Proxy instead of just using the TLS certificates with the application server directly (e.g. Uvicorn).

## Recap

Having **HTTPS** is very important, and quite **critical** in most cases. Most of the effort you as a developer have to put around HTTPS is just about **understanding these concepts** and how they work.

But once you know the basic information of **HTTPS for developers** you can easily combine and configure different tools to help you manage everything in a simple way.

In some of the next chapters, I'll show you several concrete examples of how to set up **HTTPS** for **FastAPI** applications. 🔒

# Deployment

Deploying a **FastAPI** application is relatively easy.

## What Does Deployment Mean

To **deploy** an application means to perform the necessary steps to make it **available to the users**.

For a **web API**, it normally involves putting it in a **remote machine**, with a **server program** that provides good performance, stability, etc, so that your **users** can **access** the application efficiently and without interruptions or problems.

This is in contrast to the **development** stages, where you are constantly changing the code, breaking it and fixing it, stopping and restarting the development server, etc.

## Deployment Strategies

There are several ways to do it depending on your specific use case and the tools that you use.

You could **deploy a server** yourself using a combination of tools, you could use a **cloud service** that does part of the work for you, or other possible options.

I will show you some of the main concepts you should probably keep in mind when deploying a **FastAPI** application (although most of it applies to any other type of web application).

You will see more details to keep in mind and some of the techniques to do it in the next sections. ✨

# Run a Server Manually

## Use the `fastapi run` Command

In short, use `fastapi run` to serve your FastAPI application:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ <font color="#4E9A06">fastapi</font> run <u style="text-decoration-style:solid">main.py</u>

             to quit<b>)</b>
```

</div>

That would work for most of the cases. 😎

You could use that command for example to start your **FastAPI** app in a container, in a server, etc.

## ASGI Servers

Let's go a little deeper into the details.

FastAPI uses a standard for building Python web frameworks and servers called <abbr title="Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface">ASGI</abbr>. FastAPI is an ASGI web framework.

The main thing you need to run a **FastAPI** application (or any other ASGI application) in a remote server machine is an ASGI server program like **Uvicorn**, this is the one that comes by default in the `fastapi` command.

There are several alternatives, including:

* <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Uvicorn</a>: a high performance ASGI server.
* <a href="https://hypercorn.readthedocs.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Hypercorn</a>: an ASGI server compatible with HTTP/2 and Trio among other features.
* <a href="https://github.com/django/daphne" class="external-link" target="_blank">Daphne</a>: the ASGI server built for Django Channels.
* <a href="https://github.com/emmett-framework/granian" class="external-link" target="_blank">Granian</a>: A Rust HTTP server for Python applications.
* <a href="https://unit.nginx.org/howto/fastapi/" class="external-link" target="_blank">NGINX Unit</a>: NGINX Unit is a lightweight and versatile web application runtime.

## Server Machine and Server Program

There's a small detail about names to keep in mind. 💡

The word "**server**" is commonly used to refer to both the remote/cloud computer (the physical or virtual machine) and also the program that is running on that machine (e.g. Uvicorn).

Just keep in mind that when you read "server" in general, it could refer to one of those two things.

When referring to the remote machine, it's common to call it **server**, but also **machine**, **VM** (virtual machine), **node**. Those all refer to some type of remote machine, normally running Linux, where you run programs.

## Install the Server Program

When you install FastAPI, it comes with a production server, Uvicorn, and you can start it with the `fastapi run` command.

But you can also install an ASGI server manually.

Make sure you create a [virtual environment](../virtual-environments.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, activate it, and then you can install the server application.

For example, to install Uvicorn:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install "uvicorn[standard]"

---> 100%
```

</div>

A similar process would apply to any other ASGI server program.

/// tip

By adding the `standard`, Uvicorn will install and use some recommended extra dependencies.

That including `uvloop`, the high-performance drop-in replacement for `asyncio`, that provides the big concurrency performance boost.

When you install FastAPI with something like `pip install "fastapi[standard]"` you already get `uvicorn[standard]` as well.

///

## Run the Server Program

If you installed an ASGI server manually, you would normally need to pass an import string in a special format for it to import your FastAPI application:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80

<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:80 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

</div>

/// note

The command `uvicorn main:app` refers to:

* `main`: the file `main.py` (the Python "module").
* `app`: the object created inside of `main.py` with the line `app = FastAPI()`.

It is equivalent to:

```Python
from main import app
```

///

Each alternative ASGI server program would have a similar command, you can read more in their respective documentation.

/// warning

Uvicorn and other servers support a `--reload` option that is useful during development.

The `--reload` option consumes much more resources, is more unstable, etc.

It helps a lot during **development**, but you **shouldn't** use it in **production**.

///

## Deployment Concepts

These examples run the server program (e.g Uvicorn), starting **a single process**, listening on all the IPs (`0.0.0.0`) on a predefined port (e.g. `80`).

This is the basic idea. But you will probably want to take care of some additional things, like:

* Security - HTTPS
* Running on startup
* Restarts
* Replication (the number of processes running)
* Memory
* Previous steps before starting

I'll tell you more about each of these concepts, how to think about them, and some concrete examples with strategies to handle them in the next chapters. 🚀

# Server Workers - Uvicorn with Workers

Let's check back those deployment concepts from before:

* Security - HTTPS
* Running on startup
* Restarts
* **Replication (the number of processes running)**
* Memory
* Previous steps before starting

Up to this point, with all the tutorials in the docs, you have probably been running a **server program**, for example, using the `fastapi` command, that runs Uvicorn, running a **single process**.

When deploying applications you will probably want to have some **replication of processes** to take advantage of **multiple cores** and to be able to handle more requests.

As you saw in the previous chapter about [Deployment Concepts](concepts.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, there are multiple strategies you can use.

Here I'll show you how to use **Uvicorn** with **worker processes** using the `fastapi` command or the `uvicorn` command directly.

/// info

If you are using containers, for example with Docker or Kubernetes, I'll tell you more about that in the next chapter: [FastAPI in Containers - Docker](docker.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

In particular, when running on **Kubernetes** you will probably **not** want to use workers and instead run **a single Uvicorn process per container**, but I'll tell you about it later in that chapter.

///

## Multiple Workers

You can start multiple workers with the `--workers` command line option:

//// tab | `fastapi`

////

The only new option here is `--workers` telling Uvicorn to start 4 worker processes.

You can also see that it shows the **PID** of each process, `27365` for the parent process (this is the **process manager**) and one for each worker process: `27368`, `27369`, `27370`, and `27367`.

## Deployment Concepts

Here you saw how to use multiple **workers** to **parallelize** the execution of the application, take advantage of **multiple cores** in the CPU, and be able to serve **more requests**.

From the list of deployment concepts from above, using workers would mainly help with the **replication** part, and a little bit with the **restarts**, but you still need to take care of the others:

* **Security - HTTPS**
* **Running on startup**
* ***Restarts***
* Replication (the number of processes running)
* **Memory**
* **Previous steps before starting**

## Containers and Docker

In the next chapter about [FastAPI in Containers - Docker](docker.md){.internal-link target=_blank} I'll explain some strategies you could use to handle the other **deployment concepts**.

I'll show you how to **build your own image from scratch** to run a single Uvicorn process. It is a simple process and is probably what you would want to do when using a distributed container management system like **Kubernetes**.

## Recap

You can use multiple worker processes with the `--workers` CLI option with the `fastapi` or `uvicorn` commands to take advantage of **multi-core CPUs**, to run **multiple processes in parallel**.

You could use these tools and ideas if you are setting up **your own deployment system** while taking care of the other deployment concepts yourself.

Check out the next chapter to learn about **FastAPI** with containers (e.g. Docker and Kubernetes). You will see that those tools have simple ways to solve the other **deployment concepts** as well. ✨

# About FastAPI versions

**FastAPI** is already being used in production in many applications and systems. And the test coverage is kept at 100%. But its development is still moving quickly.

New features are added frequently, bugs are fixed regularly, and the code is still continuously improving.

That's why the current versions are still `0.x.x`, this reflects that each version could potentially have breaking changes. This follows the <a href="https://semver.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Semantic Versioning</a> conventions.

You can create production applications with **FastAPI** right now (and you have probably been doing it for some time), you just have to make sure that you use a version that works correctly with the rest of your code.

## Pin your `fastapi` version

The first thing you should do is to "pin" the version of **FastAPI** you are using to the specific latest version that you know works correctly for your application.

For example, let's say you are using version `0.112.0` in your app.

If you use a `requirements.txt` file you could specify the version with:

```txt
fastapi[standard]==0.112.0
```

that would mean that you would use exactly the version `0.112.0`.

Or you could also pin it with:

```txt
fastapi[standard]>=0.112.0,<0.113.0
```

that would mean that you would use the versions `0.112.0` or above, but less than `0.113.0`, for example, a version `0.112.2` would still be accepted.

If you use any other tool to manage your installations, like `uv`, Poetry, Pipenv, or others, they all have a way that you can use to define specific versions for your packages.

## Available versions

You can see the available versions (e.g. to check what is the current latest) in the [Release Notes](../release-notes.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

## About versions

Following the Semantic Versioning conventions, any version below `1.0.0` could potentially add breaking changes.

FastAPI also follows the convention that any "PATCH" version change is for bug fixes and non-breaking changes.

/// tip

The "PATCH" is the last number, for example, in `0.2.3`, the PATCH version is `3`.

///

So, you should be able to pin to a version like:

```txt
fastapi>=0.45.0,<0.46.0
```

Breaking changes and new features are added in "MINOR" versions.

/// tip

The "MINOR" is the number in the middle, for example, in `0.2.3`, the MINOR version is `2`.

///

## Upgrading the FastAPI versions

You should add tests for your app.

With **FastAPI** it's very easy (thanks to Starlette), check the docs: [Testing](../tutorial/testing.md){.internal-link target=_blank}

After you have tests, then you can upgrade the **FastAPI** version to a more recent one, and make sure that all your code is working correctly by running your tests.

If everything is working, or after you make the necessary changes, and all your tests are passing, then you can pin your `fastapi` to that new recent version.

## About Starlette

You shouldn't pin the version of `starlette`.

Different versions of **FastAPI** will use a specific newer version of Starlette.

So, you can just let **FastAPI** use the correct Starlette version.

## About Pydantic

Pydantic includes the tests for **FastAPI** with its own tests, so new versions of Pydantic (above `1.0.0`) are always compatible with FastAPI.

You can pin Pydantic to any version above `1.0.0` that works for you.

For example:

```txt
pydantic>=2.7.0,<3.0.0
```

# Conditional OpenAPI

If you needed to, you could use settings and environment variables to configure OpenAPI conditionally depending on the environment, and even disable it entirely.

## About security, APIs, and docs

Hiding your documentation user interfaces in production *shouldn't* be the way to protect your API.

That doesn't add any extra security to your API, the *path operations* will still be available where they are.

If there's a security flaw in your code, it will still exist.

Hiding the documentation just makes it more difficult to understand how to interact with your API, and could make it more difficult for you to debug it in production. It could be considered simply a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity" class="external-link" target="_blank">Security through obscurity</a>.

If you want to secure your API, there are several better things you can do, for example:

* Make sure you have well defined Pydantic models for your request bodies and responses.
* Configure any required permissions and roles using dependencies.
* Never store plaintext passwords, only password hashes.
* Implement and use well-known cryptographic tools, like Passlib and JWT tokens, etc.
* Add more granular permission controls with OAuth2 scopes where needed.
* ...etc.

Nevertheless, you might have a very specific use case where you really need to disable the API docs for some environment (e.g. for production) or depending on configurations from environment variables.

## Conditional OpenAPI from settings and env vars

You can easily use the same Pydantic settings to configure your generated OpenAPI and the docs UIs.

For example:

{* ../../docs_src/conditional_openapi/tutorial001.py hl[6,11] *}

Here we declare the setting `openapi_url` with the same default of `"/openapi.json"`.

And then we use it when creating the `FastAPI` app.

Then you could disable OpenAPI (including the UI docs) by setting the environment variable `OPENAPI_URL` to the empty string, like:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ OPENAPI_URL= uvicorn main:app

<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

</div>

Then if you go to the URLs at `/openapi.json`, `/docs`, or `/redoc` you will just get a `404 Not Found` error like:

```JSON
{
    "detail": "Not Found"
}
```
````

## File: docs/en/docs/how-to/configure-swagger-ui.md
````markdown
# Configure Swagger UI

You can configure some extra <a href="https://swagger.io/docs/open-source-tools/swagger-ui/usage/configuration/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Swagger UI parameters</a>.

To configure them, pass the `swagger_ui_parameters` argument when creating the `FastAPI()` app object or to the `get_swagger_ui_html()` function.

`swagger_ui_parameters` receives a dictionary with the configurations passed to Swagger UI directly.

FastAPI converts the configurations to **JSON** to make them compatible with JavaScript, as that's what Swagger UI needs.

## Disable Syntax Highlighting

For example, you could disable syntax highlighting in Swagger UI.

Without changing the settings, syntax highlighting is enabled by default:

<img src="/img/tutorial/extending-openapi/image02.png">

But you can disable it by setting `syntaxHighlight` to `False`:

{* ../../docs_src/configure_swagger_ui/tutorial001.py hl[3] *}

...and then Swagger UI won't show the syntax highlighting anymore:

<img src="/img/tutorial/extending-openapi/image03.png">

## Change the Theme

The same way you could set the syntax highlighting theme with the key `"syntaxHighlight.theme"` (notice that it has a dot in the middle):

{* ../../docs_src/configure_swagger_ui/tutorial002.py hl[3] *}

That configuration would change the syntax highlighting color theme:

<img src="/img/tutorial/extending-openapi/image04.png">

## Change Default Swagger UI Parameters

FastAPI includes some default configuration parameters appropriate for most of the use cases.

It includes these default configurations:

{* ../../fastapi/openapi/docs.py ln[8:23] hl[17:23] *}

You can override any of them by setting a different value in the argument `swagger_ui_parameters`.

For example, to disable `deepLinking` you could pass these settings to `swagger_ui_parameters`:

{* ../../docs_src/configure_swagger_ui/tutorial003.py hl[3] *}

## Other Swagger UI Parameters

To see all the other possible configurations you can use, read the official <a href="https://swagger.io/docs/open-source-tools/swagger-ui/usage/configuration/" class="external-link" target="_blank">docs for Swagger UI parameters</a>.

## JavaScript-only settings

Swagger UI also allows other configurations to be **JavaScript-only** objects (for example, JavaScript functions).

FastAPI also includes these JavaScript-only `presets` settings:

```JavaScript
presets: [
    SwaggerUIBundle.presets.apis,
    SwaggerUIBundle.SwaggerUIStandalonePreset
]
```

These are **JavaScript** objects, not strings, so you can't pass them from Python code directly.

If you need to use JavaScript-only configurations like those, you can use one of the methods above. Override all the Swagger UI *path operation* and manually write any JavaScript you need.

````markdown
# Custom Docs UI Static Assets (Self-Hosting)

The API docs use **Swagger UI** and **ReDoc**, and each of those need some JavaScript and CSS files.

By default, those files are served from a <abbr title="Content Delivery Network: A service, normally composed of several servers, that provides static files, like JavaScript and CSS. It's commonly used to serve those files from the server closer to the client, improving performance.">CDN</abbr>.

But it's possible to customize it, you can set a specific CDN, or serve the files yourself.

## Custom CDN for JavaScript and CSS

Let's say that you want to use a different <abbr title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</abbr>, for example you want to use `https://unpkg.com/`.

This could be useful if for example you live in a country that restricts some URLs.

### Disable the automatic docs

The first step is to disable the automatic docs, as by default, those use the default CDN.

To disable them, set their URLs to `None` when creating your `FastAPI` app:

{* ../../docs_src/custom_docs_ui/tutorial001.py hl[8] *}

### Include the custom docs

Now you can create the *path operations* for the custom docs.

You can reuse FastAPI's internal functions to create the HTML pages for the docs, and pass them the needed arguments:

* `openapi_url`: the URL where the HTML page for the docs can get the OpenAPI schema for your API. You can use here the attribute `app.openapi_url`.
* `title`: the title of your API.
* `oauth2_redirect_url`: you can use `app.swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_url` here to use the default.
* `swagger_js_url`: the URL where the HTML for your Swagger UI docs can get the **JavaScript** file. This is the custom CDN URL.
* `swagger_css_url`: the URL where the HTML for your Swagger UI docs can get the **CSS** file. This is the custom CDN URL.

And similarly for ReDoc...

{* ../../docs_src/custom_docs_ui/tutorial001.py hl[2:6,11:19,22:24,27:33] *}

/// tip

The *path operation* for `swagger_ui_redirect` is a helper for when you use OAuth2.

If you integrate your API with an OAuth2 provider, you will be able to authenticate and come back to the API docs with the acquired credentials. And interact with it using the real OAuth2 authentication.

Swagger UI will handle it behind the scenes for you, but it needs this "redirect" helper.

///

### Create a *path operation* to test it

Now, to be able to test that everything works, create a *path operation*:

{* ../../docs_src/custom_docs_ui/tutorial001.py hl[36:38] *}

### Test it

Now, you should be able to go to your docs at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>, and reload the page, it will load those assets from the new CDN.

## Self-hosting JavaScript and CSS for docs

Self-hosting the JavaScript and CSS could be useful if, for example, you need your app to keep working even while offline, without open Internet access, or in a local network.

Here you'll see how to serve those files yourself, in the same FastAPI app, and configure the docs to use them.

### Project file structure

Let's say your project file structure looks like this:

```
.
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
```

Now create a directory to store those static files.

Your new file structure could look like this:

```
.
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
└── static/
```

### Download the files

Download the static files needed for the docs and put them on that `static/` directory.

You can probably right-click each link and select an option similar to `Save link as...`.

**Swagger UI** uses the files:

* <a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swagger-ui-dist@5/swagger-ui-bundle.js" class="external-link" target="_blank">`swagger-ui-bundle.js`</a>
* <a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swagger-ui-dist@5/swagger-ui.css" class="external-link" target="_blank">`swagger-ui.css`</a>

And **ReDoc** uses the file:

* <a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/redoc@2/bundles/redoc.standalone.js" class="external-link" target="_blank">`redoc.standalone.js`</a>

After that, your file structure could look like:

```
.
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
└── static
    ├── redoc.standalone.js
    ├── swagger-ui-bundle.js
    └── swagger-ui.css
```

### Serve the static files

* Import `StaticFiles`.
* "Mount" a `StaticFiles()` instance in a specific path.

{* ../../docs_src/custom_docs_ui/tutorial002.py hl[7,11] *}

### Test the static files

Start your application and go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/redoc.standalone.js" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/redoc.standalone.js</a>.

You should see a very long JavaScript file for **ReDoc**.

It could start with something like:

```JavaScript
/*! For license information please see redoc.standalone.js.LICENSE.txt */
!function(e,t){"object"==typeof exports&&"object"==typeof module?module.exports=t(require("null")):
...
```

That confirms that you are being able to serve static files from your app, and that you placed the static files for the docs in the correct place.

Now we can configure the app to use those static files for the docs.

### Disable the automatic docs for static files

The same as when using a custom CDN, the first step is to disable the automatic docs, as those use the CDN by default.

To disable them, set their URLs to `None` when creating your `FastAPI` app:

{* ../../docs_src/custom_docs_ui/tutorial002.py hl[9] *}

### Include the custom docs for static files

And the same way as with a custom CDN, now you can create the *path operations* for the custom docs.

Again, you can reuse FastAPI's internal functions to create the HTML pages for the docs, and pass them the needed arguments:

* `openapi_url`: the URL where the HTML page for the docs can get the OpenAPI schema for your API. You can use here the attribute `app.openapi_url`.
* `title`: the title of your API.
* `oauth2_redirect_url`: you can use `app.swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_url` here to use the default.
* `swagger_js_url`: the URL where the HTML for your Swagger UI docs can get the **JavaScript** file. **This is the one that your own app is now serving**.
* `swagger_css_url`: the URL where the HTML for your Swagger UI docs can get the **CSS** file. **This is the one that your own app is now serving**.

And similarly for ReDoc...

{* ../../docs_src/custom_docs_ui/tutorial002.py hl[2:6,14:22,25:27,30:36] *}

/// tip

The *path operation* for `swagger_ui_redirect` is a helper for when you use OAuth2.

If you integrate your API with an OAuth2 provider, you will be able to authenticate and come back to the API docs with the acquired credentials. And interact with it using the real OAuth2 authentication.

Swagger UI will handle it behind the scenes for you, but it needs this "redirect" helper.

///

### Create a *path operation* to test static files

Now, to be able to test that everything works, create a *path operation*:

{* ../../docs_src/custom_docs_ui/tutorial002.py hl[39:41] *}

### Test Static Files UI

Now, you should be able to disconnect your WiFi, go to your docs at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>, and reload the page.

And even without Internet, you would be able to see the docs for your API and interact with it.

# Custom Request and APIRoute class

In some cases, you may want to override the logic used by the `Request` and `APIRoute` classes.

In particular, this may be a good alternative to logic in a middleware.

For example, if you want to read or manipulate the request body before it is processed by your application.

/// danger

This is an "advanced" feature.

If you are just starting with **FastAPI** you might want to skip this section.

///

## Use cases

Some use cases include:

* Converting non-JSON request bodies to JSON (e.g. <a href="https://msgpack.org/index.html" class="external-link" target="_blank">`msgpack`</a>).
* Decompressing gzip-compressed request bodies.
* Automatically logging all request bodies.

## Handling custom request body encodings

Let's see how to make use of a custom `Request` subclass to decompress gzip requests.

And an `APIRoute` subclass to use that custom request class.

### Create a custom `GzipRequest` class

/// tip

This is a toy example to demonstrate how it works, if you need Gzip support, you can use the provided [`GzipMiddleware`](../advanced/middleware.md#gzipmiddleware){.internal-link target=_blank}.

///

First, we create a `GzipRequest` class, which will overwrite the `Request.body()` method to decompress the body in the presence of an appropriate header.

If there's no `gzip` in the header, it will not try to decompress the body.

That way, the same route class can handle gzip compressed or uncompressed requests.

{* ../../docs_src/custom_request_and_route/tutorial001.py hl[8:15] *}

### Create a custom `GzipRoute` class

Next, we create a custom subclass of `fastapi.routing.APIRoute` that will make use of the `GzipRequest`.

This time, it will overwrite the method `APIRoute.get_route_handler()`.

This method returns a function. And that function is what will receive a request and return a response.

Here we use it to create a `GzipRequest` from the original request.

{* ../../docs_src/custom_request_and_route/tutorial001.py hl[18:26] *}

/// note | Technical Details

A `Request` has a `request.scope` attribute, that's just a Python `dict` containing the metadata related to the request.

A `Request` also has a `request.receive`, that's a function to "receive" the body of the request.

The `scope` `dict` and `receive` function are both part of the ASGI specification.

And those two things, `scope` and `receive`, are what is needed to create a new `Request` instance.

To learn more about the `Request` check <a href="https://www.starlette.io/requests/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Starlette's docs about Requests</a>.

///

The only thing the function returned by `GzipRequest.get_route_handler` does differently is convert the `Request` to a `GzipRequest`.

Doing this, our `GzipRequest` will take care of decompressing the data (if necessary) before passing it to our *path operations*.

After that, all of the processing logic is the same.

But because of our changes in `GzipRequest.body`, the request body will be automatically decompressed when it is loaded by **FastAPI** when needed.

## Accessing the request body in an exception handler

/// tip

To solve this same problem, it's probably a lot easier to use the `body` in a custom handler for `RequestValidationError` ([Handling Errors](../tutorial/handling-errors.md#use-the-requestvalidationerror-body){.internal-link target=_blank}).

But this example is still valid and it shows how to interact with the internal components.

///

We can also use this same approach to access the request body in an exception handler.

All we need to do is handle the request inside a `try`/`except` block:

{* ../../docs_src/custom_request_and_route/tutorial002.py hl[13,15] *}

If an exception occurs, the`Request` instance will still be in scope, so we can read and make use of the request body when handling the error:

{* ../../docs_src/custom_request_and_route/tutorial002.py hl[16:18] *}

## Custom `APIRoute` class in a router

You can also set the `route_class` parameter of an `APIRouter`:

{* ../../docs_src/custom_request_and_route/tutorial003.py hl[26] *}

In this example, the *path operations* under the `router` will use the custom `TimedRoute` class, and will have an extra `X-Response-Time` header in the response with the time it took to generate the response:

{* ../../docs_src/custom_request_and_route/tutorial003.py hl[13:20] *}

## File: docs/en/docs/how-to/extending-openapi.md
````markdown
# Extending OpenAPI

There are some cases where you might need to modify the generated OpenAPI schema.

In this section you will see how.

## The normal process

The normal (default) process, is as follows.

A `FastAPI` application (instance) has an `.openapi()` method that is expected to return the OpenAPI schema.

As part of the application object creation, a *path operation* for `/openapi.json` (or for whatever you set your `openapi_url`) is registered.

It just returns a JSON response with the result of the application's `.openapi()` method.

By default, what the method `.openapi()` does is check the property `.openapi_schema` to see if it has contents and return them.

If it doesn't, it generates them using the utility function at `fastapi.openapi.utils.get_openapi`.

And that function `get_openapi()` receives as parameters:

* `title`: The OpenAPI title, shown in the docs.
* `version`: The version of your API, e.g. `2.5.0`.
* `openapi_version`: The version of the OpenAPI specification used. By default, the latest: `3.1.0`.
* `summary`: A short summary of the API.
* `description`: The description of your API, this can include markdown and will be shown in the docs.
* `routes`: A list of routes, these are each of the registered *path operations*. They are taken from `app.routes`.

/// info

The parameter `summary` is available in OpenAPI 3.1.0 and above, supported by FastAPI 0.99.0 and above.

///

## Overriding the defaults

Using the information above, you can use the same utility function to generate the OpenAPI schema and override each part that you need.

For example, let's add <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#x-logo" class="external-link" target="_blank">ReDoc's OpenAPI extension to include a custom logo</a>.

### Normal **FastAPI**

First, write all your **FastAPI** application as normally:

{* ../../docs_src/extending_openapi/tutorial001.py hl[1,4,7:9] *}

### Generate the OpenAPI schema

Then, use the same utility function to generate the OpenAPI schema, inside a `custom_openapi()` function:

{* ../../docs_src/extending_openapi/tutorial001.py hl[2,15:21] *}

### Modify the OpenAPI schema

Now you can add the ReDoc extension, adding a custom `x-logo` to the `info` "object" in the OpenAPI schema:

{* ../../docs_src/extending_openapi/tutorial001.py hl[22:24] *}

### Cache the OpenAPI schema

You can use the property `.openapi_schema` as a "cache", to store your generated schema.

That way, your application won't have to generate the schema every time a user opens your API docs.

It will be generated only once, and then the same cached schema will be used for the next requests.

{* ../../docs_src/extending_openapi/tutorial001.py hl[13:14,25:26] *}

### Override the method

Now you can replace the `.openapi()` method with your new function.

{* ../../docs_src/extending_openapi/tutorial001.py hl[29] *}

### Check it

Once you go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc</a> you will see that you are using your custom logo (in this example, **FastAPI**'s logo):

# GraphQL

As **FastAPI** is based on the **ASGI** standard, it's very easy to integrate any **GraphQL** library also compatible with ASGI.

You can combine normal FastAPI *path operations* with GraphQL on the same application.

/// tip

**GraphQL** solves some very specific use cases.

It has **advantages** and **disadvantages** when compared to common **web APIs**.

Make sure you evaluate if the **benefits** for your use case compensate the **drawbacks**. 🤓

///

## GraphQL Libraries

Here are some of the **GraphQL** libraries that have **ASGI** support. You could use them with **FastAPI**:

* <a href="https://strawberry.rocks/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Strawberry</a> 🍓
    * With <a href="https://strawberry.rocks/docs/integrations/fastapi" class="external-link" target="_blank">docs for FastAPI</a>

    * With <a href="https://github.com/ciscorn/starlette-graphene3" class="external-link" target="_blank">starlette-graphene3</a>

## GraphQL with Strawberry

If you need or want to work with **GraphQL**, <a href="https://strawberry.rocks/" class="external-link" target="_blank">**Strawberry**</a> is the **recommended** library as it has the design closest to **FastAPI's** design, it's all based on **type annotations**.

Depending on your use case, you might prefer to use a different library, but if you asked me, I would probably suggest you try **Strawberry**.

Here's a small preview of how you could integrate Strawberry with FastAPI:

{* ../../docs_src/graphql/tutorial001.py hl[3,22,25] *}

You can learn more about Strawberry in the <a href="https://strawberry.rocks/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Strawberry documentation</a>.

And also the docs about <a href="https://strawberry.rocks/docs/integrations/fastapi" class="external-link" target="_blank">Strawberry with FastAPI</a>.

## Older `GraphQLApp` from Starlette

Previous versions of Starlette included a `GraphQLApp` class to integrate with <a href="https://graphene-python.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Graphene</a>.

It was deprecated from Starlette, but if you have code that used it, you can easily **migrate** to <a href="https://github.com/ciscorn/starlette-graphene3" class="external-link" target="_blank">starlette-graphene3</a>, that covers the same use case and has an **almost identical interface**.

/// tip

If you need GraphQL, I still would recommend you check out <a href="https://strawberry.rocks/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Strawberry</a>, as it's based on type annotations instead of custom classes and types.

///

## Learn More

You can learn more about **GraphQL** in the <a href="https://graphql.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">official GraphQL documentation</a>.

You can also read more about each those libraries described above in their links.

# Separate OpenAPI Schemas for Input and Output or Not

When using **Pydantic v2**, the generated OpenAPI is a bit more exact and **correct** than before. 😎

In fact, in some cases, it will even have **two JSON Schemas** in OpenAPI for the same Pydantic model, for input and output, depending on if they have **default values**.

Let's see how that works and how to change it if you need to do that.

## Pydantic Models for Input and Output

Let's say you have a Pydantic model with default values, like this one:

{* ../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial001_py310.py ln[1:7] hl[7] *}

### Model for Input

If you use this model as an input like here:

{* ../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial001_py310.py ln[1:15] hl[14] *}

...then the `description` field will **not be required**. Because it has a default value of `None`.

### Input Model in Docs

You can confirm that in the docs, the `description` field doesn't have a **red asterisk**, it's not marked as required:

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="/img/tutorial/separate-openapi-schemas/image01.png">
</div>

### Model for Output

But if you use the same model as an output, like here:

{* ../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial001_py310.py hl[19] *}

...then because `description` has a default value, if you **don't return anything** for that field, it will still have that **default value**.

### Model for Output Response Data

If you interact with the docs and check the response, even though the code didn't add anything in one of the `description` fields, the JSON response contains the default value (`null`):

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="/img/tutorial/separate-openapi-schemas/image02.png">
</div>

This means that it will **always have a value**, it's just that sometimes the value could be `None` (or `null` in JSON).

That means that, clients using your API don't have to check if the value exists or not, they can **assume the field will always be there**, but just that in some cases it will have the default value of `None`.

The way to describe this in OpenAPI, is to mark that field as **required**, because it will always be there.

Because of that, the JSON Schema for a model can be different depending on if it's used for **input or output**:

* for **input** the `description` will **not be required**
* for **output** it will be **required** (and possibly `None`, or in JSON terms, `null`)

### Model for Output in Docs

You can check the output model in the docs too, **both** `name` and `description` are marked as **required** with a **red asterisk**:

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="/img/tutorial/separate-openapi-schemas/image03.png">
</div>

### Model for Input and Output in Docs

And if you check all the available Schemas (JSON Schemas) in OpenAPI, you will see that there are two, one `Item-Input` and one `Item-Output`.

For `Item-Input`, `description` is **not required**, it doesn't have a red asterisk.

But for `Item-Output`, `description` is **required**, it has a red asterisk.

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="/img/tutorial/separate-openapi-schemas/image04.png">
</div>

With this feature from **Pydantic v2**, your API documentation is more **precise**, and if you have autogenerated clients and SDKs, they will be more precise too, with a better **developer experience** and consistency. 🎉

## Do not Separate Schemas

Now, there are some cases where you might want to have the **same schema for input and output**.

Probably the main use case for this is if you already have some autogenerated client code/SDKs and you don't want to update all the autogenerated client code/SDKs yet, you probably will want to do it at some point, but maybe not right now.

In that case, you can disable this feature in **FastAPI**, with the parameter `separate_input_output_schemas=False`.

/// info

Support for `separate_input_output_schemas` was added in FastAPI `0.102.0`. 🤓

///

{* ../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial002_py310.py hl[10] *}

### Same Schema for Input and Output Models in Docs

And now there will be one single schema for input and output for the model, only `Item`, and it will have `description` as **not required**:

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="/img/tutorial/separate-openapi-schemas/image05.png">
</div>

This is the same behavior as in Pydantic v1. 🤓

# Security Tools

When you need to declare dependencies with OAuth2 scopes you use `Security()`.

But you still need to define what is the dependable, the callable that you pass as a parameter to `Depends()` or `Security()`.

There are multiple tools that you can use to create those dependables, and they get integrated into OpenAPI so they are shown in the automatic docs UI, they can be used by automatically generated clients and SDKs, etc.

You can import them from `fastapi.security`:

```python
from fastapi.security import (
    APIKeyCookie,
    APIKeyHeader,
    APIKeyQuery,
    HTTPAuthorizationCredentials,
    HTTPBasic,
    HTTPBasicCredentials,

    OAuth2,
    OAuth2AuthorizationCodeBearer,

# Status Codes

You can import the `status` module from `fastapi`:

```python
from fastapi import status
```

`status` is provided directly by Starlette.

It contains a group of named constants (variables) with integer status codes.

For example:

* 200: `status.HTTP_200_OK`
* 403: `status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN`
* etc.

It can be convenient to quickly access HTTP (and WebSocket) status codes in your app, using autocompletion for the name without having to remember the integer status codes by memory.

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about Response Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/).

## Example

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, status

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/items/", status_code=status.HTTP_418_IM_A_TEAPOT)
def read_items():
    return [{"name": "Plumbus"}, {"name": "Portal Gun"}]

# Classes as Dependencies

Before diving deeper into the **Dependency Injection** system, let's upgrade the previous example.

## A `dict` from the previous example

In the previous example, we were returning a `dict` from our dependency ("dependable"):

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[9] *}

But then we get a `dict` in the parameter `commons` of the *path operation function*.

And we know that editors can't provide a lot of support (like completion) for `dict`s, because they can't know their keys and value types.

We can do better...

## What makes a dependency

Up to now you have seen dependencies declared as functions.

But that's not the only way to declare dependencies (although it would probably be the more common).

The key factor is that a dependency should be a "callable".

A "**callable**" in Python is anything that Python can "call" like a function.

So, if you have an object `something` (that might _not_ be a function) and you can "call" it (execute it) like:

```Python
something()
```

or

```Python
something(some_argument, some_keyword_argument="foo")
```

then it is a "callable".

## Classes as dependencies

You might notice that to create an instance of a Python class, you use that same syntax.

For example:

```Python
class Cat:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name


fluffy = Cat(name="Mr Fluffy")
```

In this case, `fluffy` is an instance of the class `Cat`.

And to create `fluffy`, you are "calling" `Cat`.

So, a Python class is also a **callable**.

Then, in **FastAPI**, you could use a Python class as a dependency.

What FastAPI actually checks is that it is a "callable" (function, class or anything else) and the parameters defined.

If you pass a "callable" as a dependency in **FastAPI**, it will analyze the parameters for that "callable", and process them in the same way as the parameters for a *path operation function*. Including sub-dependencies.

That also applies to callables with no parameters at all. The same as it would be for *path operation functions* with no parameters.

Then, we can change the dependency "dependable" `common_parameters` from above to the class `CommonQueryParams`:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial002_an_py310.py hl[11:15] *}

Pay attention to the `__init__` method used to create the instance of the class:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial002_an_py310.py hl[12] *}

...it has the same parameters as our previous `common_parameters`:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[8] *}

Those parameters are what **FastAPI** will use to "solve" the dependency.

In both cases, it will have:

* An optional `q` query parameter that is a `str`.
* A `skip` query parameter that is an `int`, with a default of `0`.
* A `limit` query parameter that is an `int`, with a default of `100`.

In both cases the data will be converted, validated, documented on the OpenAPI schema, etc.

## Use it

Now you can declare your dependency using this class.

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial002_an_py310.py hl[19] *}

**FastAPI** calls the `CommonQueryParams` class. This creates an "instance" of that class and the instance will be passed as the parameter `commons` to your function.

## Type annotation vs `Depends`

Notice how we write `CommonQueryParams` twice in the above code:

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python
commons: Annotated[CommonQueryParams, Depends(CommonQueryParams)]
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+ non-Annotated

/// tip

Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

///

```Python
commons: CommonQueryParams = Depends(CommonQueryParams)
```

////

The last `CommonQueryParams`, in:

```Python
... Depends(CommonQueryParams)
```

...is what **FastAPI** will actually use to know what is the dependency.

It is from this one that FastAPI will extract the declared parameters and that is what FastAPI will actually call.

---

In this case, the first `CommonQueryParams`, in:

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python
commons: Annotated[CommonQueryParams, ...
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+ non-Annotated

/// tip

Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

///

```Python
commons: CommonQueryParams ...
```

////

...doesn't have any special meaning for **FastAPI**. FastAPI won't use it for data conversion, validation, etc. (as it is using the `Depends(CommonQueryParams)` for that).

You could actually write just:

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python
commons: Annotated[Any, Depends(CommonQueryParams)]
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+ non-Annotated

/// tip

Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

///

```Python
commons = Depends(CommonQueryParams)
```

////

...as in:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial003_an_py310.py hl[19] *}

But declaring the type is encouraged as that way your editor will know what will be passed as the parameter `commons`, and then it can help you with code completion, type checks, etc:

<img src="/img/tutorial/dependencies/image02.png">

## Shortcut

But you see that we are having some code repetition here, writing `CommonQueryParams` twice:

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python
commons: Annotated[CommonQueryParams, Depends(CommonQueryParams)]
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+ non-Annotated

/// tip

Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

///

```Python
commons: CommonQueryParams = Depends(CommonQueryParams)
```

////

**FastAPI** provides a shortcut for these cases, in where the dependency is *specifically* a class that **FastAPI** will "call" to create an instance of the class itself.

For those specific cases, you can do the following:

Instead of writing:

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python
commons: Annotated[CommonQueryParams, Depends(CommonQueryParams)]
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+ non-Annotated

/// tip

Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

///

```Python
commons: CommonQueryParams = Depends(CommonQueryParams)
```

////

...you write:

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python
commons: Annotated[CommonQueryParams, Depends()]
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8 non-Annotated

/// tip

Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

///

```Python
commons: CommonQueryParams = Depends()
```

////

You declare the dependency as the type of the parameter, and you use `Depends()` without any parameter, instead of having to write the full class *again* inside of `Depends(CommonQueryParams)`.

The same example would then look like:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial004_an_py310.py hl[19] *}

...and **FastAPI** will know what to do.

/// tip

If that seems more confusing than helpful, disregard it, you don't *need* it.

It is just a shortcut. Because **FastAPI** cares about helping you minimize code repetition.

# Dependencies in path operation decorators

In some cases you don't really need the return value of a dependency inside your *path operation function*.

Or the dependency doesn't return a value.

But you still need it to be executed/solved.

For those cases, instead of declaring a *path operation function* parameter with `Depends`, you can add a `list` of `dependencies` to the *path operation decorator*.

## Add `dependencies` to the *path operation decorator*

The *path operation decorator* receives an optional argument `dependencies`.

It should be a `list` of `Depends()`:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial006_an_py39.py hl[19] *}

These dependencies will be executed/solved the same way as normal dependencies. But their value (if they return any) won't be passed to your *path operation function*.

/// tip

Some editors check for unused function parameters, and show them as errors.

Using these `dependencies` in the *path operation decorator* you can make sure they are executed while avoiding editor/tooling errors.

It might also help avoid confusion for new developers that see an unused parameter in your code and could think it's unnecessary.

///

/// info

In this example we use invented custom headers `X-Key` and `X-Token`.

But in real cases, when implementing security, you would get more benefits from using the integrated [Security utilities (the next chapter)](../security/index.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

///

## Dependencies errors and return values

You can use the same dependency *functions* you use normally.

### Dependency requirements

They can declare request requirements (like headers) or other sub-dependencies:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial006_an_py39.py hl[8,13] *}

### Raise exceptions

These dependencies can `raise` exceptions, the same as normal dependencies:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial006_an_py39.py hl[10,15] *}

### Return values

And they can return values or not, the values won't be used.

So, you can reuse a normal dependency (that returns a value) you already use somewhere else, and even though the value won't be used, the dependency will be executed:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial006_an_py39.py hl[11,16] *}

## Dependencies for a group of *path operations*

Later, when reading about how to structure bigger applications ([Bigger Applications - Multiple Files](../../tutorial/bigger-applications.md){.internal-link target=_blank}), possibly with multiple files, you will learn how to declare a single `dependencies` parameter for a group of *path operations*.

## Global Dependencies

Next we will see how to add dependencies to the whole `FastAPI` application, so that they apply to each *path operation*.

````markdown
# Dependencies with yield

FastAPI supports dependencies that do some <abbr title='sometimes also called "exit code", "cleanup code", "teardown code", "closing code", "context manager exit code", etc.'>extra steps after finishing</abbr>.

To do this, use `yield` instead of `return`, and write the extra steps (code) after.

/// tip

Make sure to use `yield` one single time per dependency.

///

/// note | Technical Details

Any function that is valid to use with:

* <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager" class="external-link" target="_blank">`@contextlib.contextmanager`</a> or
* <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.asynccontextmanager" class="external-link" target="_blank">`@contextlib.asynccontextmanager`</a>

would be valid to use as a **FastAPI** dependency.

In fact, FastAPI uses those two decorators internally.

///

## A database dependency with `yield`

For example, you could use this to create a database session and close it after finishing.

Only the code prior to and including the `yield` statement is executed before creating a response:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial007.py hl[2:4] *}

The yielded value is what is injected into *path operations* and other dependencies:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial007.py hl[4] *}

The code following the `yield` statement is executed after creating the response but before sending it:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial007.py hl[5:6] *}

/// tip

You can use `async` or regular functions.

**FastAPI** will do the right thing with each, the same as with normal dependencies.

///

## A dependency with `yield` and `try`

If you use a `try` block in a dependency with `yield`, you'll receive any exception that was thrown when using the dependency.

For example, if some code at some point in the middle, in another dependency or in a *path operation*, made a database transaction "rollback" or create any other error, you will receive the exception in your dependency.

So, you can look for that specific exception inside the dependency with `except SomeException`.

In the same way, you can use `finally` to make sure the exit steps are executed, no matter if there was an exception or not.

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial007.py hl[3,5] *}

## Sub-dependencies with `yield`

You can have sub-dependencies and "trees" of sub-dependencies of any size and shape, and any or all of them can use `yield`.

**FastAPI** will make sure that the "exit code" in each dependency with `yield` is run in the correct order.

For example, `dependency_c` can have a dependency on `dependency_b`, and `dependency_b` on `dependency_a`:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial008_an_py39.py hl[6,14,22] *}

And all of them can use `yield`.

In this case `dependency_c`, to execute its exit code, needs the value from `dependency_b` (here named `dep_b`) to still be available.

And, in turn, `dependency_b` needs the value from `dependency_a` (here named `dep_a`) to be available for its exit code.

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial008_an_py39.py hl[18:19,26:27] *}

The same way, you could have some dependencies with `yield` and some other dependencies with `return`, and have some of those depend on some of the others.

And you could have a single dependency that requires several other dependencies with `yield`, etc.

You can have any combinations of dependencies that you want.

**FastAPI** will make sure everything is run in the correct order.

/// note | Technical Details

This works thanks to Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html" class="external-link" target="_blank">Context Managers</a>.

**FastAPI** uses them internally to achieve this.

///

## Dependencies with `yield` and `HTTPException`

You saw that you can use dependencies with `yield` and have `try` blocks that catch exceptions.

The same way, you could raise an `HTTPException` or similar in the exit code, after the `yield`.

/// tip

This is a somewhat advanced technique, and in most of the cases you won't really need it, as you can raise exceptions (including `HTTPException`) from inside of the rest of your application code, for example, in the *path operation function*.

But it's there for you if you need it. 🤓

///

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial008b_an_py39.py hl[18:22,31] *}

An alternative you could use to catch exceptions (and possibly also raise another `HTTPException`) is to create a [Custom Exception Handler](../handling-errors.md#install-custom-exception-handlers){.internal-link target=_blank}.

## Dependencies with `yield` and `except`

If you catch an exception using `except` in a dependency with `yield` and you don't raise it again (or raise a new exception), FastAPI won't be able to notice there was an exception, the same way that would happen with regular Python:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial008c_an_py39.py hl[15:16] *}

In this case, the client will see an *HTTP 500 Internal Server Error* response as it should, given that we are not raising an `HTTPException` or similar, but the server will **not have any logs** or any other indication of what was the error. 😱

### Always `raise` in Dependencies with `yield` and `except`

If you catch an exception in a dependency with `yield`, unless you are raising another `HTTPException` or similar, you should re-raise the original exception.

You can re-raise the same exception using `raise`:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial008d_an_py39.py hl[17] *}

Now the client will get the same *HTTP 500 Internal Server Error* response, but the server will have our custom `InternalError` in the logs. 😎

## Execution of dependencies with `yield`

The sequence of execution is more or less like this diagram. Time flows from top to bottom. And each column is one of the parts interacting or executing code.

```mermaid

participant client as Client
participant handler as Exception handler

    end
    dep ->> operation: Run dependency, e.g. DB session
    opt raise
        operation -->> dep: Raise Exception (e.g. HTTPException)
        opt handle

        end
        handler -->> client: HTTP error response
    end

    operation ->> client: Return response to client
    Note over client,operation: Response is already sent, can't change it anymore
    opt Tasks
        operation -->> tasks: Send background tasks
    end
    opt Raise other exception
        tasks -->> tasks: Handle exceptions in the background task code
    end
```

/// info

Only **one response** will be sent to the client. It might be one of the error responses or it will be the response from the *path operation*.

After one of those responses is sent, no other response can be sent.

///

/// tip

This diagram shows `HTTPException`, but you could also raise any other exception that you catch in a dependency with `yield` or with a [Custom Exception Handler](../handling-errors.md#install-custom-exception-handlers){.internal-link target=_blank}.

If you raise any exception, it will be passed to the dependencies with yield, including `HTTPException`. In most cases you will want to re-raise that same exception or a new one from the dependency with `yield` to make sure it's properly handled.

///

## Dependencies with `yield`, `HTTPException`, `except` and Background Tasks

/// warning

You most probably don't need these technical details, you can skip this section and continue below.

These details are useful mainly if you were using a version of FastAPI prior to 0.106.0 and used resources from dependencies with `yield` in background tasks.

///

### Dependencies with `yield` and `except`, Technical Details

Before FastAPI 0.110.0, if you used a dependency with `yield`, and then you captured an exception with `except` in that dependency, and you didn't raise the exception again, the exception would be automatically raised/forwarded to any exception handlers or the internal server error handler.

This was changed in version 0.110.0 to fix unhandled memory consumption from forwarded exceptions without a handler (internal server errors), and to make it consistent with the behavior of regular Python code.

### Background Tasks and Dependencies with `yield`, Technical Details

Before FastAPI 0.106.0, raising exceptions after `yield` was not possible, the exit code in dependencies with `yield` was executed *after* the response was sent, so [Exception Handlers](../handling-errors.md#install-custom-exception-handlers){.internal-link target=_blank} would have already run.

This was designed this way mainly to allow using the same objects "yielded" by dependencies inside of background tasks, because the exit code would be executed after the background tasks were finished.

Nevertheless, as this would mean waiting for the response to travel through the network while unnecessarily holding a resource in a dependency with yield (for example a database connection), this was changed in FastAPI 0.106.0.

/// tip

Additionally, a background task is normally an independent set of logic that should be handled separately, with its own resources (e.g. its own database connection).

So, this way you will probably have cleaner code.

///

If you used to rely on this behavior, now you should create the resources for background tasks inside the background task itself, and use internally only data that doesn't depend on the resources of dependencies with `yield`.

For example, instead of using the same database session, you would create a new database session inside of the background task, and you would obtain the objects from the database using this new session. And then instead of passing the object from the database as a parameter to the background task function, you would pass the ID of that object and then obtain the object again inside the background task function.

## Context Managers

### What are "Context Managers"

"Context Managers" are any of those Python objects that you can use in a `with` statement.

For example, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" class="external-link" target="_blank">you can use `with` to read a file</a>:

```Python
with open("./somefile.txt") as f:
    contents = f.read()
    print(contents)
```

Underneath, the `open("./somefile.txt")` creates an object that is called a "Context Manager".

When the `with` block finishes, it makes sure to close the file, even if there were exceptions.

When you create a dependency with `yield`, **FastAPI** will internally create a context manager for it, and combine it with some other related tools.

### Using context managers in dependencies with `yield`

/// warning

This is, more or less, an "advanced" idea.

If you are just starting with **FastAPI** you might want to skip it for now.

///

In Python, you can create Context Managers by <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#context-managers" class="external-link" target="_blank">creating a class with two methods: `__enter__()` and `__exit__()`</a>.

You can also use them inside of **FastAPI** dependencies with `yield` by using
`with` or `async with` statements inside of the dependency function:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial010.py hl[1:9,13] *}

/// tip

Another way to create a context manager is with:

* <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager" class="external-link" target="_blank">`@contextlib.contextmanager`</a> or
* <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.asynccontextmanager" class="external-link" target="_blank">`@contextlib.asynccontextmanager`</a>

using them to decorate a function with a single `yield`.

That's what **FastAPI** uses internally for dependencies with `yield`.

But you don't have to use the decorators for FastAPI dependencies (and you shouldn't).

FastAPI will do it for you internally.

# Global Dependencies

For some types of applications you might want to add dependencies to the whole application.

Similar to the way you can [add `dependencies` to the *path operation decorators*](dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, you can add them to the `FastAPI` application.

In that case, they will be applied to all the *path operations* in the application:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial012_an_py39.py hl[16] *}


And all the ideas in the section about [adding `dependencies` to the *path operation decorators*](dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators.md){.internal-link target=_blank} still apply, but in this case, to all of the *path operations* in the app.

## Dependencies for groups of *path operations*

Later, when reading about how to structure bigger applications ([Bigger Applications - Multiple Files](../../tutorial/bigger-applications.md){.internal-link target=_blank}), possibly with multiple files, you will learn how to declare a single `dependencies` parameter for a group of *path operations*.

# Dependencies

**FastAPI** has a very powerful but intuitive **<abbr title="also known as components, resources, providers, services, injectables">Dependency Injection</abbr>** system.

It is designed to be very simple to use, and to make it very easy for any developer to integrate other components with **FastAPI**.

## What is "Dependency Injection"

**"Dependency Injection"** means, in programming, that there is a way for your code (in this case, your *path operation functions*) to declare things that it requires to work and use: "dependencies".

And then, that system (in this case **FastAPI**) will take care of doing whatever is needed to provide your code with those needed dependencies ("inject" the dependencies).

This is very useful when you need to:

* Have shared logic (the same code logic again and again).
* Share database connections.
* Enforce security, authentication, role requirements, etc.
* And many other things...

All these, while minimizing code repetition.

## First Steps

Let's see a very simple example. It will be so simple that it is not very useful, for now.

But this way we can focus on how the **Dependency Injection** system works.

### Create a dependency, or "dependable"

Let's first focus on the dependency.

It is just a function that can take all the same parameters that a *path operation function* can take:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[8:9] *}

That's it.

**2 lines**.

And it has the same shape and structure that all your *path operation functions* have.

You can think of it as a *path operation function* without the "decorator" (without the `@app.get("/some-path")`).

And it can return anything you want.

In this case, this dependency expects:

* An optional query parameter `q` that is a `str`.
* An optional query parameter `skip` that is an `int`, and by default is `0`.
* An optional query parameter `limit` that is an `int`, and by default is `100`.

And then it just returns a `dict` containing those values.

/// info

FastAPI added support for `Annotated` (and started recommending it) in version 0.95.0.

If you have an older version, you would get errors when trying to use `Annotated`.

Make sure you [Upgrade the FastAPI version](../../deployment/versions.md#upgrading-the-fastapi-versions){.internal-link target=_blank} to at least 0.95.1 before using `Annotated`.

///

### Import `Depends`

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[3] *}

### Declare the dependency, in the "dependant"

The same way you use `Body`, `Query`, etc. with your *path operation function* parameters, use `Depends` with a new parameter:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[13,18] *}

Although you use `Depends` in the parameters of your function the same way you use `Body`, `Query`, etc, `Depends` works a bit differently.

You only give `Depends` a single parameter.

This parameter must be something like a function.

You **don't call it** directly (don't add the parenthesis at the end), you just pass it as a parameter to `Depends()`.

And that function takes parameters in the same way that *path operation functions* do.

/// tip

You'll see what other "things", apart from functions, can be used as dependencies in the next chapter.

///

Whenever a new request arrives, **FastAPI** will take care of:

* Calling your dependency ("dependable") function with the correct parameters.
* Get the result from your function.
* Assign that result to the parameter in your *path operation function*.

```mermaid
graph TB

common_parameters(["common_parameters"])
read_items["/items/"]
read_users["/users/"]

common_parameters --> read_items
common_parameters --> read_users
```

This way you write shared code once and **FastAPI** takes care of calling it for your *path operations*.

/// check

Notice that you don't have to create a special class and pass it somewhere to **FastAPI** to "register" it or anything similar.

You just pass it to `Depends` and **FastAPI** knows how to do the rest.

///

## Share `Annotated` dependencies

In the examples above, you see that there's a tiny bit of **code duplication**.

When you need to use the `common_parameters()` dependency, you have to write the whole parameter with the type annotation and `Depends()`:

```Python
commons: Annotated[dict, Depends(common_parameters)]
```

But because we are using `Annotated`, we can store that `Annotated` value in a variable and use it in multiple places:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial001_02_an_py310.py hl[12,16,21] *}

/// tip

This is just standard Python, it's called a "type alias", it's actually not specific to **FastAPI**.

But because **FastAPI** is based on the Python standards, including `Annotated`, you can use this trick in your code. 😎

///

The dependencies will keep working as expected, and the **best part** is that the **type information will be preserved**, which means that your editor will be able to keep providing you with **autocompletion**, **inline errors**, etc. The same for other tools like `mypy`.

This will be especially useful when you use it in a **large code base** where you use **the same dependencies** over and over again in **many *path operations***.

## To `async` or not to `async`

As dependencies will also be called by **FastAPI** (the same as your *path operation functions*), the same rules apply while defining your functions.

You can use `async def` or normal `def`.

And you can declare dependencies with `async def` inside of normal `def` *path operation functions*, or `def` dependencies inside of `async def` *path operation functions*, etc.

It doesn't matter. **FastAPI** will know what to do.

/// note

If you don't know, check the [Async: *"In a hurry?"*](../../async.md#in-a-hurry){.internal-link target=_blank} section about `async` and `await` in the docs.

///

## Integrated with OpenAPI

All the request declarations, validations and requirements of your dependencies (and sub-dependencies) will be integrated in the same OpenAPI schema.

So, the interactive docs will have all the information from these dependencies too:

<img src="/img/tutorial/dependencies/image01.png">

## Simple usage

If you look at it, *path operation functions* are declared to be used whenever a *path* and *operation* matches, and then **FastAPI** takes care of calling the function with the correct parameters, extracting the data from the request.

Actually, all (or most) of the web frameworks work in this same way.

You never call those functions directly. They are called by your framework (in this case, **FastAPI**).

With the Dependency Injection system, you can also tell **FastAPI** that your *path operation function* also "depends" on something else that should be executed before your *path operation function*, and **FastAPI** will take care of executing it and "injecting" the results.

Other common terms for this same idea of "dependency injection" are:

* resources
* providers
* services
* injectables
* components

## **FastAPI** plug-ins

Integrations and "plug-ins" can be built using the **Dependency Injection** system. But in fact, there is actually **no need to create "plug-ins"**, as by using dependencies it's possible to declare an infinite number of integrations and interactions that become available to your *path operation functions*.

And dependencies can be created in a very simple and intuitive way that allows you to just import the Python packages you need, and integrate them with your API functions in a couple of lines of code, *literally*.

You will see examples of this in the next chapters, about relational and NoSQL databases, security, etc.

## **FastAPI** compatibility

The simplicity of the dependency injection system makes **FastAPI** compatible with:

* all the relational databases
* NoSQL databases
* external packages
* external APIs
* authentication and authorization systems
* API usage monitoring systems
* response data injection systems
* etc.

## Simple and Powerful

Although the hierarchical dependency injection system is very simple to define and use, it's still very powerful.

You can define dependencies that in turn can define dependencies themselves.

In the end, a hierarchical tree of dependencies is built, and the **Dependency Injection** system takes care of solving all these dependencies for you (and their sub-dependencies) and providing (injecting) the results at each step.

For example, let's say you have 4 API endpoints (*path operations*):

* `/items/public/`
* `/items/private/`
* `/users/{user_id}/activate`
* `/items/pro/`

then you could add different permission requirements for each of them just with dependencies and sub-dependencies:

```mermaid
graph TB

current_user(["current_user"])
active_user(["active_user"])
admin_user(["admin_user"])
paying_user(["paying_user"])

public["/items/public/"]
private["/items/private/"]
activate_user["/users/{user_id}/activate"]
pro_items["/items/pro/"]

current_user --> active_user
active_user --> admin_user
active_user --> paying_user

current_user --> public
active_user --> private
admin_user --> activate_user
paying_user --> pro_items
```

## Integrated with **OpenAPI**

All these dependencies, while declaring their requirements, also add parameters, validations, etc. to your *path operations*.

**FastAPI** will take care of adding it all to the OpenAPI schema, so that it is shown in the interactive documentation systems.
````

## File: docs/en/docs/tutorial/dependencies/sub-dependencies.md
````markdown
# Sub-dependencies

You can create dependencies that have **sub-dependencies**.

They can be as **deep** as you need them to be.

**FastAPI** will take care of solving them.

## First dependency "dependable"

You could create a first dependency ("dependable") like:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial005_an_py310.py hl[8:9] *}

It declares an optional query parameter `q` as a `str`, and then it just returns it.

This is quite simple (not very useful), but will help us focus on how the sub-dependencies work.

## Second dependency, "dependable" and "dependant"

Then you can create another dependency function (a "dependable") that at the same time declares a dependency of its own (so it is a "dependant" too):

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial005_an_py310.py hl[13] *}

Let's focus on the parameters declared:

* Even though this function is a dependency ("dependable") itself, it also declares another dependency (it "depends" on something else).
    * It depends on the `query_extractor`, and assigns the value returned by it to the parameter `q`.
* It also declares an optional `last_query` cookie, as a `str`.
    * If the user didn't provide any query `q`, we use the last query used, which we saved to a cookie before.

## Use the dependency

Then we can use the dependency with:

{* ../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial005_an_py310.py hl[23] *}

/// info

Notice that we are only declaring one dependency in the *path operation function*, the `query_or_cookie_extractor`.

But **FastAPI** will know that it has to solve `query_extractor` first, to pass the results of that to `query_or_cookie_extractor` while calling it.

///

```mermaid
graph TB

query_extractor(["query_extractor"])
query_or_cookie_extractor(["query_or_cookie_extractor"])

read_query["/items/"]

query_extractor --> query_or_cookie_extractor --> read_query
```

## Using the same dependency multiple times

If one of your dependencies is declared multiple times for the same *path operation*, for example, multiple dependencies have a common sub-dependency, **FastAPI** will know to call that sub-dependency only once per request.

And it will save the returned value in a <abbr title="A utility/system to store computed/generated values, to reuse them instead of computing them again.">"cache"</abbr> and pass it to all the "dependants" that need it in that specific request, instead of calling the dependency multiple times for the same request.

In an advanced scenario where you know you need the dependency to be called at every step (possibly multiple times) in the same request instead of using the "cached" value, you can set the parameter `use_cache=False` when using `Depends`:

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python hl_lines="1"
async def needy_dependency(fresh_value: Annotated[str, Depends(get_value, use_cache=False)]):
    return {"fresh_value": fresh_value}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+ non-Annotated

/// tip

Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

///

```Python hl_lines="1"
async def needy_dependency(fresh_value: str = Depends(get_value, use_cache=False)):
    return {"fresh_value": fresh_value}
```

////

## Recap

Apart from all the fancy words used here, the **Dependency Injection** system is quite simple.

Just functions that look the same as the *path operation functions*.

But still, it is very powerful, and allows you to declare arbitrarily deeply nested dependency "graphs" (trees).

/// tip

All this might not seem as useful with these simple examples.

But you will see how useful it is in the chapters about **security**.

And you will also see the amounts of code it will save you.

# Security - First Steps

Let's imagine that you have your **backend** API in some domain.

And you have a **frontend** in another domain or in a different path of the same domain (or in a mobile application).

And you want to have a way for the frontend to authenticate with the backend, using a **username** and **password**.

We can use **OAuth2** to build that with **FastAPI**.

But let's save you the time of reading the full long specification just to find those little pieces of information you need.

Let's use the tools provided by **FastAPI** to handle security.

## How it looks

Let's first just use the code and see how it works, and then we'll come back to understand what's happening.

## Create `main.py`

Copy the example in a file `main.py`:

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial001_an_py39.py *}

## Run it

/// info

The <a href="https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart" class="external-link" target="_blank">`python-multipart`</a> package is automatically installed with **FastAPI** when you run the `pip install "fastapi[standard]"` command.

However, if you use the `pip install fastapi` command, the `python-multipart` package is not included by default.

To install it manually, make sure you create a [virtual environment](../../virtual-environments.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, activate it, and then install it with:

```console
$ pip install python-multipart
```

This is because **OAuth2** uses "form data" for sending the `username` and `password`.

///

Run the example with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ fastapi dev main.py

<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

</div>

## Check it

Go to the interactive docs at: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>.

You will see something like this:

<img src="/img/tutorial/security/image01.png">

/// check | Authorize button!

You already have a shiny new "Authorize" button.

And your *path operation* has a little lock in the top-right corner that you can click.

///

And if you click it, you have a little authorization form to type a `username` and `password` (and other optional fields):

<img src="/img/tutorial/security/image02.png">

/// note

It doesn't matter what you type in the form, it won't work yet. But we'll get there.

///

This is of course not the frontend for the final users, but it's a great automatic tool to document interactively all your API.

It can be used by the frontend team (that can also be yourself).

It can be used by third party applications and systems.

And it can also be used by yourself, to debug, check and test the same application.

## The `password` flow

Now let's go back a bit and understand what is all that.

The `password` "flow" is one of the ways ("flows") defined in OAuth2, to handle security and authentication.

OAuth2 was designed so that the backend or API could be independent of the server that authenticates the user.

But in this case, the same **FastAPI** application will handle the API and the authentication.

So, let's review it from that simplified point of view:

* The user types the `username` and `password` in the frontend, and hits `Enter`.
* The frontend (running in the user's browser) sends that `username` and `password` to a specific URL in our API (declared with `tokenUrl="token"`).
* The API checks that `username` and `password`, and responds with a "token" (we haven't implemented any of this yet).
    * A "token" is just a string with some content that we can use later to verify this user.
    * Normally, a token is set to expire after some time.
        * So, the user will have to log in again at some point later.
        * And if the token is stolen, the risk is less. It is not like a permanent key that will work forever (in most of the cases).
* The frontend stores that token temporarily somewhere.
* The user clicks in the frontend to go to another section of the frontend web app.
* The frontend needs to fetch some more data from the API.
    * But it needs authentication for that specific endpoint.
    * So, to authenticate with our API, it sends a header `Authorization` with a value of `Bearer ` plus the token.
    * If the token contains `foobar`, the content of the `Authorization` header would be: `Bearer foobar`.

## **FastAPI**'s `OAuth2PasswordBearer`

**FastAPI** provides several tools, at different levels of abstraction, to implement these security features.

In this example we are going to use **OAuth2**, with the **Password** flow, using a **Bearer** token. We do that using the `OAuth2PasswordBearer` class.

/// info

A "bearer" token is not the only option.

But it's the best one for our use case.

And it might be the best for most use cases, unless you are an OAuth2 expert and know exactly why there's another option that better suits your needs.

In that case, **FastAPI** also provides you with the tools to build it.

///

When we create an instance of the `OAuth2PasswordBearer` class we pass in the `tokenUrl` parameter. This parameter contains the URL that the client (the frontend running in the user's browser) will use to send the `username` and `password` in order to get a token.

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial001_an_py39.py hl[8] *}

/// tip

Here `tokenUrl="token"` refers to a relative URL `token` that we haven't created yet. As it's a relative URL, it's equivalent to `./token`.

Because we are using a relative URL, if your API was located at `https://example.com/`, then it would refer to `https://example.com/token`. But if your API was located at `https://example.com/api/v1/`, then it would refer to `https://example.com/api/v1/token`.

Using a relative URL is important to make sure your application keeps working even in an advanced use case like [Behind a Proxy](../../advanced/behind-a-proxy.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

///

This parameter doesn't create that endpoint / *path operation*, but declares that the URL `/token` will be the one that the client should use to get the token. That information is used in OpenAPI, and then in the interactive API documentation systems.

We will soon also create the actual path operation.

/// info

If you are a very strict "Pythonista" you might dislike the style of the parameter name `tokenUrl` instead of `token_url`.

That's because it is using the same name as in the OpenAPI spec. So that if you need to investigate more about any of these security schemes you can just copy and paste it to find more information about it.

///

The `oauth2_scheme` variable is an instance of `OAuth2PasswordBearer`, but it is also a "callable".

It could be called as:

```Python
oauth2_scheme(some, parameters)
```

So, it can be used with `Depends`.

### Use it

Now you can pass that `oauth2_scheme` in a dependency with `Depends`.

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial001_an_py39.py hl[12] *}

This dependency will provide a `str` that is assigned to the parameter `token` of the *path operation function*.

**FastAPI** will know that it can use this dependency to define a "security scheme" in the OpenAPI schema (and the automatic API docs).

/// info | Technical Details

**FastAPI** will know that it can use the class `OAuth2PasswordBearer` (declared in a dependency) to define the security scheme in OpenAPI because it inherits from `fastapi.security.oauth2.OAuth2`, which in turn inherits from `fastapi.security.base.SecurityBase`.

All the security utilities that integrate with OpenAPI (and the automatic API docs) inherit from `SecurityBase`, that's how **FastAPI** can know how to integrate them in OpenAPI.

///

## What it does

It will go and look in the request for that `Authorization` header, check if the value is `Bearer ` plus some token, and will return the token as a `str`.

If it doesn't see an `Authorization` header, or the value doesn't have a `Bearer ` token, it will respond with a 401 status code error (`UNAUTHORIZED`) directly.

You don't even have to check if the token exists to return an error. You can be sure that if your function is executed, it will have a `str` in that token.

You can try it already in the interactive docs:

<img src="/img/tutorial/security/image03.png">

We are not verifying the validity of the token yet, but that's a start already.

## Recap

So, in just 3 or 4 extra lines, you already have some primitive form of security.
````

## File: docs/en/docs/tutorial/security/get-current-user.md
````markdown
# Get Current User

In the previous chapter the security system (which is based on the dependency injection system) was giving the *path operation function* a `token` as a `str`:

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial001_an_py39.py hl[12] *}

But that is still not that useful.

Let's make it give us the current user.

## Create a user model

First, let's create a Pydantic user model.

The same way we use Pydantic to declare bodies, we can use it anywhere else:

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial002_an_py310.py hl[5,12:6] *}

## Create a `get_current_user` dependency

Let's create a dependency `get_current_user`.

Remember that dependencies can have sub-dependencies?

`get_current_user` will have a dependency with the same `oauth2_scheme` we created before.

The same as we were doing before in the *path operation* directly, our new dependency `get_current_user` will receive a `token` as a `str` from the sub-dependency `oauth2_scheme`:

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial002_an_py310.py hl[25] *}

## Get the user

`get_current_user` will use a (fake) utility function we created, that takes a token as a `str` and returns our Pydantic `User` model:

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial002_an_py310.py hl[19:22,26:27] *}

## Inject the current user

So now we can use the same `Depends` with our `get_current_user` in the *path operation*:

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial002_an_py310.py hl[31] *}

Notice that we declare the type of `current_user` as the Pydantic model `User`.

This will help us inside of the function with all the completion and type checks.

/// tip

You might remember that request bodies are also declared with Pydantic models.

Here **FastAPI** won't get confused because you are using `Depends`.

///

/// check

The way this dependency system is designed allows us to have different dependencies (different "dependables") that all return a `User` model.

We are not restricted to having only one dependency that can return that type of data.

///

## Other models

You can now get the current user directly in the *path operation functions* and deal with the security mechanisms at the **Dependency Injection** level, using `Depends`.

And you can use any model or data for the security requirements (in this case, a Pydantic model `User`).

But you are not restricted to using some specific data model, class or type.

Do you want to have an `id` and `email` and not have any `username` in your model? Sure. You can use these same tools.

Do you want to just have a `str`? Or just a `dict`? Or a database class model instance directly? It all works the same way.

You actually don't have users that log in to your application but robots, bots, or other systems, that have just an access token? Again, it all works the same.

Just use any kind of model, any kind of class, any kind of database that you need for your application. **FastAPI** has you covered with the dependency injection system.

## Code size

This example might seem verbose. Keep in mind that we are mixing security, data models, utility functions and *path operations* in the same file.

But here's the key point.

The security and dependency injection stuff is written once.

And you can make it as complex as you want. And still, have it written only once, in a single place. With all the flexibility.

But you can have thousands of endpoints (*path operations*) using the same security system.

And all of them (or any portion of them that you want) can take advantage of re-using these dependencies or any other dependencies you create.

And all these thousands of *path operations* can be as small as 3 lines:

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial002_an_py310.py hl[30:32] *}

## Recap

You can now get the current user directly in your *path operation function*.

We are already halfway there.

We just need to add a *path operation* for the user/client to actually send the `username` and `password`.

That comes next.

# Security

There are many ways to handle security, authentication and authorization.

And it normally is a complex and "difficult" topic.

In many frameworks and systems just handling security and authentication takes a big amount of effort and code (in many cases it can be 50% or more of all the code written).

**FastAPI** provides several tools to help you deal with **Security** easily, rapidly, in a standard way, without having to study and learn all the security specifications.

But first, let's check some small concepts.

## In a hurry?

If you don't care about any of these terms and you just need to add security with authentication based on username and password *right now*, skip to the next chapters.

## OAuth2

OAuth2 is a specification that defines several ways to handle authentication and authorization.

It is quite an extensive specification and covers several complex use cases.

It includes ways to authenticate using a "third party".

That's what all the systems with "login with Facebook, Google, Twitter, GitHub" use underneath.

### OAuth 1

There was an OAuth 1, which is very different from OAuth2, and more complex, as it included direct specifications on how to encrypt the communication.

It is not very popular or used nowadays.

OAuth2 doesn't specify how to encrypt the communication, it expects you to have your application served with HTTPS.

/// tip

In the section about **deployment** you will see how to set up HTTPS for free, using Traefik and Let's Encrypt.

///

## OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect is another specification, based on **OAuth2**.

It just extends OAuth2 specifying some things that are relatively ambiguous in OAuth2, to try to make it more interoperable.

For example, Google login uses OpenID Connect (which underneath uses OAuth2).

But Facebook login doesn't support OpenID Connect. It has its own flavor of OAuth2.

### OpenID (not "OpenID Connect")

There was also an "OpenID" specification. That tried to solve the same thing as **OpenID Connect**, but was not based on OAuth2.

So, it was a complete additional system.

It is not very popular or used nowadays.

## OpenAPI

OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) is the open specification for building APIs (now part of the Linux Foundation).

**FastAPI** is based on **OpenAPI**.

That's what makes it possible to have multiple automatic interactive documentation interfaces, code generation, etc.

OpenAPI has a way to define multiple security "schemes".

By using them, you can take advantage of all these standard-based tools, including these interactive documentation systems.

OpenAPI defines the following security schemes:

* `apiKey`: an application specific key that can come from:
    * A query parameter.
    * A header.
    * A cookie.
* `http`: standard HTTP authentication systems, including:
    * `bearer`: a header `Authorization` with a value of `Bearer ` plus a token. This is inherited from OAuth2.
    * HTTP Basic authentication.
    * HTTP Digest, etc.
* `oauth2`: all the OAuth2 ways to handle security (called "flows").
    * Several of these flows are appropriate for building an OAuth 2.0 authentication provider (like Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, etc):
        * `implicit`
        * `clientCredentials`
        * `authorizationCode`
    * But there is one specific "flow" that can be perfectly used for handling authentication in the same application directly:
        * `password`: some next chapters will cover examples of this.
* `openIdConnect`: has a way to define how to discover OAuth2 authentication data automatically.
    * This automatic discovery is what is defined in the OpenID Connect specification.


/// tip

Integrating other authentication/authorization providers like Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, etc. is also possible and relatively easy.

The most complex problem is building an authentication/authorization provider like those, but **FastAPI** gives you the tools to do it easily, while doing the heavy lifting for you.

///

## **FastAPI** utilities

FastAPI provides several tools for each of these security schemes in the `fastapi.security` module that simplify using these security mechanisms.

In the next chapters you will see how to add security to your API using those tools provided by **FastAPI**.

And you will also see how it gets automatically integrated into the interactive documentation system.

# OAuth2 with Password (and hashing), Bearer with JWT tokens

Now that we have all the security flow, let's make the application actually secure, using <abbr title="JSON Web Tokens">JWT</abbr> tokens and secure password hashing.

This code is something you can actually use in your application, save the password hashes in your database, etc.

We are going to start from where we left in the previous chapter and increment it.

## About JWT

JWT means "JSON Web Tokens".

It's a standard to codify a JSON object in a long dense string without spaces. It looks like this:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

It is not encrypted, so, anyone could recover the information from the contents.

But it's signed. So, when you receive a token that you emitted, you can verify that you actually emitted it.

That way, you can create a token with an expiration of, let's say, 1 week. And then when the user comes back the next day with the token, you know that user is still logged in to your system.

After a week, the token will be expired and the user will not be authorized and will have to sign in again to get a new token. And if the user (or a third party) tried to modify the token to change the expiration, you would be able to discover it, because the signatures would not match.

If you want to play with JWT tokens and see how they work, check <a href="https://jwt.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://jwt.io</a>.

## Install `PyJWT`

We need to install `PyJWT` to generate and verify the JWT tokens in Python.

Make sure you create a [virtual environment](../../virtual-environments.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, activate it, and then install `pyjwt`:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install pyjwt

---> 100%
```

</div>

/// info

If you are planning to use digital signature algorithms like RSA or ECDSA, you should install the cryptography library dependency `pyjwt[crypto]`.

You can read more about it in the <a href="https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html" class="external-link" target="_blank">PyJWT Installation docs</a>.

///

## Password hashing

"Hashing" means converting some content (a password in this case) into a sequence of bytes (just a string) that looks like gibberish.

Whenever you pass exactly the same content (exactly the same password) you get exactly the same gibberish.

But you cannot convert from the gibberish back to the password.

### Why use password hashing

If your database is stolen, the thief won't have your users' plaintext passwords, only the hashes.

So, the thief won't be able to try to use that password in another system (as many users use the same password everywhere, this would be dangerous).

## Install `passlib`

PassLib is a great Python package to handle password hashes.

It supports many secure hashing algorithms and utilities to work with them.

The recommended algorithm is "Bcrypt".

Make sure you create a [virtual environment](../../virtual-environments.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, activate it, and then install PassLib with Bcrypt:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install "passlib[bcrypt]"

---> 100%
```

</div>

/// tip

With `passlib`, you could even configure it to be able to read passwords created by **Django**, a **Flask** security plug-in or many others.

So, you would be able to, for example, share the same data from a Django application in a database with a FastAPI application. Or gradually migrate a Django application using the same database.

And your users would be able to login from your Django app or from your **FastAPI** app, at the same time.

///

## Hash and verify the passwords

Import the tools we need from `passlib`.

Create a PassLib "context". This is what will be used to hash and verify passwords.

/// tip

The PassLib context also has functionality to use different hashing algorithms, including deprecated old ones only to allow verifying them, etc.

For example, you could use it to read and verify passwords generated by another system (like Django) but hash any new passwords with a different algorithm like Bcrypt.

And be compatible with all of them at the same time.

///

Create a utility function to hash a password coming from the user.

And another utility to verify if a received password matches the hash stored.

And another one to authenticate and return a user.

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial004_an_py310.py hl[8,49,56:57,60:61,70:76] *}

/// note

If you check the new (fake) database `fake_users_db`, you will see how the hashed password looks like now: `"$2b$12$EixZaYVK1fsbw1ZfbX3OXePaWxn96p36WQoeG6Lruj3vjPGga31lW"`.

///

## Handle JWT tokens

Import the modules installed.

Create a random secret key that will be used to sign the JWT tokens.

To generate a secure random secret key use the command:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ openssl rand -hex 32

09d25e094faa6ca2556c818166b7a9563b93f7099f6f0f4caa6cf63b88e8d3e7
```

</div>

And copy the output to the variable `SECRET_KEY` (don't use the one in the example).

Create a variable `ALGORITHM` with the algorithm used to sign the JWT token and set it to `"HS256"`.

Create a variable for the expiration of the token.

Define a Pydantic Model that will be used in the token endpoint for the response.

Create a utility function to generate a new access token.

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial004_an_py310.py hl[4,7,13:15,29:31,79:87] *}

## Update the dependencies

Update `get_current_user` to receive the same token as before, but this time, using JWT tokens.

Decode the received token, verify it, and return the current user.

If the token is invalid, return an HTTP error right away.

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial004_an_py310.py hl[90:107] *}

## Update the `/token` *path operation*

Create a `timedelta` with the expiration time of the token.

Create a real JWT access token and return it.

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial004_an_py310.py hl[118:133] *}

### Technical details about the JWT "subject" `sub`

The JWT specification says that there's a key `sub`, with the subject of the token.

It's optional to use it, but that's where you would put the user's identification, so we are using it here.

JWT might be used for other things apart from identifying a user and allowing them to perform operations directly on your API.

For example, you could identify a "car" or a "blog post".

Then you could add permissions about that entity, like "drive" (for the car) or "edit" (for the blog).

And then, you could give that JWT token to a user (or bot), and they could use it to perform those actions (drive the car, or edit the blog post) without even needing to have an account, just with the JWT token your API generated for that.

Using these ideas, JWT can be used for way more sophisticated scenarios.

In those cases, several of those entities could have the same ID, let's say `foo` (a user `foo`, a car `foo`, and a blog post `foo`).

So, to avoid ID collisions, when creating the JWT token for the user, you could prefix the value of the `sub` key, e.g. with `username:`. So, in this example, the value of `sub` could have been: `username:johndoe`.

The important thing to keep in mind is that the `sub` key should have a unique identifier across the entire application, and it should be a string.

## Check it

Run the server and go to the docs: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>.

You'll see the user interface like:

<img src="/img/tutorial/security/image07.png">

Authorize the application the same way as before.

Using the credentials:

Username: `johndoe`
Password: `secret`

/// check

Notice that nowhere in the code is the plaintext password "`secret`", we only have the hashed version.

///

<img src="/img/tutorial/security/image08.png">

Call the endpoint `/users/me/`, you will get the response as:

```JSON
{
  "username": "johndoe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "full_name": "John Doe",
  "disabled": false
}
```

<img src="/img/tutorial/security/image09.png">

If you open the developer tools, you could see how the data sent only includes the token, the password is only sent in the first request to authenticate the user and get that access token, but not afterwards:

<img src="/img/tutorial/security/image10.png">

/// note

Notice the header `Authorization`, with a value that starts with `Bearer `.

///

## Advanced usage with `scopes`

OAuth2 has the notion of "scopes".

You can use them to add a specific set of permissions to a JWT token.

Then you can give this token to a user directly or a third party, to interact with your API with a set of restrictions.

You can learn how to use them and how they are integrated into **FastAPI** later in the **Advanced User Guide**.

## Recap

With what you have seen up to now, you can set up a secure **FastAPI** application using standards like OAuth2 and JWT.

In almost any framework handling the security becomes a rather complex subject quite quickly.

Many packages that simplify it a lot have to make many compromises with the data model, database, and available features. And some of these packages that simplify things too much actually have security flaws underneath.

---

**FastAPI** doesn't make any compromise with any database, data model or tool.

It gives you all the flexibility to choose the ones that fit your project the best.

And you can use directly many well maintained and widely used packages like `passlib` and `PyJWT`, because **FastAPI** doesn't require any complex mechanisms to integrate external packages.

But it provides you the tools to simplify the process as much as possible without compromising flexibility, robustness, or security.

And you can use and implement secure, standard protocols, like OAuth2 in a relatively simple way.

You can learn more in the **Advanced User Guide** about how to use OAuth2 "scopes", for a more fine-grained permission system, following these same standards. OAuth2 with scopes is the mechanism used by many big authentication providers, like Facebook, Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Twitter, etc. to authorize third party applications to interact with their APIs on behalf of their users.

# Simple OAuth2 with Password and Bearer

Now let's build from the previous chapter and add the missing parts to have a complete security flow.

## Get the `username` and `password`

We are going to use **FastAPI** security utilities to get the `username` and `password`.

OAuth2 specifies that when using the "password flow" (that we are using) the client/user must send a `username` and `password` fields as form data.

And the spec says that the fields have to be named like that. So `user-name` or `email` wouldn't work.

But don't worry, you can show it as you wish to your final users in the frontend.

And your database models can use any other names you want.

But for the login *path operation*, we need to use these names to be compatible with the spec (and be able to, for example, use the integrated API documentation system).

The spec also states that the `username` and `password` must be sent as form data (so, no JSON here).

### `scope`

The spec also says that the client can send another form field "`scope`".

The form field name is `scope` (in singular), but it is actually a long string with "scopes" separated by spaces.

Each "scope" is just a string (without spaces).

They are normally used to declare specific security permissions, for example:

* `users:read` or `users:write` are common examples.
* `instagram_basic` is used by Facebook / Instagram.
* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` is used by Google.

/// info

In OAuth2 a "scope" is just a string that declares a specific permission required.

It doesn't matter if it has other characters like `:` or if it is a URL.

Those details are implementation specific.

For OAuth2 they are just strings.

///

## Code to get the `username` and `password`

Now let's use the utilities provided by **FastAPI** to handle this.

### `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm`

First, import `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm`, and use it as a dependency with `Depends` in the *path operation* for `/token`:

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial003_an_py310.py hl[4,78] *}

`OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` is a class dependency that declares a form body with:

* The `username`.
* The `password`.
* An optional `scope` field as a big string, composed of strings separated by spaces.
* An optional `grant_type`.

/// tip

The OAuth2 spec actually *requires* a field `grant_type` with a fixed value of `password`, but `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` doesn't enforce it.

If you need to enforce it, use `OAuth2PasswordRequestFormStrict` instead of `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm`.

///

* An optional `client_id` (we don't need it for our example).
* An optional `client_secret` (we don't need it for our example).

/// info

The `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` is not a special class for **FastAPI** as is `OAuth2PasswordBearer`.

`OAuth2PasswordBearer` makes **FastAPI** know that it is a security scheme. So it is added that way to OpenAPI.

But `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` is just a class dependency that you could have written yourself, or you could have declared `Form` parameters directly.

But as it's a common use case, it is provided by **FastAPI** directly, just to make it easier.

///

### Use the form data

/// tip

The instance of the dependency class `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` won't have an attribute `scope` with the long string separated by spaces, instead, it will have a `scopes` attribute with the actual list of strings for each scope sent.

We are not using `scopes` in this example, but the functionality is there if you need it.

///

Now, get the user data from the (fake) database, using the `username` from the form field.

If there is no such user, we return an error saying "Incorrect username or password".

For the error, we use the exception `HTTPException`:

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial003_an_py310.py hl[3,79:81] *}

### Check the password

At this point we have the user data from our database, but we haven't checked the password.

Let's put that data in the Pydantic `UserInDB` model first.

You should never save plaintext passwords, so, we'll use the (fake) password hashing system.

If the passwords don't match, we return the same error.

#### Password hashing

"Hashing" means: converting some content (a password in this case) into a sequence of bytes (just a string) that looks like gibberish.

Whenever you pass exactly the same content (exactly the same password) you get exactly the same gibberish.

But you cannot convert from the gibberish back to the password.

##### Why use password hashing

If your database is stolen, the thief won't have your users' plaintext passwords, only the hashes.

So, the thief won't be able to try to use those same passwords in another system (as many users use the same password everywhere, this would be dangerous).

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial003_an_py310.py hl[82:85] *}

#### About `**user_dict`

`UserInDB(**user_dict)` means:

*Pass the keys and values of the `user_dict` directly as key-value arguments, equivalent to:*

```Python
UserInDB(
    username = user_dict["username"],
    email = user_dict["email"],
    full_name = user_dict["full_name"],
    disabled = user_dict["disabled"],
    hashed_password = user_dict["hashed_password"],
)
```

/// info

For a more complete explanation of `**user_dict` check back in [the documentation for **Extra Models**](../extra-models.md#about-user_indict){.internal-link target=_blank}.

///

## Return the token

The response of the `token` endpoint must be a JSON object.

It should have a `token_type`. In our case, as we are using "Bearer" tokens, the token type should be "`bearer`".

And it should have an `access_token`, with a string containing our access token.

For this simple example, we are going to just be completely insecure and return the same `username` as the token.

/// tip

In the next chapter, you will see a real secure implementation, with password hashing and <abbr title="JSON Web Tokens">JWT</abbr> tokens.

But for now, let's focus on the specific details we need.

///

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial003_an_py310.py hl[87] *}

/// tip

By the spec, you should return a JSON with an `access_token` and a `token_type`, the same as in this example.

This is something that you have to do yourself in your code, and make sure you use those JSON keys.

It's almost the only thing that you have to remember to do correctly yourself, to be compliant with the specifications.

For the rest, **FastAPI** handles it for you.

///

## Update the dependencies

Now we are going to update our dependencies.

We want to get the `current_user` *only* if this user is active.

So, we create an additional dependency `get_current_active_user` that in turn uses `get_current_user` as a dependency.

Both of these dependencies will just return an HTTP error if the user doesn't exist, or if is inactive.

So, in our endpoint, we will only get a user if the user exists, was correctly authenticated, and is active:

{* ../../docs_src/security/tutorial003_an_py310.py hl[58:66,69:74,94] *}

/// info

The additional header `WWW-Authenticate` with value `Bearer` we are returning here is also part of the spec.

Any HTTP (error) status code 401 "UNAUTHORIZED" is supposed to also return a `WWW-Authenticate` header.

In the case of bearer tokens (our case), the value of that header should be `Bearer`.

You can actually skip that extra header and it would still work.

But it's provided here to be compliant with the specifications.

Also, there might be tools that expect and use it (now or in the future) and that might be useful for you or your users, now or in the future.

That's the benefit of standards...

///

## See it in action

Open the interactive docs: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>.

### Authenticate

Click the "Authorize" button.

Use the credentials:

User: `johndoe`

Password: `secret`

<img src="/img/tutorial/security/image04.png">

After authenticating in the system, you will see it like:

<img src="/img/tutorial/security/image05.png">

### Get your own user data

Now use the operation `GET` with the path `/users/me`.

You will get your user's data, like:

```JSON
{
  "username": "johndoe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "full_name": "John Doe",
  "disabled": false,
  "hashed_password": "fakehashedsecret"
}
```

<img src="/img/tutorial/security/image06.png">

If you click the lock icon and logout, and then try the same operation again, you will get an HTTP 401 error of:

```JSON
{
  "detail": "Not authenticated"
}
```

### Inactive user

Now try with an inactive user, authenticate with:

User: `alice`

Password: `secret2`

And try to use the operation `GET` with the path `/users/me`.

You will get an "Inactive user" error, like:

```JSON
{
  "detail": "Inactive user"
}
```

## Recap

You now have the tools to implement a complete security system based on `username` and `password` for your API.

Using these tools, you can make the security system compatible with any database and with any user or data model.

The only detail missing is that it is not actually "secure" yet.

In the next chapter you'll see how to use a secure password hashing library and <abbr title="JSON Web Tokens">JWT</abbr> tokens.
````

## File: docs/en/docs/tutorial/background-tasks.md
````markdown
# Background Tasks

You can define background tasks to be run *after* returning a response.

This is useful for operations that need to happen after a request, but that the client doesn't really have to be waiting for the operation to complete before receiving the response.

This includes, for example:

* Email notifications sent after performing an action:
    * As connecting to an email server and sending an email tends to be "slow" (several seconds), you can return the response right away and send the email notification in the background.
* Processing data:
    * For example, let's say you receive a file that must go through a slow process, you can return a response of "Accepted" (HTTP 202) and process the file in the background.

## Using `BackgroundTasks`

First, import `BackgroundTasks` and define a parameter in your *path operation function* with a type declaration of `BackgroundTasks`:

{* ../../docs_src/background_tasks/tutorial001.py hl[1,13] *}

**FastAPI** will create the object of type `BackgroundTasks` for you and pass it as that parameter.

## Create a task function

Create a function to be run as the background task.

It is just a standard function that can receive parameters.

It can be an `async def` or normal `def` function, **FastAPI** will know how to handle it correctly.

In this case, the task function will write to a file (simulating sending an email).

And as the write operation doesn't use `async` and `await`, we define the function with normal `def`:

{* ../../docs_src/background_tasks/tutorial001.py hl[6:9] *}

## Add the background task

Inside of your *path operation function*, pass your task function to the *background tasks* object with the method `.add_task()`:

{* ../../docs_src/background_tasks/tutorial001.py hl[14] *}

`.add_task()` receives as arguments:

* A task function to be run in the background (`write_notification`).
* Any sequence of arguments that should be passed to the task function in order (`email`).
* Any keyword arguments that should be passed to the task function (`message="some notification"`).

## Dependency Injection

Using `BackgroundTasks` also works with the dependency injection system, you can declare a parameter of type `BackgroundTasks` at multiple levels: in a *path operation function*, in a dependency (dependable), in a sub-dependency, etc.

**FastAPI** knows what to do in each case and how to reuse the same object, so that all the background tasks are merged together and are run in the background afterwards:


{* ../../docs_src/background_tasks/tutorial002_an_py310.py hl[13,15,22,25] *}


In this example, the messages will be written to the `log.txt` file *after* the response is sent.

If there was a query in the request, it will be written to the log in a background task.

And then another background task generated at the *path operation function* will write a message using the `email` path parameter.

## Technical Details

The class `BackgroundTasks` comes directly from <a href="https://www.starlette.io/background/" class="external-link" target="_blank">`starlette.background`</a>.

It is imported/included directly into FastAPI so that you can import it from `fastapi` and avoid accidentally importing the alternative `BackgroundTask` (without the `s` at the end) from `starlette.background`.

By only using `BackgroundTasks` (and not `BackgroundTask`), it's then possible to use it as a *path operation function* parameter and have **FastAPI** handle the rest for you, just like when using the `Request` object directly.

It's still possible to use `BackgroundTask` alone in FastAPI, but you have to create the object in your code and return a Starlette `Response` including it.

You can see more details in <a href="https://www.starlette.io/background/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Starlette's official docs for Background Tasks</a>.

## Caveat

If you need to perform heavy background computation and you don't necessarily need it to be run by the same process (for example, you don't need to share memory, variables, etc), you might benefit from using other bigger tools like <a href="https://docs.celeryq.dev" class="external-link" target="_blank">Celery</a>.

They tend to require more complex configurations, a message/job queue manager, like RabbitMQ or Redis, but they allow you to run background tasks in multiple processes, and especially, in multiple servers.

But if you need to access variables and objects from the same **FastAPI** app, or you need to perform small background tasks (like sending an email notification), you can simply just use `BackgroundTasks`.

## Recap

Import and use `BackgroundTasks` with parameters in *path operation functions* and dependencies to add background tasks.

# Bigger Applications - Multiple Files

If you are building an application or a web API, it's rarely the case that you can put everything in a single file.

**FastAPI** provides a convenience tool to structure your application while keeping all the flexibility.

/// info

If you come from Flask, this would be the equivalent of Flask's Blueprints.

///

## An example file structure

Let's say you have a file structure like this:

```
.
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── dependencies.py
│   └── routers
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── items.py
│   │   └── users.py
│   └── internal
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── admin.py
```

/// tip

There are several `__init__.py` files: one in each directory or subdirectory.

This is what allows importing code from one file into another.

For example, in `app/main.py` you could have a line like:

```
from app.routers import items
```

///

* The `app` directory contains everything. And it has an empty file `app/__init__.py`, so it is a "Python package" (a collection of "Python modules"): `app`.
* It contains an `app/main.py` file. As it is inside a Python package (a directory with a file `__init__.py`), it is a "module" of that package: `app.main`.
* There's also an `app/dependencies.py` file, just like `app/main.py`, it is a "module": `app.dependencies`.
* There's a subdirectory `app/routers/` with another file `__init__.py`, so it's a "Python subpackage": `app.routers`.
* The file `app/routers/items.py` is inside a package, `app/routers/`, so, it's a submodule: `app.routers.items`.
* The same with `app/routers/users.py`, it's another submodule: `app.routers.users`.
* There's also a subdirectory `app/internal/` with another file `__init__.py`, so it's another "Python subpackage": `app.internal`.
* And the file `app/internal/admin.py` is another submodule: `app.internal.admin`.

<img src="/img/tutorial/bigger-applications/package.drawio.svg">

The same file structure with comments:

```
.
├── app                  # "app" is a Python package
│   ├── __init__.py      # this file makes "app" a "Python package"
│   ├── main.py          # "main" module, e.g. import app.main
│   ├── dependencies.py  # "dependencies" module, e.g. import app.dependencies
│   └── routers          # "routers" is a "Python subpackage"

│   │   └── users.py     # "users" submodule, e.g. import app.routers.users
│   └── internal         # "internal" is a "Python subpackage"
│       ├── __init__.py  # makes "internal" a "Python subpackage"
│       └── admin.py     # "admin" submodule, e.g. import app.internal.admin
```

## `APIRouter`

Let's say the file dedicated to handling just users is the submodule at `/app/routers/users.py`.

You want to have the *path operations* related to your users separated from the rest of the code, to keep it organized.

But it's still part of the same **FastAPI** application/web API (it's part of the same "Python Package").

You can create the *path operations* for that module using `APIRouter`.

### Import `APIRouter`

You import it and create an "instance" the same way you would with the class `FastAPI`:

```Python hl_lines="1  3" title="app/routers/users.py"
{!../../docs_src/bigger_applications/app/routers/users.py!}
```

### *Path operations* with `APIRouter`

And then you use it to declare your *path operations*.

Use it the same way you would use the `FastAPI` class:

```Python hl_lines="6  11  16" title="app/routers/users.py"
{!../../docs_src/bigger_applications/app/routers/users.py!}
```

You can think of `APIRouter` as a "mini `FastAPI`" class.

All the same options are supported.

All the same `parameters`, `responses`, `dependencies`, `tags`, etc.

/// tip

In this example, the variable is called `router`, but you can name it however you want.

///

We are going to include this `APIRouter` in the main `FastAPI` app, but first, let's check the dependencies and another `APIRouter`.

## Dependencies

We see that we are going to need some dependencies used in several places of the application.

So we put them in their own `dependencies` module (`app/dependencies.py`).

We will now use a simple dependency to read a custom `X-Token` header:

//// tab | Python 3.9+

```Python hl_lines="3  6-8" title="app/dependencies.py"
{!> ../../docs_src/bigger_applications/app_an_py39/dependencies.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python hl_lines="1  5-7" title="app/dependencies.py"
{!> ../../docs_src/bigger_applications/app_an/dependencies.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+ non-Annotated

/// tip

Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

///

```Python hl_lines="1  4-6" title="app/dependencies.py"
{!> ../../docs_src/bigger_applications/app/dependencies.py!}
```

////

/// tip

We are using an invented header to simplify this example.

But in real cases you will get better results using the integrated [Security utilities](security/index.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

///

## Another module with `APIRouter`

Let's say you also have the endpoints dedicated to handling "items" from your application in the module at `app/routers/items.py`.

You have *path operations* for:

* `/items/`
* `/items/{item_id}`

It's all the same structure as with `app/routers/users.py`.

But we want to be smarter and simplify the code a bit.

We know all the *path operations* in this module have the same:

* Path `prefix`: `/items`.
* `tags`: (just one tag: `items`).
* Extra `responses`.
* `dependencies`: they all need that `X-Token` dependency we created.

So, instead of adding all that to each *path operation*, we can add it to the `APIRouter`.

```Python hl_lines="5-10  16  21" title="app/routers/items.py"
{!../../docs_src/bigger_applications/app/routers/items.py!}
```

As the path of each *path operation* has to start with `/`, like in:

```Python hl_lines="1"
@router.get("/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: str):
    ...
```

...the prefix must not include a final `/`.

So, the prefix in this case is `/items`.

We can also add a list of `tags` and extra `responses` that will be applied to all the *path operations* included in this router.

And we can add a list of `dependencies` that will be added to all the *path operations* in the router and will be executed/solved for each request made to them.

/// tip

Note that, much like [dependencies in *path operation decorators*](dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, no value will be passed to your *path operation function*.

///

The end result is that the item paths are now:

* `/items/`
* `/items/{item_id}`

...as we intended.

* They will be marked with a list of tags that contain a single string `"items"`.
    * These "tags" are especially useful for the automatic interactive documentation systems (using OpenAPI).
* All of them will include the predefined `responses`.
* All these *path operations* will have the list of `dependencies` evaluated/executed before them.
    * If you also declare dependencies in a specific *path operation*, **they will be executed too**.
    * The router dependencies are executed first, then the [`dependencies` in the decorator](dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, and then the normal parameter dependencies.
    * You can also add [`Security` dependencies with `scopes`](../advanced/security/oauth2-scopes.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

/// tip

Having `dependencies` in the `APIRouter` can be used, for example, to require authentication for a whole group of *path operations*. Even if the dependencies are not added individually to each one of them.

///

/// check

The `prefix`, `tags`, `responses`, and `dependencies` parameters are (as in many other cases) just a feature from **FastAPI** to help you avoid code duplication.

///

### Import the dependencies

This code lives in the module `app.routers.items`, the file `app/routers/items.py`.

And we need to get the dependency function from the module `app.dependencies`, the file `app/dependencies.py`.

So we use a relative import with `..` for the dependencies:

```Python hl_lines="3" title="app/routers/items.py"
{!../../docs_src/bigger_applications/app/routers/items.py!}
```

#### How relative imports work

/// tip

If you know perfectly how imports work, continue to the next section below.

///

A single dot `.`, like in:

```Python
from .dependencies import get_token_header
```

would mean:

* Starting in the same package that this module (the file `app/routers/items.py`) lives in (the directory `app/routers/`)...
* find the module `dependencies` (an imaginary file at `app/routers/dependencies.py`)...
* and from it, import the function `get_token_header`.

But that file doesn't exist, our dependencies are in a file at `app/dependencies.py`.

Remember how our app/file structure looks like:

<img src="/img/tutorial/bigger-applications/package.drawio.svg">

---

The two dots `..`, like in:

```Python
from ..dependencies import get_token_header
```

mean:

* Starting in the same package that this module (the file `app/routers/items.py`) lives in (the directory `app/routers/`)...
* go to the parent package (the directory `app/`)...
* and in there, find the module `dependencies` (the file at `app/dependencies.py`)...
* and from it, import the function `get_token_header`.

That works correctly! 🎉

---

The same way, if we had used three dots `...`, like in:

```Python
from ...dependencies import get_token_header
```

that would mean:

* Starting in the same package that this module (the file `app/routers/items.py`) lives in (the directory `app/routers/`)...
* go to the parent package (the directory `app/`)...
* then go to the parent of that package (there's no parent package, `app` is the top level 😱)...
* and in there, find the module `dependencies` (the file at `app/dependencies.py`)...
* and from it, import the function `get_token_header`.

That would refer to some package above `app/`, with its own file `__init__.py`, etc. But we don't have that. So, that would throw an error in our example. 🚨

But now you know how it works, so you can use relative imports in your own apps no matter how complex they are. 🤓

### Add some custom `tags`, `responses`, and `dependencies`

We are not adding the prefix `/items` nor the `tags=["items"]` to each *path operation* because we added them to the `APIRouter`.

But we can still add _more_ `tags` that will be applied to a specific *path operation*, and also some extra `responses` specific to that *path operation*:

```Python hl_lines="30-31" title="app/routers/items.py"
{!../../docs_src/bigger_applications/app/routers/items.py!}
```

/// tip

This last path operation will have the combination of tags: `["items", "custom"]`.

And it will also have both responses in the documentation, one for `404` and one for `403`.

///

## The main `FastAPI`

Now, let's see the module at `app/main.py`.

Here's where you import and use the class `FastAPI`.

This will be the main file in your application that ties everything together.

And as most of your logic will now live in its own specific module, the main file will be quite simple.

### Import `FastAPI`

You import and create a `FastAPI` class as normally.

And we can even declare [global dependencies](dependencies/global-dependencies.md){.internal-link target=_blank} that will be combined with the dependencies for each `APIRouter`:

```Python hl_lines="1  3  7" title="app/main.py"
{!../../docs_src/bigger_applications/app/main.py!}
```

### Import the `APIRouter`

Now we import the other submodules that have `APIRouter`s:

```Python hl_lines="4-5" title="app/main.py"
{!../../docs_src/bigger_applications/app/main.py!}
```

As the files `app/routers/users.py` and `app/routers/items.py` are submodules that are part of the same Python package `app`, we can use a single dot `.` to import them using "relative imports".

### How the importing works

The section:

```Python
from .routers import items, users
```

means:

* Starting in the same package that this module (the file `app/main.py`) lives in (the directory `app/`)...
* look for the subpackage `routers` (the directory at `app/routers/`)...
* and from it, import the submodule `items` (the file at `app/routers/items.py`) and `users` (the file at `app/routers/users.py`)...

The module `items` will have a variable `router` (`items.router`). This is the same one we created in the file `app/routers/items.py`, it's an `APIRouter` object.

And then we do the same for the module `users`.

We could also import them like:

```Python
from app.routers import items, users
```

/// info

The first version is a "relative import":

```Python
from .routers import items, users
```

The second version is an "absolute import":

```Python
from app.routers import items, users
```

To learn more about Python Packages and Modules, read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html" class="external-link" target="_blank">the official Python documentation about Modules</a>.

///

### Avoid name collisions

We are importing the submodule `items` directly, instead of importing just its variable `router`.

This is because we also have another variable named `router` in the submodule `users`.

If we had imported one after the other, like:

```Python
from .routers.items import router
from .routers.users import router
```

the `router` from `users` would overwrite the one from `items` and we wouldn't be able to use them at the same time.

So, to be able to use both of them in the same file, we import the submodules directly:

```Python hl_lines="5" title="app/main.py"
{!../../docs_src/bigger_applications/app/main.py!}
```

### Include the `APIRouter`s for `users` and `items`

Now, let's include the `router`s from the submodules `users` and `items`:

```Python hl_lines="10-11" title="app/main.py"
{!../../docs_src/bigger_applications/app/main.py!}
```

/// info

`users.router` contains the `APIRouter` inside of the file `app/routers/users.py`.

And `items.router` contains the `APIRouter` inside of the file `app/routers/items.py`.

///

With `app.include_router()` we can add each `APIRouter` to the main `FastAPI` application.

It will include all the routes from that router as part of it.

/// note | Technical Details

It will actually internally create a *path operation* for each *path operation* that was declared in the `APIRouter`.

So, behind the scenes, it will actually work as if everything was the same single app.

///

/// check

You don't have to worry about performance when including routers.

This will take microseconds and will only happen at startup.

So it won't affect performance. ⚡

///

### Include an `APIRouter` with a custom `prefix`, `tags`, `responses`, and `dependencies`

Now, let's imagine your organization gave you the `app/internal/admin.py` file.

It contains an `APIRouter` with some admin *path operations* that your organization shares between several projects.

For this example it will be super simple. But let's say that because it is shared with other projects in the organization, we cannot modify it and add a `prefix`, `dependencies`, `tags`, etc. directly to the `APIRouter`:

```Python hl_lines="3" title="app/internal/admin.py"
{!../../docs_src/bigger_applications/app/internal/admin.py!}
```

But we still want to set a custom `prefix` when including the `APIRouter` so that all its *path operations* start with `/admin`, we want to secure it with the `dependencies` we already have for this project, and we want to include `tags` and `responses`.

We can declare all that without having to modify the original `APIRouter` by passing those parameters to `app.include_router()`:

```Python hl_lines="14-17" title="app/main.py"
{!../../docs_src/bigger_applications/app/main.py!}
```

That way, the original `APIRouter` will stay unmodified, so we can still share that same `app/internal/admin.py` file with other projects in the organization.

The result is that in our app, each of the *path operations* from the `admin` module will have:

* The prefix `/admin`.
* The tag `admin`.
* The dependency `get_token_header`.
* The response `418`. 🍵

But that will only affect that `APIRouter` in our app, not in any other code that uses it.

So, for example, other projects could use the same `APIRouter` with a different authentication method.

### Include a *path operation*

We can also add *path operations* directly to the `FastAPI` app.

Here we do it... just to show that we can 🤷:

```Python hl_lines="21-23" title="app/main.py"
{!../../docs_src/bigger_applications/app/main.py!}
```

and it will work correctly, together with all the other *path operations* added with `app.include_router()`.

/// info | Very Technical Details

**Note**: this is a very technical detail that you probably can **just skip**.

---

The `APIRouter`s are not "mounted", they are not isolated from the rest of the application.

This is because we want to include their *path operations* in the OpenAPI schema and the user interfaces.

As we cannot just isolate them and "mount" them independently of the rest, the *path operations* are "cloned" (re-created), not included directly.

///

## Check the automatic API docs

Now, run your app:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ fastapi dev app/main.py

<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

</div>

And open the docs at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>.

You will see the automatic API docs, including the paths from all the submodules, using the correct paths (and prefixes) and the correct tags:

<img src="/img/tutorial/bigger-applications/image01.png">

## Include the same router multiple times with different `prefix`

You can also use `.include_router()` multiple times with the *same* router using different prefixes.

This could be useful, for example, to expose the same API under different prefixes, e.g. `/api/v1` and `/api/latest`.

This is an advanced usage that you might not really need, but it's there in case you do.

## Include an `APIRouter` in another

The same way you can include an `APIRouter` in a `FastAPI` application, you can include an `APIRouter` in another `APIRouter` using:

```Python
router.include_router(other_router)
```

Make sure you do it before including `router` in the `FastAPI` app, so that the *path operations* from `other_router` are also included.
````

## File: docs/en/docs/tutorial/body-fields.md
````markdown
# Body - Fields

The same way you can declare additional validation and metadata in *path operation function* parameters with `Query`, `Path` and `Body`, you can declare validation and metadata inside of Pydantic models using Pydantic's `Field`.

## Import `Field`

First, you have to import it:

{* ../../docs_src/body_fields/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[4] *}


/// warning

Notice that `Field` is imported directly from `pydantic`, not from `fastapi` as are all the rest (`Query`, `Path`, `Body`, etc).

///

## Declare model attributes

You can then use `Field` with model attributes:

{* ../../docs_src/body_fields/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[11:14] *}

`Field` works the same way as `Query`, `Path` and `Body`, it has all the same parameters, etc.

/// note | Technical Details

Actually, `Query`, `Path` and others you'll see next create objects of subclasses of a common `Param` class, which is itself a subclass of Pydantic's `FieldInfo` class.

And Pydantic's `Field` returns an instance of `FieldInfo` as well.

`Body` also returns objects of a subclass of `FieldInfo` directly. And there are others you will see later that are subclasses of the `Body` class.

Remember that when you import `Query`, `Path`, and others from `fastapi`, those are actually functions that return special classes.

///

/// tip

Notice how each model's attribute with a type, default value and `Field` has the same structure as a *path operation function's* parameter, with `Field` instead of `Path`, `Query` and `Body`.

///

## Add extra information

You can declare extra information in `Field`, `Query`, `Body`, etc. And it will be included in the generated JSON Schema.

You will learn more about adding extra information later in the docs, when learning to declare examples.

/// warning

Extra keys passed to `Field` will also be present in the resulting OpenAPI schema for your application.
As these keys may not necessarily be part of the OpenAPI specification, some OpenAPI tools, for example [the OpenAPI validator](https://validator.swagger.io/), may not work with your generated schema.

///

## Recap

You can use Pydantic's `Field` to declare extra validations and metadata for model attributes.

You can also use the extra keyword arguments to pass additional JSON Schema metadata.
````

## File: docs/en/docs/tutorial/body-multiple-params.md
````markdown
# Body - Multiple Parameters

Now that we have seen how to use `Path` and `Query`, let's see more advanced uses of request body declarations.

## Mix `Path`, `Query` and body parameters

First, of course, you can mix `Path`, `Query` and request body parameter declarations freely and **FastAPI** will know what to do.

And you can also declare body parameters as optional, by setting the default to `None`:

{* ../../docs_src/body_multiple_params/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[18:20] *}

/// note

Notice that, in this case, the `item` that would be taken from the body is optional. As it has a `None` default value.

///

## Multiple body parameters

In the previous example, the *path operations* would expect a JSON body with the attributes of an `Item`, like:

```JSON
{
    "name": "Foo",
    "description": "The pretender",
    "price": 42.0,
    "tax": 3.2
}
```

But you can also declare multiple body parameters, e.g. `item` and `user`:

{* ../../docs_src/body_multiple_params/tutorial002_py310.py hl[20] *}


In this case, **FastAPI** will notice that there is more than one body parameter in the function (there are two parameters that are Pydantic models).

So, it will then use the parameter names as keys (field names) in the body, and expect a body like:

```JSON
{
    "item": {
        "name": "Foo",
        "description": "The pretender",
        "price": 42.0,
        "tax": 3.2
    },
    "user": {
        "username": "dave",
        "full_name": "Dave Grohl"
    }
}
```

/// note

Notice that even though the `item` was declared the same way as before, it is now expected to be inside of the body with a key `item`.

///

**FastAPI** will do the automatic conversion from the request, so that the parameter `item` receives its specific content and the same for `user`.

It will perform the validation of the compound data, and will document it like that for the OpenAPI schema and automatic docs.

## Singular values in body

The same way there is a `Query` and `Path` to define extra data for query and path parameters, **FastAPI** provides an equivalent `Body`.

For example, extending the previous model, you could decide that you want to have another key `importance` in the same body, besides the `item` and `user`.

If you declare it as is, because it is a singular value, **FastAPI** will assume that it is a query parameter.

But you can instruct **FastAPI** to treat it as another body key using `Body`:

{* ../../docs_src/body_multiple_params/tutorial003_an_py310.py hl[23] *}


In this case, **FastAPI** will expect a body like:

```JSON
{
    "item": {
        "name": "Foo",
        "description": "The pretender",
        "price": 42.0,
        "tax": 3.2
    },
    "user": {
        "username": "dave",
        "full_name": "Dave Grohl"
    },
    "importance": 5
}
```

Again, it will convert the data types, validate, document, etc.

## Multiple body params and query

Of course, you can also declare additional query parameters whenever you need, additional to any body parameters.

As, by default, singular values are interpreted as query parameters, you don't have to explicitly add a `Query`, you can just do:

```Python
q: Union[str, None] = None
```

Or in Python 3.10 and above:

```Python
q: str | None = None
```

For example:

{* ../../docs_src/body_multiple_params/tutorial004_an_py310.py hl[28] *}


/// info

`Body` also has all the same extra validation and metadata parameters as `Query`,`Path` and others you will see later.

///

## Embed a single body parameter

Let's say you only have a single `item` body parameter from a Pydantic model `Item`.

By default, **FastAPI** will then expect its body directly.

But if you want it to expect a JSON with a key `item` and inside of it the model contents, as it does when you declare extra body parameters, you can use the special `Body` parameter `embed`:

```Python
item: Item = Body(embed=True)
```

as in:

{* ../../docs_src/body_multiple_params/tutorial005_an_py310.py hl[17] *}


In this case **FastAPI** will expect a body like:

```JSON hl_lines="2"
{
    "item": {
        "name": "Foo",
        "description": "The pretender",
        "price": 42.0,
        "tax": 3.2
    }
}
```

instead of:

```JSON
{
    "name": "Foo",
    "description": "The pretender",
    "price": 42.0,
    "tax": 3.2
}
```

## Recap

You can add multiple body parameters to your *path operation function*, even though a request can only have a single body.

But **FastAPI** will handle it, give you the correct data in your function, and validate and document the correct schema in the *path operation*.

You can also declare singular values to be received as part of the body.

And you can instruct **FastAPI** to embed the body in a key even when there is only a single parameter declared.
````

## File: docs/en/docs/tutorial/body-nested-models.md
````markdown
# Body - Nested Models

With **FastAPI**, you can define, validate, document, and use arbitrarily deeply nested models (thanks to Pydantic).

## List fields

You can define an attribute to be a subtype. For example, a Python `list`:

{* ../../docs_src/body_nested_models/tutorial001_py310.py hl[12] *}

This will make `tags` be a list, although it doesn't declare the type of the elements of the list.

## List fields with type parameter

But Python has a specific way to declare lists with internal types, or "type parameters":

### Import typing's `List`

In Python 3.9 and above you can use the standard `list` to declare these type annotations as we'll see below. 💡

But in Python versions before 3.9 (3.6 and above), you first need to import `List` from standard Python's `typing` module:

{* ../../docs_src/body_nested_models/tutorial002.py hl[1] *}

### Declare a `list` with a type parameter

To declare types that have type parameters (internal types), like `list`, `dict`, `tuple`:

* If you are in a Python version lower than 3.9, import their equivalent version from the `typing` module
* Pass the internal type(s) as "type parameters" using square brackets: `[` and `]`

In Python 3.9 it would be:

```Python
my_list: list[str]
```

In versions of Python before 3.9, it would be:

```Python
from typing import List

my_list: List[str]
```

That's all standard Python syntax for type declarations.

Use that same standard syntax for model attributes with internal types.

So, in our example, we can make `tags` be specifically a "list of strings":

{* ../../docs_src/body_nested_models/tutorial002_py310.py hl[12] *}

## Set types

But then we think about it, and realize that tags shouldn't repeat, they would probably be unique strings.

And Python has a special data type for sets of unique items, the `set`.

Then we can declare `tags` as a set of strings:

{* ../../docs_src/body_nested_models/tutorial003_py310.py hl[12] *}

With this, even if you receive a request with duplicate data, it will be converted to a set of unique items.

And whenever you output that data, even if the source had duplicates, it will be output as a set of unique items.

And it will be annotated / documented accordingly too.

## Nested Models

Each attribute of a Pydantic model has a type.

But that type can itself be another Pydantic model.

So, you can declare deeply nested JSON "objects" with specific attribute names, types and validations.

All that, arbitrarily nested.

### Define a submodel

For example, we can define an `Image` model:

{* ../../docs_src/body_nested_models/tutorial004_py310.py hl[7:9] *}

### Use the submodel as a type

And then we can use it as the type of an attribute:

{* ../../docs_src/body_nested_models/tutorial004_py310.py hl[18] *}

This would mean that **FastAPI** would expect a body similar to:

```JSON
{
    "name": "Foo",
    "description": "The pretender",
    "price": 42.0,
    "tax": 3.2,
    "tags": ["rock", "metal", "bar"],
    "image": {
        "url": "http://example.com/baz.jpg",
        "name": "The Foo live"
    }
}
```

Again, doing just that declaration, with **FastAPI** you get:

* Editor support (completion, etc.), even for nested models
* Data conversion
* Data validation
* Automatic documentation

## Special types and validation

Apart from normal singular types like `str`, `int`, `float`, etc. you can use more complex singular types that inherit from `str`.

To see all the options you have, checkout <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/types/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic's Type Overview</a>. You will see some examples in the next chapter.

For example, as in the `Image` model we have a `url` field, we can declare it to be an instance of Pydantic's `HttpUrl` instead of a `str`:

{* ../../docs_src/body_nested_models/tutorial005_py310.py hl[2,8] *}

The string will be checked to be a valid URL, and documented in JSON Schema / OpenAPI as such.

## Attributes with lists of submodels

You can also use Pydantic models as subtypes of `list`, `set`, etc.:

{* ../../docs_src/body_nested_models/tutorial006_py310.py hl[18] *}

This will expect (convert, validate, document, etc.) a JSON body like:

```JSON hl_lines="11"
{
    "name": "Foo",
    "description": "The pretender",
    "price": 42.0,
    "tax": 3.2,
    "tags": [
        "rock",
        "metal",
        "bar"
    ],
    "images": [
        {
            "url": "http://example.com/baz.jpg",
            "name": "The Foo live"
        },
        {
            "url": "http://example.com/dave.jpg",
            "name": "The Baz"
        }
    ]
}
```

/// info

Notice how the `images` key now has a list of image objects.

///

## Deeply nested models

You can define arbitrarily deeply nested models:

{* ../../docs_src/body_nested_models/tutorial007_py310.py hl[7,12,18,21,25] *}

/// info

Notice how `Offer` has a list of `Item`s, which in turn have an optional list of `Image`s

///

## Bodies of pure lists

If the top level value of the JSON body you expect is a JSON `array` (a Python `list`), you can declare the type in the parameter of the function, the same as in Pydantic models:

```Python
images: List[Image]
```

or in Python 3.9 and above:

```Python
images: list[Image]
```

as in:

{* ../../docs_src/body_nested_models/tutorial008_py39.py hl[13] *}

## Editor support everywhere

And you get editor support everywhere.

Even for items inside of lists:

<img src="/img/tutorial/body-nested-models/image01.png">

You couldn't get this kind of editor support if you were working directly with `dict` instead of Pydantic models.

But you don't have to worry about them either, incoming dicts are converted automatically and your output is converted automatically to JSON too.

## Bodies of arbitrary `dict`s

You can also declare a body as a `dict` with keys of some type and values of some other type.

This way, you don't have to know beforehand what the valid field/attribute names are (as would be the case with Pydantic models).

This would be useful if you want to receive keys that you don't already know.

---

Another useful case is when you want to have keys of another type (e.g., `int`).

That's what we are going to see here.

In this case, you would accept any `dict` as long as it has `int` keys with `float` values:

{* ../../docs_src/body_nested_models/tutorial009_py39.py hl[7] *}

/// tip

Keep in mind that JSON only supports `str` as keys.

But Pydantic has automatic data conversion.

This means that, even though your API clients can only send strings as keys, as long as those strings contain pure integers, Pydantic will convert them and validate them.

And the `dict` you receive as `weights` will actually have `int` keys and `float` values.

///

## Recap

With **FastAPI** you have the maximum flexibility provided by Pydantic models, while keeping your code simple, short and elegant.

But with all the benefits:

* Editor support (completion everywhere!)
* Data conversion (a.k.a. parsing / serialization)
* Data validation
* Schema documentation
* Automatic docs

# Body - Updates

## Update replacing with `PUT`

To update an item you can use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT" class="external-link" target="_blank">HTTP `PUT`</a> operation.

You can use the `jsonable_encoder` to convert the input data to data that can be stored as JSON (e.g. with a NoSQL database). For example, converting `datetime` to `str`.

{* ../../docs_src/body_updates/tutorial001_py310.py hl[28:33] *}

`PUT` is used to receive data that should replace the existing data.

### Warning about replacing

That means that if you want to update the item `bar` using `PUT` with a body containing:

```Python
{
    "name": "Barz",
    "price": 3,
    "description": None,
}
```

because it doesn't include the already stored attribute `"tax": 20.2`, the input model would take the default value of `"tax": 10.5`.

And the data would be saved with that "new" `tax` of `10.5`.

## Partial updates with `PATCH`

You can also use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PATCH" class="external-link" target="_blank">HTTP `PATCH`</a> operation to *partially* update data.

This means that you can send only the data that you want to update, leaving the rest intact.

/// note

`PATCH` is less commonly used and known than `PUT`.

And many teams use only `PUT`, even for partial updates.

You are **free** to use them however you want, **FastAPI** doesn't impose any restrictions.

But this guide shows you, more or less, how they are intended to be used.

///

### Using Pydantic's `exclude_unset` parameter

If you want to receive partial updates, it's very useful to use the parameter `exclude_unset` in Pydantic's model's `.model_dump()`.

Like `item.model_dump(exclude_unset=True)`.

/// info

In Pydantic v1 the method was called `.dict()`, it was deprecated (but still supported) in Pydantic v2, and renamed to `.model_dump()`.

The examples here use `.dict()` for compatibility with Pydantic v1, but you should use `.model_dump()` instead if you can use Pydantic v2.

///

That would generate a `dict` with only the data that was set when creating the `item` model, excluding default values.

Then you can use this to generate a `dict` with only the data that was set (sent in the request), omitting default values:

{* ../../docs_src/body_updates/tutorial002_py310.py hl[32] *}

### Using Pydantic's `update` parameter

Now, you can create a copy of the existing model using `.model_copy()`, and pass the `update` parameter with a `dict` containing the data to update.

/// info

In Pydantic v1 the method was called `.copy()`, it was deprecated (but still supported) in Pydantic v2, and renamed to `.model_copy()`.

The examples here use `.copy()` for compatibility with Pydantic v1, but you should use `.model_copy()` instead if you can use Pydantic v2.

///

Like `stored_item_model.model_copy(update=update_data)`:

{* ../../docs_src/body_updates/tutorial002_py310.py hl[33] *}

### Partial updates recap

In summary, to apply partial updates you would:

* (Optionally) use `PATCH` instead of `PUT`.
* Retrieve the stored data.
* Put that data in a Pydantic model.
* Generate a `dict` without default values from the input model (using `exclude_unset`).
    * This way you can update only the values actually set by the user, instead of overriding values already stored with default values in your model.
* Create a copy of the stored model, updating its attributes with the received partial updates (using the `update` parameter).
* Convert the copied model to something that can be stored in your DB (for example, using the `jsonable_encoder`).
    * This is comparable to using the model's `.model_dump()` method again, but it makes sure (and converts) the values to data types that can be converted to JSON, for example, `datetime` to `str`.
* Save the data to your DB.
* Return the updated model.

{* ../../docs_src/body_updates/tutorial002_py310.py hl[28:35] *}

/// tip

You can actually use this same technique with an HTTP `PUT` operation.

But the example here uses `PATCH` because it was created for these use cases.

///

/// note

Notice that the input model is still validated.

So, if you want to receive partial updates that can omit all the attributes, you need to have a model with all the attributes marked as optional (with default values or `None`).

To distinguish from the models with all optional values for **updates** and models with required values for **creation**, you can use the ideas described in [Extra Models](extra-models.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

````

## File: docs/en/docs/tutorial/body.md
````markdown
# Request Body

When you need to send data from a client (let's say, a browser) to your API, you send it as a **request body**.

A **request** body is data sent by the client to your API. A **response** body is the data your API sends to the client.

Your API almost always has to send a **response** body. But clients don't necessarily need to send **request bodies** all the time, sometimes they only request a path, maybe with some query parameters, but don't send a body.

To declare a **request** body, you use <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic</a> models with all their power and benefits.

/// info

To send data, you should use one of: `POST` (the more common), `PUT`, `DELETE` or `PATCH`.

Sending a body with a `GET` request has an undefined behavior in the specifications, nevertheless, it is supported by FastAPI, only for very complex/extreme use cases.

As it is discouraged, the interactive docs with Swagger UI won't show the documentation for the body when using `GET`, and proxies in the middle might not support it.

///

## Import Pydantic's `BaseModel`

First, you need to import `BaseModel` from `pydantic`:

{* ../../docs_src/body/tutorial001_py310.py hl[2] *}

## Create your data model

Then you declare your data model as a class that inherits from `BaseModel`.

Use standard Python types for all the attributes:

{* ../../docs_src/body/tutorial001_py310.py hl[5:9] *}


The same as when declaring query parameters, when a model attribute has a default value, it is not required. Otherwise, it is required. Use `None` to make it just optional.

For example, this model above declares a JSON "`object`" (or Python `dict`) like:

```JSON
{
    "name": "Foo",
    "description": "An optional description",
    "price": 45.2,
    "tax": 3.5
}
```

...as `description` and `tax` are optional (with a default value of `None`), this JSON "`object`" would also be valid:

```JSON
{
    "name": "Foo",
    "price": 45.2
}
```

## Declare it as a parameter

To add it to your *path operation*, declare it the same way you declared path and query parameters:

{* ../../docs_src/body/tutorial001_py310.py hl[16] *}

...and declare its type as the model you created, `Item`.

## Results

With just that Python type declaration, **FastAPI** will:

* Read the body of the request as JSON.
* Convert the corresponding types (if needed).
* Validate the data.
    * If the data is invalid, it will return a nice and clear error, indicating exactly where and what was the incorrect data.
* Give you the received data in the parameter `item`.
    * As you declared it in the function to be of type `Item`, you will also have all the editor support (completion, etc) for all of the attributes and their types.
* Generate <a href="https://json-schema.org" class="external-link" target="_blank">JSON Schema</a> definitions for your model, you can also use them anywhere else you like if it makes sense for your project.
* Those schemas will be part of the generated OpenAPI schema, and used by the automatic documentation <abbr title="User Interfaces">UIs</abbr>.

## Automatic docs

The JSON Schemas of your models will be part of your OpenAPI generated schema, and will be shown in the interactive API docs:

<img src="/img/tutorial/body/image01.png">

And will also be used in the API docs inside each *path operation* that needs them:

<img src="/img/tutorial/body/image02.png">

## Editor support

In your editor, inside your function you will get type hints and completion everywhere (this wouldn't happen if you received a `dict` instead of a Pydantic model):

<img src="/img/tutorial/body/image03.png">

You also get error checks for incorrect type operations:

<img src="/img/tutorial/body/image04.png">

This is not by chance, the whole framework was built around that design.

And it was thoroughly tested at the design phase, before any implementation, to ensure it would work with all the editors.

There were even some changes to Pydantic itself to support this.

The previous screenshots were taken with <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" class="external-link" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>.

But you would get the same editor support with <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" class="external-link" target="_blank">PyCharm</a> and most of the other Python editors:

<img src="/img/tutorial/body/image05.png">

/// tip

If you use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" class="external-link" target="_blank">PyCharm</a> as your editor, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/koxudaxi/pydantic-pycharm-plugin/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic PyCharm Plugin</a>.

It improves editor support for Pydantic models, with:

* auto-completion
* type checks
* refactoring
* searching
* inspections

///

## Use the model

Inside of the function, you can access all the attributes of the model object directly:

{* ../../docs_src/body/tutorial002_py310.py *}

## Request body + path parameters

You can declare path parameters and request body at the same time.

**FastAPI** will recognize that the function parameters that match path parameters should be **taken from the path**, and that function parameters that are declared to be Pydantic models should be **taken from the request body**.

{* ../../docs_src/body/tutorial003_py310.py hl[15:16] *}


## Request body + path + query parameters

You can also declare **body**, **path** and **query** parameters, all at the same time.

**FastAPI** will recognize each of them and take the data from the correct place.

{* ../../docs_src/body/tutorial004_py310.py hl[16] *}

The function parameters will be recognized as follows:

* If the parameter is also declared in the **path**, it will be used as a path parameter.
* If the parameter is of a **singular type** (like `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, etc) it will be interpreted as a **query** parameter.
* If the parameter is declared to be of the type of a **Pydantic model**, it will be interpreted as a request **body**.

/// note

FastAPI will know that the value of `q` is not required because of the default value `= None`.

The `str | None` (Python 3.10+) or `Union` in `Union[str, None]` (Python 3.8+) is not used by FastAPI to determine that the value is not required, it will know it's not required because it has a default value of `= None`.

But adding the type annotations will allow your editor to give you better support and detect errors.

///

## Without Pydantic

If you don't want to use Pydantic models, you can also use **Body** parameters. See the docs for [Body - Multiple Parameters: Singular values in body](body-multiple-params.md#singular-values-in-body){.internal-link target=_blank}.

# Cookie Parameter Models

If you have a group of **cookies** that are related, you can create a **Pydantic model** to declare them. 🍪

This would allow you to **re-use the model** in **multiple places** and also to declare validations and metadata for all the parameters at once. 😎

/// note

This is supported since FastAPI version `0.115.0`. 🤓

///

/// tip

This same technique applies to `Query`, `Cookie`, and `Header`. 😎

///

## Cookies with a Pydantic Model

Declare the **cookie** parameters that you need in a **Pydantic model**, and then declare the parameter as `Cookie`:

{* ../../docs_src/cookie_param_models/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[9:12,16] *}

**FastAPI** will **extract** the data for **each field** from the **cookies** received in the request and give you the Pydantic model you defined.

## Check the Docs

You can see the defined cookies in the docs UI at `/docs`:

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="/img/tutorial/cookie-param-models/image01.png">
</div>

/// info

Have in mind that, as **browsers handle cookies** in special ways and behind the scenes, they **don't** easily allow **JavaScript** to touch them.

If you go to the **API docs UI** at `/docs` you will be able to see the **documentation** for cookies for your *path operations*.

But even if you **fill the data** and click "Execute", because the docs UI works with **JavaScript**, the cookies won't be sent, and you will see an **error** message as if you didn't write any values.

///

## Forbid Extra Cookies

In some special use cases (probably not very common), you might want to **restrict** the cookies that you want to receive.

Your API now has the power to control its own <abbr title="This is a joke, just in case. It has nothing to do with cookie consents, but it's funny that even the API can now reject the poor cookies. Have a cookie. 🍪">cookie consent</abbr>. 🤪🍪

You can use Pydantic's model configuration to `forbid` any `extra` fields:

{* ../../docs_src/cookie_param_models/tutorial002_an_py39.py hl[10] *}

If a client tries to send some **extra cookies**, they will receive an **error** response.

Poor cookie banners with all their effort to get your consent for the <abbr title="This is another joke. Don't pay attention to me. Have some coffee for your cookie. ☕">API to reject it</abbr>. 🍪

For example, if the client tries to send a `santa_tracker` cookie with a value of `good-list-please`, the client will receive an **error** response telling them that the `santa_tracker` <abbr title="Santa disapproves the lack of cookies. 🎅 Okay, no more cookie jokes.">cookie is not allowed</abbr>:

```json
{
    "detail": [
        {
            "type": "extra_forbidden",
            "loc": ["cookie", "santa_tracker"],
            "msg": "Extra inputs are not permitted",
            "input": "good-list-please",
        }
    ]
}
```

## Summary

You can use **Pydantic models** to declare <abbr title="Have a last cookie before you go. 🍪">**cookies**</abbr> in **FastAPI**. 😎

# Cookie Parameters

You can define Cookie parameters the same way you define `Query` and `Path` parameters.

## Import `Cookie`

First import `Cookie`:

{* ../../docs_src/cookie_params/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[3] *}

## Declare `Cookie` parameters

Then declare the cookie parameters using the same structure as with `Path` and `Query`.

You can define the default value as well as all the extra validation or annotation parameters:

{* ../../docs_src/cookie_params/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[9] *}

/// note | Technical Details

`Cookie` is a "sister" class of `Path` and `Query`. It also inherits from the same common `Param` class.

But remember that when you import `Query`, `Path`, `Cookie` and others from `fastapi`, those are actually functions that return special classes.

///

/// info

To declare cookies, you need to use `Cookie`, because otherwise the parameters would be interpreted as query parameters.

Declare cookies with `Cookie`, using the same common pattern as `Query` and `Path`.

# CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS" class="external-link" target="_blank">CORS or "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing"</a> refers to the situations when a frontend running in a browser has JavaScript code that communicates with a backend, and the backend is in a different "origin" than the frontend.

## Origin

An origin is the combination of protocol (`http`, `https`), domain (`myapp.com`, `localhost`, `localhost.tiangolo.com`), and port (`80`, `443`, `8080`).

So, all these are different origins:

* `http://localhost`
* `https://localhost`
* `http://localhost:8080`

Even if they are all in `localhost`, they use different protocols or ports, so, they are different "origins".

## Steps

So, let's say you have a frontend running in your browser at `http://localhost:8080`, and its JavaScript is trying to communicate with a backend running at `http://localhost` (because we don't specify a port, the browser will assume the default port `80`).

Then, the browser will send an HTTP `OPTIONS` request to the `:80`-backend, and if the backend sends the appropriate headers authorizing the communication from this different origin (`http://localhost:8080`) then the `:8080`-browser will let the JavaScript in the frontend send its request to the `:80`-backend.

To achieve this, the `:80`-backend must have a list of "allowed origins".

In this case, the list would have to include `http://localhost:8080` for the `:8080`-frontend to work correctly.

## Wildcards

It's also possible to declare the list as `"*"` (a "wildcard") to say that all are allowed.

But that will only allow certain types of communication, excluding everything that involves credentials: Cookies, Authorization headers like those used with Bearer Tokens, etc.

So, for everything to work correctly, it's better to specify explicitly the allowed origins.

## Use `CORSMiddleware`

You can configure it in your **FastAPI** application using the `CORSMiddleware`.

* Import `CORSMiddleware`.
* Create a list of allowed origins (as strings).
* Add it as a "middleware" to your **FastAPI** application.

You can also specify whether your backend allows:

* Credentials (Authorization headers, Cookies, etc).
* Specific HTTP methods (`POST`, `PUT`) or all of them with the wildcard `"*"`.
* Specific HTTP headers or all of them with the wildcard `"*"`.

{* ../../docs_src/cors/tutorial001.py hl[2,6:11,13:19] *}


The default parameters used by the `CORSMiddleware` implementation are restrictive by default, so you'll need to explicitly enable particular origins, methods, or headers, in order for browsers to be permitted to use them in a Cross-Domain context.

The following arguments are supported:

* `allow_origins` - A list of origins that should be permitted to make cross-origin requests. E.g. `['https://example.org', 'https://www.example.org']`. You can use `['*']` to allow any origin.
* `allow_origin_regex` - A regex string to match against origins that should be permitted to make cross-origin requests. e.g. `'https://.*\.example\.org'`.
* `allow_methods` - A list of HTTP methods that should be allowed for cross-origin requests. Defaults to `['GET']`. You can use `['*']` to allow all standard methods.
* `allow_headers` - A list of HTTP request headers that should be supported for cross-origin requests. Defaults to `[]`. You can use `['*']` to allow all headers. The `Accept`, `Accept-Language`, `Content-Language` and `Content-Type` headers are always allowed for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests" class="external-link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">simple CORS requests</a>.
* `allow_credentials` - Indicate that cookies should be supported for cross-origin requests. Defaults to `False`.

    None of `allow_origins`, `allow_methods` and `allow_headers` can be set to `['*']` if `allow_credentials` is set to `True`. All of them must be <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#credentialed_requests_and_wildcards" class="external-link" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explicitly specified</a>.

* `expose_headers` - Indicate any response headers that should be made accessible to the browser. Defaults to `[]`.
* `max_age` - Sets a maximum time in seconds for browsers to cache CORS responses. Defaults to `600`.

The middleware responds to two particular types of HTTP request...

### CORS preflight requests

These are any `OPTIONS` request with `Origin` and `Access-Control-Request-Method` headers.

In this case the middleware will intercept the incoming request and respond with appropriate CORS headers, and either a `200` or `400` response for informational purposes.

### Simple requests

Any request with an `Origin` header. In this case the middleware will pass the request through as normal, but will include appropriate CORS headers on the response.

## More info

For more info about <abbr title="Cross-Origin Resource Sharing">CORS</abbr>, check the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS" class="external-link" target="_blank">Mozilla CORS documentation</a>.

/// note | Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware`.

**FastAPI** provides several middlewares in `fastapi.middleware` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available middlewares come directly from Starlette.

## File: docs/en/docs/tutorial/debugging.md
````markdown
# Debugging

You can connect the debugger in your editor, for example with Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.

## Call `uvicorn`

In your FastAPI application, import and run `uvicorn` directly:

{* ../../docs_src/debugging/tutorial001.py hl[1,15] *}

### About `__name__ == "__main__"`

The main purpose of the `__name__ == "__main__"` is to have some code that is executed when your file is called with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ python myapp.py
```

</div>

but is not called when another file imports it, like in:

```Python
from myapp import app
```

#### More details

Let's say your file is named `myapp.py`.

If you run it with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ python myapp.py
```

</div>

then the internal variable `__name__` in your file, created automatically by Python, will have as value the string `"__main__"`.

So, the section:

```Python
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

will run.

---

This won't happen if you import that module (file).

So, if you have another file `importer.py` with:

```Python
from myapp import app

# Some more code
```

in that case, the automatically created variable inside of `myapp.py` will not have the variable `__name__` with a value of `"__main__"`.

So, the line:

```Python
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

will not be executed.

/// info

For more information, check <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html" class="external-link" target="_blank">the official Python docs</a>.

///

## Run your code with your debugger

Because you are running the Uvicorn server directly from your code, you can call your Python program (your FastAPI application) directly from the debugger.

---

For example, in Visual Studio Code, you can:

* Go to the "Debug" panel.
* "Add configuration...".
* Select "Python"
* Run the debugger with the option "`Python: Current File (Integrated Terminal)`".

It will then start the server with your **FastAPI** code, stop at your breakpoints, etc.

Here's how it might look:

<img src="/img/tutorial/debugging/image01.png">

---

If you use Pycharm, you can:

* Open the "Run" menu.
* Select the option "Debug...".
* Then a context menu shows up.
* Select the file to debug (in this case, `main.py`).

It will then start the server with your **FastAPI** code, stop at your breakpoints, etc.

Here's how it might look:

````markdown
# JSON Compatible Encoder

There are some cases where you might need to convert a data type (like a Pydantic model) to something compatible with JSON (like a `dict`, `list`, etc).

For example, if you need to store it in a database.

For that, **FastAPI** provides a `jsonable_encoder()` function.

## Using the `jsonable_encoder`

Let's imagine that you have a database `fake_db` that only receives JSON compatible data.

For example, it doesn't receive `datetime` objects, as those are not compatible with JSON.

So, a `datetime` object would have to be converted to a `str` containing the data in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" class="external-link" target="_blank">ISO format</a>.

The same way, this database wouldn't receive a Pydantic model (an object with attributes), only a `dict`.

You can use `jsonable_encoder` for that.

It receives an object, like a Pydantic model, and returns a JSON compatible version:

{* ../../docs_src/encoder/tutorial001_py310.py hl[4,21] *}

In this example, it would convert the Pydantic model to a `dict`, and the `datetime` to a `str`.

The result of calling it is something that can be encoded with the Python standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dumps" class="external-link" target="_blank">`json.dumps()`</a>.

It doesn't return a large `str` containing the data in JSON format (as a string). It returns a Python standard data structure (e.g. a `dict`) with values and sub-values that are all compatible with JSON.

/// note

`jsonable_encoder` is actually used by **FastAPI** internally to convert data. But it is useful in many other scenarios.

# Extra Data Types

Up to now, you have been using common data types, like:

* `int`
* `float`
* `str`
* `bool`

But you can also use more complex data types.

And you will still have the same features as seen up to now:

* Great editor support.
* Data conversion from incoming requests.
* Data conversion for response data.
* Data validation.
* Automatic annotation and documentation.

## Other data types

Here are some of the additional data types you can use:

* `UUID`:
    * A standard "Universally Unique Identifier", common as an ID in many databases and systems.
    * In requests and responses will be represented as a `str`.
* `datetime.datetime`:
    * A Python `datetime.datetime`.
    * In requests and responses will be represented as a `str` in ISO 8601 format, like: `2008-09-15T15:53:00+05:00`.
* `datetime.date`:
    * Python `datetime.date`.
    * In requests and responses will be represented as a `str` in ISO 8601 format, like: `2008-09-15`.
* `datetime.time`:
    * A Python `datetime.time`.
    * In requests and responses will be represented as a `str` in ISO 8601 format, like: `14:23:55.003`.
* `datetime.timedelta`:
    * A Python `datetime.timedelta`.
    * In requests and responses will be represented as a `float` of total seconds.
    * Pydantic also allows representing it as a "ISO 8601 time diff encoding", <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/serialization/#custom-serializers" class="external-link" target="_blank">see the docs for more info</a>.
* `frozenset`:
    * In requests and responses, treated the same as a `set`:
        * In requests, a list will be read, eliminating duplicates and converting it to a `set`.
        * In responses, the `set` will be converted to a `list`.
        * The generated schema will specify that the `set` values are unique (using JSON Schema's `uniqueItems`).
* `bytes`:
    * Standard Python `bytes`.
    * In requests and responses will be treated as `str`.
    * The generated schema will specify that it's a `str` with `binary` "format".
* `Decimal`:
    * Standard Python `Decimal`.
    * In requests and responses, handled the same as a `float`.
* You can check all the valid Pydantic data types here: <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/types/types/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic data types</a>.

## Example

Here's an example *path operation* with parameters using some of the above types.

{* ../../docs_src/extra_data_types/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[1,3,12:16] *}

Note that the parameters inside the function have their natural data type, and you can, for example, perform normal date manipulations, like:

# Extra Models

Continuing with the previous example, it will be common to have more than one related model.

This is especially the case for user models, because:

* The **input model** needs to be able to have a password.
* The **output model** should not have a password.
* The **database model** would probably need to have a hashed password.

/// danger

Never store user's plaintext passwords. Always store a "secure hash" that you can then verify.

If you don't know, you will learn what a "password hash" is in the [security chapters](security/simple-oauth2.md#password-hashing){.internal-link target=_blank}.

///

## Multiple models

Here's a general idea of how the models could look like with their password fields and the places where they are used:

{* ../../docs_src/extra_models/tutorial001_py310.py hl[7,9,14,20,22,27:28,31:33,38:39] *}


/// info

In Pydantic v1 the method was called `.dict()`, it was deprecated (but still supported) in Pydantic v2, and renamed to `.model_dump()`.

The examples here use `.dict()` for compatibility with Pydantic v1, but you should use `.model_dump()` instead if you can use Pydantic v2.

///

### About `**user_in.dict()`

#### Pydantic's `.dict()`

`user_in` is a Pydantic model of class `UserIn`.

Pydantic models have a `.dict()` method that returns a `dict` with the model's data.

So, if we create a Pydantic object `user_in` like:

```Python
user_in = UserIn(username="john", password="secret", email="john.doe@example.com")
```

and then we call:

```Python
user_dict = user_in.dict()
```

we now have a `dict` with the data in the variable `user_dict` (it's a `dict` instead of a Pydantic model object).

And if we call:

```Python
print(user_dict)
```

we would get a Python `dict` with:

```Python
{
    'username': 'john',
    'password': 'secret',
    'email': 'john.doe@example.com',
    'full_name': None,
}
```

#### Unpacking a `dict`

If we take a `dict` like `user_dict` and pass it to a function (or class) with `**user_dict`, Python will "unpack" it. It will pass the keys and values of the `user_dict` directly as key-value arguments.

So, continuing with the `user_dict` from above, writing:

```Python
UserInDB(**user_dict)
```

would result in something equivalent to:

```Python
UserInDB(
    username="john",
    password="secret",
    email="john.doe@example.com",
    full_name=None,
)
```

Or more exactly, using `user_dict` directly, with whatever contents it might have in the future:

```Python
UserInDB(
    username = user_dict["username"],
    password = user_dict["password"],
    email = user_dict["email"],
    full_name = user_dict["full_name"],
)
```

#### A Pydantic model from the contents of another

As in the example above we got `user_dict` from `user_in.dict()`, this code:

```Python
user_dict = user_in.dict()
UserInDB(**user_dict)
```

would be equivalent to:

```Python
UserInDB(**user_in.dict())
```

...because `user_in.dict()` is a `dict`, and then we make Python "unpack" it by passing it to `UserInDB` prefixed with `**`.

So, we get a Pydantic model from the data in another Pydantic model.

#### Unpacking a `dict` and extra keywords

And then adding the extra keyword argument `hashed_password=hashed_password`, like in:

```Python
UserInDB(**user_in.dict(), hashed_password=hashed_password)
```

...ends up being like:

```Python
UserInDB(
    username = user_dict["username"],
    password = user_dict["password"],
    email = user_dict["email"],
    full_name = user_dict["full_name"],
    hashed_password = hashed_password,
)
```

/// warning

The supporting additional functions `fake_password_hasher` and `fake_save_user` are just to demo a possible flow of the data, but they of course are not providing any real security.

///

## Reduce duplication

Reducing code duplication is one of the core ideas in **FastAPI**.

As code duplication increments the chances of bugs, security issues, code desynchronization issues (when you update in one place but not in the others), etc.

And these models are all sharing a lot of the data and duplicating attribute names and types.

We could do better.

We can declare a `UserBase` model that serves as a base for our other models. And then we can make subclasses of that model that inherit its attributes (type declarations, validation, etc).

All the data conversion, validation, documentation, etc. will still work as normally.

That way, we can declare just the differences between the models (with plaintext `password`, with `hashed_password` and without password):

{* ../../docs_src/extra_models/tutorial002_py310.py hl[7,13:14,17:18,21:22] *}

## `Union` or `anyOf`

You can declare a response to be the `Union` of two or more types, that means, that the response would be any of them.

It will be defined in OpenAPI with `anyOf`.

To do that, use the standard Python type hint <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Union" class="external-link" target="_blank">`typing.Union`</a>:

/// note

When defining a <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/types/#unions" class="external-link" target="_blank">`Union`</a>, include the most specific type first, followed by the less specific type. In the example below, the more specific `PlaneItem` comes before `CarItem` in `Union[PlaneItem, CarItem]`.

///

{* ../../docs_src/extra_models/tutorial003_py310.py hl[1,14:15,18:20,33] *}


### `Union` in Python 3.10

In this example we pass `Union[PlaneItem, CarItem]` as the value of the argument `response_model`.

Because we are passing it as a **value to an argument** instead of putting it in a **type annotation**, we have to use `Union` even in Python 3.10.

If it was in a type annotation we could have used the vertical bar, as:

```Python
some_variable: PlaneItem | CarItem
```

But if we put that in the assignment `response_model=PlaneItem | CarItem` we would get an error, because Python would try to perform an **invalid operation** between `PlaneItem` and `CarItem` instead of interpreting that as a type annotation.

## List of models

The same way, you can declare responses of lists of objects.

For that, use the standard Python `typing.List` (or just `list` in Python 3.9 and above):

{* ../../docs_src/extra_models/tutorial004_py39.py hl[18] *}


## Response with arbitrary `dict`

You can also declare a response using a plain arbitrary `dict`, declaring just the type of the keys and values, without using a Pydantic model.

This is useful if you don't know the valid field/attribute names (that would be needed for a Pydantic model) beforehand.

In this case, you can use `typing.Dict` (or just `dict` in Python 3.9 and above):

{* ../../docs_src/extra_models/tutorial005_py39.py hl[6] *}


## Recap

Use multiple Pydantic models and inherit freely for each case.

You don't need to have a single data model per entity if that entity must be able to have different "states". As the case with the user "entity" with a state including `password`, `password_hash` and no password.

### OpenAPI

**FastAPI** generates a "schema" with all your API using the **OpenAPI** standard for defining APIs.

#### "Schema"

A "schema" is a definition or description of something. Not the code that implements it, but just an abstract description.

#### API "schema"

In this case, <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification" class="external-link" target="_blank">OpenAPI</a> is a specification that dictates how to define a schema of your API.

This schema definition includes your API paths, the possible parameters they take, etc.

#### Data "schema"

The term "schema" might also refer to the shape of some data, like a JSON content.

In that case, it would mean the JSON attributes, and data types they have, etc.

#### OpenAPI and JSON Schema

OpenAPI defines an API schema for your API. And that schema includes definitions (or "schemas") of the data sent and received by your API using **JSON Schema**, the standard for JSON data schemas.

#### Check the `openapi.json`

If you are curious about how the raw OpenAPI schema looks like, FastAPI automatically generates a JSON (schema) with the descriptions of all your API.

You can see it directly at: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json</a>.

It will show a JSON starting with something like:

```JSON
{
    "openapi": "3.1.0",
    "info": {
        "title": "FastAPI",
        "version": "0.1.0"
    },
    "paths": {
        "/items/": {
            "get": {
                "responses": {
                    "200": {
                        "description": "Successful Response",
                        "content": {
                            "application/json": {



...
```

#### What is OpenAPI for

The OpenAPI schema is what powers the two interactive documentation systems included.

And there are dozens of alternatives, all based on OpenAPI. You could easily add any of those alternatives to your application built with **FastAPI**.

You could also use it to generate code automatically, for clients that communicate with your API. For example, frontend, mobile or IoT applications.

## Recap, step by step

### Step 1: import `FastAPI`

{* ../../docs_src/first_steps/tutorial001.py hl[1] *}

`FastAPI` is a Python class that provides all the functionality for your API.

/// note | Technical Details

`FastAPI` is a class that inherits directly from `Starlette`.

You can use all the <a href="https://www.starlette.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Starlette</a> functionality with `FastAPI` too.

///

### Step 2: create a `FastAPI` "instance"

{* ../../docs_src/first_steps/tutorial001.py hl[3] *}

Here the `app` variable will be an "instance" of the class `FastAPI`.

This will be the main point of interaction to create all your API.

### Step 3: create a *path operation*

#### Path

"Path" here refers to the last part of the URL starting from the first `/`.

So, in a URL like:

```
https://example.com/items/foo
```

...the path would be:

```
/items/foo
```

/// info

A "path" is also commonly called an "endpoint" or a "route".

///

While building an API, the "path" is the main way to separate "concerns" and "resources".

#### Operation

"Operation" here refers to one of the HTTP "methods".

One of:

* `POST`
* `GET`
* `PUT`
* `DELETE`

...and the more exotic ones:

* `OPTIONS`
* `HEAD`
* `PATCH`
* `TRACE`

In the HTTP protocol, you can communicate to each path using one (or more) of these "methods".

---

When building APIs, you normally use these specific HTTP methods to perform a specific action.

Normally you use:

* `POST`: to create data.
* `GET`: to read data.
* `PUT`: to update data.
* `DELETE`: to delete data.

So, in OpenAPI, each of the HTTP methods is called an "operation".

We are going to call them "**operations**" too.

#### Define a *path operation decorator*

{* ../../docs_src/first_steps/tutorial001.py hl[6] *}

The `@app.get("/")` tells **FastAPI** that the function right below is in charge of handling requests that go to:

* the path `/`
* using a <abbr title="an HTTP GET method"><code>get</code> operation</abbr>

/// info | `@decorator` Info

That `@something` syntax in Python is called a "decorator".

You put it on top of a function. Like a pretty decorative hat (I guess that's where the term came from).

A "decorator" takes the function below and does something with it.

In our case, this decorator tells **FastAPI** that the function below corresponds to the **path** `/` with an **operation** `get`.

It is the "**path operation decorator**".

///

You can also use the other operations:

* `@app.post()`
* `@app.put()`
* `@app.delete()`

And the more exotic ones:

* `@app.options()`
* `@app.head()`
* `@app.patch()`
* `@app.trace()`

/// tip

You are free to use each operation (HTTP method) as you wish.

**FastAPI** doesn't enforce any specific meaning.

The information here is presented as a guideline, not a requirement.

For example, when using GraphQL you normally perform all the actions using only `POST` operations.

///

### Step 4: define the **path operation function**

This is our "**path operation function**":

* **path**: is `/`.
* **operation**: is `get`.
* **function**: is the function below the "decorator" (below `@app.get("/")`).

{* ../../docs_src/first_steps/tutorial001.py hl[7] *}

This is a Python function.

It will be called by **FastAPI** whenever it receives a request to the URL "`/`" using a `GET` operation.

In this case, it is an `async` function.

---

You could also define it as a normal function instead of `async def`:

{* ../../docs_src/first_steps/tutorial003.py hl[7] *}

/// note

If you don't know the difference, check the [Async: *"In a hurry?"*](../async.md#in-a-hurry){.internal-link target=_blank}.

///

### Step 5: return the content

{* ../../docs_src/first_steps/tutorial001.py hl[8] *}

You can return a `dict`, `list`, singular values as `str`, `int`, etc.

You can also return Pydantic models (you'll see more about that later).

There are many other objects and models that will be automatically converted to JSON (including ORMs, etc). Try using your favorite ones, it's highly probable that they are already supported.

## Recap

* Import `FastAPI`.
* Create an `app` instance.
* Write a **path operation decorator** using decorators like `@app.get("/")`.
* Define a **path operation function**; for example, `def root(): ...`.
* Run the development server using the command `fastapi dev`.

## File: docs/en/docs/tutorial/handling-errors.md
````markdown
# Handling Errors

There are many situations in which you need to notify an error to a client that is using your API.

This client could be a browser with a frontend, a code from someone else, an IoT device, etc.

You could need to tell the client that:

* The client doesn't have enough privileges for that operation.
* The client doesn't have access to that resource.
* The item the client was trying to access doesn't exist.
* etc.

In these cases, you would normally return an **HTTP status code** in the range of **400** (from 400 to 499).

This is similar to the 200 HTTP status codes (from 200 to 299). Those "200" status codes mean that somehow there was a "success" in the request.

The status codes in the 400 range mean that there was an error from the client.

Remember all those **"404 Not Found"** errors (and jokes)?

## Use `HTTPException`

To return HTTP responses with errors to the client you use `HTTPException`.

### Import `HTTPException`

{* ../../docs_src/handling_errors/tutorial001.py hl[1] *}

### Raise an `HTTPException` in your code

`HTTPException` is a normal Python exception with additional data relevant for APIs.

Because it's a Python exception, you don't `return` it, you `raise` it.

This also means that if you are inside a utility function that you are calling inside of your *path operation function*, and you raise the `HTTPException` from inside of that utility function, it won't run the rest of the code in the *path operation function*, it will terminate that request right away and send the HTTP error from the `HTTPException` to the client.

The benefit of raising an exception over returning a value will be more evident in the section about Dependencies and Security.

In this example, when the client requests an item by an ID that doesn't exist, raise an exception with a status code of `404`:

{* ../../docs_src/handling_errors/tutorial001.py hl[11] *}

### The resulting response

If the client requests `http://example.com/items/foo` (an `item_id` `"foo"`), that client will receive an HTTP status code of 200, and a JSON response of:

```JSON
{
  "item": "The Foo Wrestlers"
}
```

But if the client requests `http://example.com/items/bar` (a non-existent `item_id` `"bar"`), that client will receive an HTTP status code of 404 (the "not found" error), and a JSON response of:

```JSON
{
  "detail": "Item not found"
}
```

/// tip

When raising an `HTTPException`, you can pass any value that can be converted to JSON as the parameter `detail`, not only `str`.

You could pass a `dict`, a `list`, etc.

They are handled automatically by **FastAPI** and converted to JSON.

///

## Add custom headers

There are some situations in where it's useful to be able to add custom headers to the HTTP error. For example, for some types of security.

You probably won't need to use it directly in your code.

But in case you needed it for an advanced scenario, you can add custom headers:

{* ../../docs_src/handling_errors/tutorial002.py hl[14] *}

## Install custom exception handlers

You can add custom exception handlers with <a href="https://www.starlette.io/exceptions/" class="external-link" target="_blank">the same exception utilities from Starlette</a>.

Let's say you have a custom exception `UnicornException` that you (or a library you use) might `raise`.

And you want to handle this exception globally with FastAPI.

You could add a custom exception handler with `@app.exception_handler()`:

{* ../../docs_src/handling_errors/tutorial003.py hl[5:7,13:18,24] *}

Here, if you request `/unicorns/yolo`, the *path operation* will `raise` a `UnicornException`.

But it will be handled by the `unicorn_exception_handler`.

So, you will receive a clean error, with an HTTP status code of `418` and a JSON content of:

```JSON
{"message": "Oops! yolo did something. There goes a rainbow..."}
```

/// note | Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette.requests import Request` and `from starlette.responses import JSONResponse`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.responses` as `fastapi.responses` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available responses come directly from Starlette. The same with `Request`.

///

## Override the default exception handlers

**FastAPI** has some default exception handlers.

These handlers are in charge of returning the default JSON responses when you `raise` an `HTTPException` and when the request has invalid data.

You can override these exception handlers with your own.

### Override request validation exceptions

When a request contains invalid data, **FastAPI** internally raises a `RequestValidationError`.

And it also includes a default exception handler for it.

To override it, import the `RequestValidationError` and use it with `@app.exception_handler(RequestValidationError)` to decorate the exception handler.

The exception handler will receive a `Request` and the exception.

{* ../../docs_src/handling_errors/tutorial004.py hl[2,14:16] *}

Now, if you go to `/items/foo`, instead of getting the default JSON error with:

```JSON
{
    "detail": [
        {
            "loc": [
                "path",
                "item_id"
            ],
            "msg": "value is not a valid integer",
            "type": "type_error.integer"
        }
    ]
}
```

you will get a text version, with:

```
1 validation error
path -> item_id
  value is not a valid integer (type=type_error.integer)
```

#### `RequestValidationError` vs `ValidationError`

/// warning

These are technical details that you might skip if it's not important for you now.

///

`RequestValidationError` is a sub-class of Pydantic's <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/#error-handling" class="external-link" target="_blank">`ValidationError`</a>.

**FastAPI** uses it so that, if you use a Pydantic model in `response_model`, and your data has an error, you will see the error in your log.

But the client/user will not see it. Instead, the client will receive an "Internal Server Error" with an HTTP status code `500`.

It should be this way because if you have a Pydantic `ValidationError` in your *response* or anywhere in your code (not in the client's *request*), it's actually a bug in your code.

And while you fix it, your clients/users shouldn't have access to internal information about the error, as that could expose a security vulnerability.

### Override the `HTTPException` error handler

The same way, you can override the `HTTPException` handler.

For example, you could want to return a plain text response instead of JSON for these errors:

{* ../../docs_src/handling_errors/tutorial004.py hl[3:4,9:11,22] *}

/// note | Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.responses` as `fastapi.responses` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available responses come directly from Starlette.

///

### Use the `RequestValidationError` body

The `RequestValidationError` contains the `body` it received with invalid data.

You could use it while developing your app to log the body and debug it, return it to the user, etc.

{* ../../docs_src/handling_errors/tutorial005.py hl[14] *}

Now try sending an invalid item like:

```JSON
{
  "title": "towel",
  "size": "XL"
}
```

You will receive a response telling you that the data is invalid containing the received body:

```JSON hl_lines="12-15"
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "loc": [
        "body",
        "size"
      ],
      "msg": "value is not a valid integer",
      "type": "type_error.integer"
    }
  ],
  "body": {
    "title": "towel",
    "size": "XL"
  }
}
```

#### FastAPI's `HTTPException` vs Starlette's `HTTPException`

**FastAPI** has its own `HTTPException`.

And **FastAPI**'s `HTTPException` error class inherits from Starlette's `HTTPException` error class.

The only difference is that **FastAPI**'s `HTTPException` accepts any JSON-able data for the `detail` field, while Starlette's `HTTPException` only accepts strings for it.

So, you can keep raising **FastAPI**'s `HTTPException` as normally in your code.

But when you register an exception handler, you should register it for Starlette's `HTTPException`.

This way, if any part of Starlette's internal code, or a Starlette extension or plug-in, raises a Starlette `HTTPException`, your handler will be able to catch and handle it.

In this example, to be able to have both `HTTPException`s in the same code, Starlette's exceptions is renamed to `StarletteHTTPException`:

```Python
from starlette.exceptions import HTTPException as StarletteHTTPException
```

### Reuse **FastAPI**'s exception handlers

If you want to use the exception along with the same default exception handlers from  **FastAPI**, you can import and reuse the default exception handlers from `fastapi.exception_handlers`:

{* ../../docs_src/handling_errors/tutorial006.py hl[2:5,15,21] *}

In this example you are just printing the error with a very expressive message, but you get the idea. You can use the exception and then just reuse the default exception handlers.

## File: docs/en/docs/tutorial/header-param-models.md
````markdown
# Header Parameter Models

If you have a group of related **header parameters**, you can create a **Pydantic model** to declare them.

This would allow you to **re-use the model** in **multiple places** and also to declare validations and metadata for all the parameters at once. 😎

/// note

This is supported since FastAPI version `0.115.0`. 🤓

///

## Header Parameters with a Pydantic Model

Declare the **header parameters** that you need in a **Pydantic model**, and then declare the parameter as `Header`:

{* ../../docs_src/header_param_models/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[9:14,18] *}

**FastAPI** will **extract** the data for **each field** from the **headers** in the request and give you the Pydantic model you defined.

## Check the Docs

You can see the required headers in the docs UI at `/docs`:

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="/img/tutorial/header-param-models/image01.png">
</div>

## Forbid Extra Headers

In some special use cases (probably not very common), you might want to **restrict** the headers that you want to receive.

You can use Pydantic's model configuration to `forbid` any `extra` fields:

{* ../../docs_src/header_param_models/tutorial002_an_py310.py hl[10] *}

If a client tries to send some **extra headers**, they will receive an **error** response.

For example, if the client tries to send a `tool` header with a value of `plumbus`, they will receive an **error** response telling them that the header parameter `tool` is not allowed:

```json
{
    "detail": [
        {
            "type": "extra_forbidden",
            "loc": ["header", "tool"],
            "msg": "Extra inputs are not permitted",
            "input": "plumbus",
        }
    ]
}
```

## Disable Convert Underscores

The same way as with regular header parameters, when you have underscore characters in the parameter names, they are **automatically converted to hyphens**.

For example, if you have a header parameter `save_data` in the code, the expected HTTP header will be `save-data`, and it will show up like that in the docs.

If for some reason you need to disable this automatic conversion, you can do it as well for Pydantic models for header parameters.

{* ../../docs_src/header_param_models/tutorial003_an_py310.py hl[19] *}

/// warning

Before setting `convert_underscores` to `False`, bear in mind that some HTTP proxies and servers disallow the usage of headers with underscores.

///

## Summary

You can use **Pydantic models** to declare **headers** in **FastAPI**. 😎
````

## File: docs/en/docs/tutorial/header-params.md
````markdown
# Header Parameters

You can define Header parameters the same way you define `Query`, `Path` and `Cookie` parameters.

## Import `Header`

First import `Header`:

{* ../../docs_src/header_params/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[3] *}

## Declare `Header` parameters

Then declare the header parameters using the same structure as with `Path`, `Query` and `Cookie`.

You can define the default value as well as all the extra validation or annotation parameters:

{* ../../docs_src/header_params/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[9] *}

/// note | Technical Details

`Header` is a "sister" class of `Path`, `Query` and `Cookie`. It also inherits from the same common `Param` class.

But remember that when you import `Query`, `Path`, `Header`, and others from `fastapi`, those are actually functions that return special classes.

///

/// info

To declare headers, you need to use `Header`, because otherwise the parameters would be interpreted as query parameters.

///

## Automatic conversion

`Header` has a little extra functionality on top of what `Path`, `Query` and `Cookie` provide.

Most of the standard headers are separated by a "hyphen" character, also known as the "minus symbol" (`-`).

But a variable like `user-agent` is invalid in Python.

So, by default, `Header` will convert the parameter names characters from underscore (`_`) to hyphen (`-`) to extract and document the headers.

Also, HTTP headers are case-insensitive, so, you can declare them with standard Python style (also known as "snake_case").

So, you can use `user_agent` as you normally would in Python code, instead of needing to capitalize the first letters as `User_Agent` or something similar.

If for some reason you need to disable automatic conversion of underscores to hyphens, set the parameter `convert_underscores` of `Header` to `False`:

{* ../../docs_src/header_params/tutorial002_an_py310.py hl[10] *}

/// warning

Before setting `convert_underscores` to `False`, bear in mind that some HTTP proxies and servers disallow the usage of headers with underscores.

///

## Duplicate headers

It is possible to receive duplicate headers. That means, the same header with multiple values.

You can define those cases using a list in the type declaration.

You will receive all the values from the duplicate header as a Python `list`.

For example, to declare a header of `X-Token` that can appear more than once, you can write:

{* ../../docs_src/header_params/tutorial003_an_py310.py hl[9] *}

If you communicate with that *path operation* sending two HTTP headers like:

```
X-Token: foo
X-Token: bar
```

The response would be like:

```JSON
{
    "X-Token values": [
        "bar",
        "foo"
    ]
}
```

## Recap

Declare headers with `Header`, using the same common pattern as `Query`, `Path` and `Cookie`.

And don't worry about underscores in your variables, **FastAPI** will take care of converting them.

# Tutorial - User Guide

This tutorial shows you how to use **FastAPI** with most of its features, step by step.

Each section gradually builds on the previous ones, but it's structured to separate topics, so that you can go directly to any specific one to solve your specific API needs.

It is also built to work as a future reference so you can come back and see exactly what you need.

## Run the code

All the code blocks can be copied and used directly (they are actually tested Python files).

To run any of the examples, copy the code to a file `main.py`, and start `fastapi dev` with:

<div class="termy">

</div>

It is **HIGHLY encouraged** that you write or copy the code, edit it and run it locally.

Using it in your editor is what really shows you the benefits of FastAPI, seeing how little code you have to write, all the type checks, autocompletion, etc.

---

## Install FastAPI

The first step is to install FastAPI.

Make sure you create a [virtual environment](../virtual-environments.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, activate it, and then **install FastAPI**:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install "fastapi[standard]"

---> 100%
```

</div>

/// note

When you install with `pip install "fastapi[standard]"` it comes with some default optional standard dependencies.

If you don't want to have those optional dependencies, you can instead install `pip install fastapi`.

///

## Advanced User Guide

There is also an **Advanced User Guide** that you can read later after this **Tutorial - User guide**.

The **Advanced User Guide** builds on this one, uses the same concepts, and teaches you some extra features.

But you should first read the **Tutorial - User Guide** (what you are reading right now).

It's designed so that you can build a complete application with just the **Tutorial - User Guide**, and then extend it in different ways, depending on your needs, using some of the additional ideas from the **Advanced User Guide**.
````

## File: docs/en/docs/tutorial/metadata.md
````markdown
# Metadata and Docs URLs

You can customize several metadata configurations in your **FastAPI** application.

## Metadata for API

You can set the following fields that are used in the OpenAPI specification and the automatic API docs UIs:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `title` | `str` | The title of the API. |
| `summary` | `str` | A short summary of the API. <small>Available since OpenAPI 3.1.0, FastAPI 0.99.0.</small> |
| `description` | `str` | A short description of the API. It can use Markdown. |
| `version` | `string` | The version of the API. This is the version of your own application, not of OpenAPI. For example `2.5.0`. |
| `terms_of_service` | `str` | A URL to the Terms of Service for the API. If provided, this has to be a URL. |
| `contact` | `dict` | The contact information for the exposed API. It can contain several fields. <details><summary><code>contact</code> fields</summary><table><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>name</code></td><td><code>str</code></td><td>The identifying name of the contact person/organization.</td></tr><tr><td><code>url</code></td><td><code>str</code></td><td>The URL pointing to the contact information. MUST be in the format of a URL.</td></tr><tr><td><code>email</code></td><td><code>str</code></td><td>The email address of the contact person/organization. MUST be in the format of an email address.</td></tr></tbody></table></details> |
| `license_info` | `dict` | The license information for the exposed API. It can contain several fields. <details><summary><code>license_info</code> fields</summary><table><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>name</code></td><td><code>str</code></td><td><strong>REQUIRED</strong> (if a <code>license_info</code> is set). The license name used for the API.</td></tr><tr><td><code>identifier</code></td><td><code>str</code></td><td>An <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/" class="external-link" target="_blank">SPDX</a> license expression for the API. The <code>identifier</code> field is mutually exclusive of the <code>url</code> field. <small>Available since OpenAPI 3.1.0, FastAPI 0.99.0.</small></td></tr><tr><td><code>url</code></td><td><code>str</code></td><td>A URL to the license used for the API. MUST be in the format of a URL.</td></tr></tbody></table></details> |

You can set them as follows:

{* ../../docs_src/metadata/tutorial001.py hl[3:16, 19:32] *}

/// tip

You can write Markdown in the `description` field and it will be rendered in the output.

///

With this configuration, the automatic API docs would look like:

<img src="/img/tutorial/metadata/image01.png">

## License identifier

Since OpenAPI 3.1.0 and FastAPI 0.99.0, you can also set the `license_info` with an `identifier` instead of a `url`.

For example:

{* ../../docs_src/metadata/tutorial001_1.py hl[31] *}

## Metadata for tags

You can also add additional metadata for the different tags used to group your path operations with the parameter `openapi_tags`.

It takes a list containing one dictionary for each tag.

Each dictionary can contain:

* `name` (**required**): a `str` with the same tag name you use in the `tags` parameter in your *path operations* and `APIRouter`s.
* `description`: a `str` with a short description for the tag. It can have Markdown and will be shown in the docs UI.
* `externalDocs`: a `dict` describing external documentation with:
    * `description`: a `str` with a short description for the external docs.
    * `url` (**required**): a `str` with the URL for the external documentation.

### Create metadata for tags

Let's try that in an example with tags for `users` and `items`.

Create metadata for your tags and pass it to the `openapi_tags` parameter:

{* ../../docs_src/metadata/tutorial004.py hl[3:16,18] *}

Notice that you can use Markdown inside of the descriptions, for example "login" will be shown in bold (**login**) and "fancy" will be shown in italics (_fancy_).

/// tip

You don't have to add metadata for all the tags that you use.

///

### Use your tags

Use the `tags` parameter with your *path operations* (and `APIRouter`s) to assign them to different tags:

{* ../../docs_src/metadata/tutorial004.py hl[21,26] *}

/// info

Read more about tags in [Path Operation Configuration](path-operation-configuration.md#tags){.internal-link target=_blank}.

///

### Check the docs

Now, if you check the docs, they will show all the additional metadata:

<img src="/img/tutorial/metadata/image02.png">

### Order of tags

The order of each tag metadata dictionary also defines the order shown in the docs UI.

For example, even though `users` would go after `items` in alphabetical order, it is shown before them, because we added their metadata as the first dictionary in the list.

## OpenAPI URL

By default, the OpenAPI schema is served at `/openapi.json`.

But you can configure it with the parameter `openapi_url`.

For example, to set it to be served at `/api/v1/openapi.json`:

{* ../../docs_src/metadata/tutorial002.py hl[3] *}

If you want to disable the OpenAPI schema completely you can set `openapi_url=None`, that will also disable the documentation user interfaces that use it.

## Docs URLs

You can configure the two documentation user interfaces included:

* **Swagger UI**: served at `/docs`.
    * You can set its URL with the parameter `docs_url`.
    * You can disable it by setting `docs_url=None`.
* **ReDoc**: served at `/redoc`.
    * You can set its URL with the parameter `redoc_url`.
    * You can disable it by setting `redoc_url=None`.

For example, to set Swagger UI to be served at `/documentation` and disable ReDoc:

{* ../../docs_src/metadata/tutorial003.py hl[3] *}
````

## File: docs/en/docs/tutorial/middleware.md
````markdown
# Middleware

You can add middleware to **FastAPI** applications.

A "middleware" is a function that works with every **request** before it is processed by any specific *path operation*. And also with every **response** before returning it.

* It takes each **request** that comes to your application.
* It can then do something to that **request** or run any needed code.
* Then it passes the **request** to be processed by the rest of the application (by some *path operation*).
* It then takes the **response** generated by the application (by some *path operation*).
* It can do something to that **response** or run any needed code.
* Then it returns the **response**.

/// note | Technical Details

If you have dependencies with `yield`, the exit code will run *after* the middleware.

If there were any background tasks (covered in the [Background Tasks](background-tasks.md){.internal-link target=_blank} section, you will see it later), they will run *after* all the middleware.

///

## Create a middleware

To create a middleware you use the decorator `@app.middleware("http")` on top of a function.

The middleware function receives:

* The `request`.
* A function `call_next` that will receive the `request` as a parameter.
    * This function will pass the `request` to the corresponding *path operation*.
    * Then it returns the `response` generated by the corresponding *path operation*.
* You can then further modify the `response` before returning it.

{* ../../docs_src/middleware/tutorial001.py hl[8:9,11,14] *}

/// tip

Keep in mind that custom proprietary headers can be added <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers" class="external-link" target="_blank">using the 'X-' prefix</a>.

But if you have custom headers that you want a client in a browser to be able to see, you need to add them to your CORS configurations ([CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)](cors.md){.internal-link target=_blank}) using the parameter `expose_headers` documented in <a href="https://www.starlette.io/middleware/#corsmiddleware" class="external-link" target="_blank">Starlette's CORS docs</a>.

///

/// note | Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette.requests import Request`.

**FastAPI** provides it as a convenience for you, the developer. But it comes directly from Starlette.

///

### Before and after the `response`

You can add code to be run with the `request`,  before any *path operation* receives it.

And also after the `response` is generated, before returning it.

For example, you could add a custom header `X-Process-Time` containing the time in seconds that it took to process the request and generate a response:

{* ../../docs_src/middleware/tutorial001.py hl[10,12:13] *}

/// tip

Here we use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.perf_counter" class="external-link" target="_blank">`time.perf_counter()`</a> instead of `time.time()` because it can be more precise for these use cases. 🤓

///

## Multiple middleware execution order

When you add multiple middlewares using either `@app.middleware()` decorator or `app.add_middleware()` method, each new middleware wraps the application, forming a stack. The last middleware added is the *outermost*, and the first is the *innermost*.

On the request path, the *outermost* middleware runs first.

On the response path, it runs last.

For example:

```Python
app.add_middleware(MiddlewareA)
app.add_middleware(MiddlewareB)
```

This results in the following execution order:

* **Request**: MiddlewareB → MiddlewareA → route

* **Response**: route → MiddlewareA → MiddlewareB

This stacking behavior ensures that middlewares are executed in a predictable and controllable order.

## Other middlewares

You can later read more about other middlewares in the [Advanced User Guide: Advanced Middleware](../advanced/middleware.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

You will read about how to handle <abbr title="Cross-Origin Resource Sharing">CORS</abbr> with a middleware in the next section.

## File: docs/en/docs/tutorial/path-operation-configuration.md
````markdown
# Path Operation Configuration

There are several parameters that you can pass to your *path operation decorator* to configure it.

/// warning

Notice that these parameters are passed directly to the *path operation decorator*, not to your *path operation function*.

///

## Response Status Code

You can define the (HTTP) `status_code` to be used in the response of your *path operation*.

You can pass directly the `int` code, like `404`.

But if you don't remember what each number code is for, you can use the shortcut constants in `status`:

{* ../../docs_src/path_operation_configuration/tutorial001_py310.py hl[1,15] *}

That status code will be used in the response and will be added to the OpenAPI schema.

/// note | Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette import status`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.status` as `fastapi.status` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But it comes directly from Starlette.

///

## Tags

You can add tags to your *path operation*, pass the parameter `tags` with a `list` of `str` (commonly just one `str`):

{* ../../docs_src/path_operation_configuration/tutorial002_py310.py hl[15,20,25] *}

They will be added to the OpenAPI schema and used by the automatic documentation interfaces:

<img src="/img/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/image01.png">

### Tags with Enums

If you have a big application, you might end up accumulating **several tags**, and you would want to make sure you always use the **same tag** for related *path operations*.

In these cases, it could make sense to store the tags in an `Enum`.

**FastAPI** supports that the same way as with plain strings:

{* ../../docs_src/path_operation_configuration/tutorial002b.py hl[1,8:10,13,18] *}

## Summary and description

You can add a `summary` and `description`:

{* ../../docs_src/path_operation_configuration/tutorial003_py310.py hl[18:19] *}

## Description from docstring

As descriptions tend to be long and cover multiple lines, you can declare the *path operation* description in the function <abbr title="a multi-line string as the first expression inside a function (not assigned to any variable) used for documentation">docstring</abbr> and **FastAPI** will read it from there.

You can write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" class="external-link" target="_blank">Markdown</a> in the docstring, it will be interpreted and displayed correctly (taking into account docstring indentation).

{* ../../docs_src/path_operation_configuration/tutorial004_py310.py hl[17:25] *}

It will be used in the interactive docs:

<img src="/img/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/image02.png">

## Response description

You can specify the response description with the parameter `response_description`:

{* ../../docs_src/path_operation_configuration/tutorial005_py310.py hl[19] *}

/// info

Notice that `response_description` refers specifically to the response, the `description` refers to the *path operation* in general.

///

/// check

OpenAPI specifies that each *path operation* requires a response description.

So, if you don't provide one, **FastAPI** will automatically generate one of "Successful response".

///

## Deprecate a *path operation*

If you need to mark a *path operation* as <abbr title="obsolete, recommended not to use it">deprecated</abbr>, but without removing it, pass the parameter `deprecated`:

{* ../../docs_src/path_operation_configuration/tutorial006.py hl[16] *}

It will be clearly marked as deprecated in the interactive docs:

<img src="/img/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/image04.png">

Check how deprecated and non-deprecated *path operations* look like:

## Recap

You can configure and add metadata for your *path operations* easily by passing parameters to the *path operation decorators*.

# Path Parameters and Numeric Validations

In the same way that you can declare more validations and metadata for query parameters with `Query`, you can declare the same type of validations and metadata for path parameters with `Path`.

## Import Path

First, import `Path` from `fastapi`, and import `Annotated`:

{* ../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[1,3] *}

/// info

FastAPI added support for `Annotated` (and started recommending it) in version 0.95.0.

If you have an older version, you would get errors when trying to use `Annotated`.

Make sure you [Upgrade the FastAPI version](../deployment/versions.md#upgrading-the-fastapi-versions){.internal-link target=_blank} to at least 0.95.1 before using `Annotated`.

///

## Declare metadata

You can declare all the same parameters as for `Query`.

For example, to declare a `title` metadata value for the path parameter `item_id` you can type:

{* ../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[10] *}

/// note

A path parameter is always required as it has to be part of the path. Even if you declared it with `None` or set a default value, it would not affect anything, it would still be always required.

///

## Order the parameters as you need

/// tip

This is probably not as important or necessary if you use `Annotated`.

///

Let's say that you want to declare the query parameter `q` as a required `str`.

And you don't need to declare anything else for that parameter, so you don't really need to use `Query`.

But you still need to use `Path` for the `item_id` path parameter. And you don't want to use `Annotated` for some reason.

Python will complain if you put a value with a "default" before a value that doesn't have a "default".

But you can re-order them, and have the value without a default (the query parameter `q`) first.

It doesn't matter for **FastAPI**. It will detect the parameters by their names, types and default declarations (`Query`, `Path`, etc), it doesn't care about the order.

So, you can declare your function as:

//// tab | Python 3.8 non-Annotated

/// tip

Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

///

{* ../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial002.py hl[7] *}

////

But keep in mind that if you use `Annotated`, you won't have this problem, it won't matter as you're not using the function parameter default values for `Query()` or `Path()`.

{* ../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial002_an_py39.py *}

## Order the parameters as you need, tricks

/// tip

This is probably not as important or necessary if you use `Annotated`.

///

Here's a **small trick** that can be handy, but you won't need it often.

If you want to:

* declare the `q` query parameter without a `Query` nor any default value
* declare the path parameter `item_id` using `Path`
* have them in a different order
* not use `Annotated`

...Python has a little special syntax for that.

Pass `*`, as the first parameter of the function.

Python won't do anything with that `*`, but it will know that all the following parameters should be called as keyword arguments (key-value pairs), also known as <abbr title="From: K-ey W-ord Arg-uments"><code>kwargs</code></abbr>. Even if they don't have a default value.

{* ../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial003.py hl[7] *}

### Better with `Annotated`

Keep in mind that if you use `Annotated`, as you are not using function parameter default values, you won't have this problem, and you probably won't need to use `*`.

{* ../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial003_an_py39.py hl[10] *}

## Number validations: greater than or equal

With `Query` and `Path` (and others you'll see later) you can declare number constraints.

Here, with `ge=1`, `item_id` will need to be an integer number "`g`reater than or `e`qual" to `1`.

{* ../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial004_an_py39.py hl[10] *}

## Number validations: greater than and less than or equal

The same applies for:

* `gt`: `g`reater `t`han
* `le`: `l`ess than or `e`qual

{* ../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial005_an_py39.py hl[10] *}

## Number validations: floats, greater than and less than

Number validations also work for `float` values.

Here's where it becomes important to be able to declare <abbr title="greater than"><code>gt</code></abbr> and not just <abbr title="greater than or equal"><code>ge</code></abbr>. As with it you can require, for example, that a value must be greater than `0`, even if it is less than `1`.

So, `0.5` would be a valid value. But `0.0` or `0` would not.

And the same for <abbr title="less than"><code>lt</code></abbr>.

{* ../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial006_an_py39.py hl[13] *}

## Recap

With `Query`, `Path` (and others you haven't seen yet) you can declare metadata and string validations in the same ways as with [Query Parameters and String Validations](query-params-str-validations.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

And you can also declare numeric validations:

* `gt`: `g`reater `t`han
* `ge`: `g`reater than or `e`qual
* `lt`: `l`ess `t`han
* `le`: `l`ess than or `e`qual

/// info

`Query`, `Path`, and other classes you will see later are subclasses of a common `Param` class.

All of them share the same parameters for additional validation and metadata you have seen.

///

/// note | Technical Details

When you import `Query`, `Path` and others from `fastapi`, they are actually functions.

That when called, return instances of classes of the same name.

So, you import `Query`, which is a function. And when you call it, it returns an instance of a class also named `Query`.

These functions are there (instead of just using the classes directly) so that your editor doesn't mark errors about their types.

That way you can use your normal editor and coding tools without having to add custom configurations to disregard those errors.

///
````

## File: docs/en/docs/tutorial/path-params.md
````markdown
# Path Parameters

You can declare path "parameters" or "variables" with the same syntax used by Python format strings:

{* ../../docs_src/path_params/tutorial001.py hl[6:7] *}

The value of the path parameter `item_id` will be passed to your function as the argument `item_id`.

So, if you run this example and go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo</a>, you will see a response of:

```JSON
{"item_id":"foo"}
```

## Path parameters with types

You can declare the type of a path parameter in the function, using standard Python type annotations:

{* ../../docs_src/path_params/tutorial002.py hl[7] *}

In this case, `item_id` is declared to be an `int`.

/// check

This will give you editor support inside of your function, with error checks, completion, etc.

///

## Data <abbr title="also known as: serialization, parsing, marshalling">conversion</abbr>

If you run this example and open your browser at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/3" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/3</a>, you will see a response of:

```JSON
{"item_id":3}
```

/// check

Notice that the value your function received (and returned) is `3`, as a Python `int`, not a string `"3"`.

So, with that type declaration, **FastAPI** gives you automatic request <abbr title="converting the string that comes from an HTTP request into Python data">"parsing"</abbr>.

///

## Data validation

But if you go to the browser at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo</a>, you will see a nice HTTP error of:

```JSON
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "type": "int_parsing",
      "loc": [
        "path",
        "item_id"
      ],
      "msg": "Input should be a valid integer, unable to parse string as an integer",
      "input": "foo",
      "url": "https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.1/v/int_parsing"
    }
  ]
}
```

because the path parameter `item_id` had a value of `"foo"`, which is not an `int`.

The same error would appear if you provided a `float` instead of an `int`, as in: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/4.2" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/4.2</a>

/// check

So, with the same Python type declaration, **FastAPI** gives you data validation.

Notice that the error also clearly states exactly the point where the validation didn't pass.

This is incredibly helpful while developing and debugging code that interacts with your API.

///

## Documentation

And when you open your browser at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>, you will see an automatic, interactive, API documentation like:

<img src="/img/tutorial/path-params/image01.png">

/// check

Again, just with that same Python type declaration, **FastAPI** gives you automatic, interactive documentation (integrating Swagger UI).

Notice that the path parameter is declared to be an integer.

///

## Standards-based benefits, alternative documentation

And because the generated schema is from the <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.1.0.md" class="external-link" target="_blank">OpenAPI</a> standard, there are many compatible tools.

Because of this, **FastAPI** itself provides an alternative API documentation (using ReDoc), which you can access at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc</a>:

<img src="/img/tutorial/path-params/image02.png">

The same way, there are many compatible tools. Including code generation tools for many languages.

## Pydantic

All the data validation is performed under the hood by <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic</a>, so you get all the benefits from it. And you know you are in good hands.

You can use the same type declarations with `str`, `float`, `bool` and many other complex data types.

Several of these are explored in the next chapters of the tutorial.

## Order matters

When creating *path operations*, you can find situations where you have a fixed path.

Like `/users/me`, let's say that it's to get data about the current user.

And then you can also have a path `/users/{user_id}` to get data about a specific user by some user ID.

Because *path operations* are evaluated in order, you need to make sure that the path for `/users/me` is declared before the one for `/users/{user_id}`:

{* ../../docs_src/path_params/tutorial003.py hl[6,11] *}

Otherwise, the path for `/users/{user_id}` would match also for `/users/me`, "thinking" that it's receiving a parameter `user_id` with a value of `"me"`.

Similarly, you cannot redefine a path operation:

{* ../../docs_src/path_params/tutorial003b.py hl[6,11] *}

The first one will always be used since the path matches first.

## Predefined values

If you have a *path operation* that receives a *path parameter*, but you want the possible valid *path parameter* values to be predefined, you can use a standard Python <abbr title="Enumeration">`Enum`</abbr>.

### Create an `Enum` class

Import `Enum` and create a sub-class that inherits from `str` and from `Enum`.

By inheriting from `str` the API docs will be able to know that the values must be of type `string` and will be able to render correctly.

Then create class attributes with fixed values, which will be the available valid values:

{* ../../docs_src/path_params/tutorial005.py hl[1,6:9] *}

/// info

<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html" class="external-link" target="_blank">Enumerations (or enums) are available in Python</a> since version 3.4.

///

/// tip

If you are wondering, "AlexNet", "ResNet", and "LeNet" are just names of Machine Learning <abbr title="Technically, Deep Learning model architectures">models</abbr>.

///

### Declare a *path parameter*

Then create a *path parameter* with a type annotation using the enum class you created (`ModelName`):

{* ../../docs_src/path_params/tutorial005.py hl[16] *}

### Check the docs

Because the available values for the *path parameter* are predefined, the interactive docs can show them nicely:

<img src="/img/tutorial/path-params/image03.png">

### Working with Python *enumerations*

The value of the *path parameter* will be an *enumeration member*.

#### Compare *enumeration members*

You can compare it with the *enumeration member* in your created enum `ModelName`:

{* ../../docs_src/path_params/tutorial005.py hl[17] *}

#### Get the *enumeration value*

You can get the actual value (a `str` in this case) using `model_name.value`, or in general, `your_enum_member.value`:

{* ../../docs_src/path_params/tutorial005.py hl[20] *}

/// tip

You could also access the value `"lenet"` with `ModelName.lenet.value`.

///

#### Return *enumeration members*

You can return *enum members* from your *path operation*, even nested in a JSON body (e.g. a `dict`).

They will be converted to their corresponding values (strings in this case) before returning them to the client:

{* ../../docs_src/path_params/tutorial005.py hl[18,21,23] *}

In your client you will get a JSON response like:

```JSON
{
  "model_name": "alexnet",
  "message": "Deep Learning FTW!"
}
```

## Path parameters containing paths

Let's say you have a *path operation* with a path `/files/{file_path}`.

But you need `file_path` itself to contain a *path*, like `home/johndoe/myfile.txt`.

So, the URL for that file would be something like: `/files/home/johndoe/myfile.txt`.

### OpenAPI support

OpenAPI doesn't support a way to declare a *path parameter* to contain a *path* inside, as that could lead to scenarios that are difficult to test and define.

Nevertheless, you can still do it in **FastAPI**, using one of the internal tools from Starlette.

And the docs would still work, although not adding any documentation telling that the parameter should contain a path.

### Path convertor

Using an option directly from Starlette you can declare a *path parameter* containing a *path* using a URL like:

```
/files/{file_path:path}
```

In this case, the name of the parameter is `file_path`, and the last part, `:path`, tells it that the parameter should match any *path*.

So, you can use it with:

{* ../../docs_src/path_params/tutorial004.py hl[6] *}

/// tip

You could need the parameter to contain `/home/johndoe/myfile.txt`, with a leading slash (`/`).

In that case, the URL would be: `/files//home/johndoe/myfile.txt`, with a double slash (`//`) between `files` and `home`.

///

## Recap

With **FastAPI**, by using short, intuitive and standard Python type declarations, you get:

* Editor support: error checks, autocompletion, etc.
* Data "<abbr title="converting the string that comes from an HTTP request into Python data">parsing</abbr>"
* Data validation
* API annotation and automatic documentation

And you only have to declare them once.

That's probably the main visible advantage of **FastAPI** compared to alternative frameworks (apart from the raw performance).

## File: docs/en/docs/tutorial/query-param-models.md
````markdown
# Query Parameter Models

If you have a group of **query parameters** that are related, you can create a **Pydantic model** to declare them.

This would allow you to **re-use the model** in **multiple places** and also to declare validations and metadata for all the parameters at once. 😎

/// note

This is supported since FastAPI version `0.115.0`. 🤓

///

## Query Parameters with a Pydantic Model

Declare the **query parameters** that you need in a **Pydantic model**, and then declare the parameter as `Query`:

{* ../../docs_src/query_param_models/tutorial001_an_py310.py hl[9:13,17] *}

**FastAPI** will **extract** the data for **each field** from the **query parameters** in the request and give you the Pydantic model you defined.

## Check the Docs

You can see the query parameters in the docs UI at `/docs`:

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="/img/tutorial/query-param-models/image01.png">
</div>

## Forbid Extra Query Parameters

In some special use cases (probably not very common), you might want to **restrict** the query parameters that you want to receive.

You can use Pydantic's model configuration to `forbid` any `extra` fields:

{* ../../docs_src/query_param_models/tutorial002_an_py310.py hl[10] *}

If a client tries to send some **extra** data in the **query parameters**, they will receive an **error** response.

For example, if the client tries to send a `tool` query parameter with a value of `plumbus`, like:

```http
https://example.com/items/?limit=10&tool=plumbus
```

They will receive an **error** response telling them that the query parameter `tool` is not allowed:

```json
{
    "detail": [
        {
            "type": "extra_forbidden",
            "loc": ["query", "tool"],
            "msg": "Extra inputs are not permitted",
            "input": "plumbus"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Summary

You can use **Pydantic models** to declare **query parameters** in **FastAPI**. 😎

/// tip

Spoiler alert: you can also use Pydantic models to declare cookies and headers, but you will read about that later in the tutorial. 🤫

///

## File: docs/en/docs/tutorial/query-params-str-validations.md
````markdown
# Query Parameters and String Validations

**FastAPI** allows you to declare additional information and validation for your parameters.

Let's take this application as example:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial001_py310.py hl[7] *}

The query parameter `q` is of type `str | None`, that means that it's of type `str` but could also be `None`, and indeed, the default value is `None`, so FastAPI will know it's not required.

/// note

FastAPI will know that the value of `q` is not required because of the default value `= None`.

Having `str | None` will allow your editor to give you better support and detect errors.

///

## Additional validation

We are going to enforce that even though `q` is optional, whenever it is provided, **its length doesn't exceed 50 characters**.

### Import `Query` and `Annotated`

To achieve that, first import:

* `Query` from `fastapi`
* `Annotated` from `typing`

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial002_an_py310.py hl[1,3] *}

/// info

FastAPI added support for `Annotated` (and started recommending it) in version 0.95.0.

If you have an older version, you would get errors when trying to use `Annotated`.

Make sure you [Upgrade the FastAPI version](../deployment/versions.md#upgrading-the-fastapi-versions){.internal-link target=_blank} to at least 0.95.1 before using `Annotated`.

///

## Use `Annotated` in the type for the `q` parameter

Remember I told you before that `Annotated` can be used to add metadata to your parameters in the [Python Types Intro](../python-types.md#type-hints-with-metadata-annotations){.internal-link target=_blank}?

Now it's the time to use it with FastAPI. 🚀

We had this type annotation:

//// tab | Python 3.10+

```Python
q: str | None = None
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python
q: Union[str, None] = None
```

////

What we will do is wrap that with `Annotated`, so it becomes:

//// tab | Python 3.10+

```Python
q: Annotated[str | None] = None
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python
q: Annotated[Union[str, None]] = None
```

////

Both of those versions mean the same thing, `q` is a parameter that can be a `str` or `None`, and by default, it is `None`.

Now let's jump to the fun stuff. 🎉

## Add `Query` to `Annotated` in the `q` parameter

Now that we have this `Annotated` where we can put more information (in this case some additional validation), add `Query` inside of `Annotated`, and set the parameter `max_length` to `50`:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial002_an_py310.py hl[9] *}

Notice that the default value is still `None`, so the parameter is still optional.

But now, having `Query(max_length=50)` inside of `Annotated`, we are telling FastAPI that we want it to have **additional validation** for this value, we want it to have maximum 50 characters. 😎

/// tip

Here we are using `Query()` because this is a **query parameter**. Later we will see others like `Path()`, `Body()`, `Header()`, and `Cookie()`, that also accept the same arguments as `Query()`.

///

FastAPI will now:

* **Validate** the data making sure that the max length is 50 characters
* Show a **clear error** for the client when the data is not valid
* **Document** the parameter in the OpenAPI schema *path operation* (so it will show up in the **automatic docs UI**)

## Alternative (old): `Query` as the default value

Previous versions of FastAPI (before <abbr title="before 2023-03">0.95.0</abbr>) required you to use `Query` as the default value of your parameter, instead of putting it in `Annotated`, there's a high chance that you will see code using it around, so I'll explain it to you.

/// tip

For new code and whenever possible, use `Annotated` as explained above. There are multiple advantages (explained below) and no disadvantages. 🍰

///

This is how you would use `Query()` as the default value of your function parameter, setting the parameter `max_length` to 50:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial002_py310.py hl[7] *}

As in this case (without using `Annotated`) we have to replace the default value `None` in the function with `Query()`, we now need to set the default value with the parameter `Query(default=None)`, it serves the same purpose of defining that default value (at least for FastAPI).

So:

```Python
q: str | None = Query(default=None)
```

...makes the parameter optional, with a default value of `None`, the same as:


```Python
q: str | None = None
```

But the `Query` version declares it explicitly as being a query parameter.

Then, we can pass more parameters to `Query`. In this case, the `max_length` parameter that applies to strings:

```Python
q: str | None = Query(default=None, max_length=50)
```

This will validate the data, show a clear error when the data is not valid, and document the parameter in the OpenAPI schema *path operation*.

### `Query` as the default value or in `Annotated`

Keep in mind that when using `Query` inside of `Annotated` you cannot use the `default` parameter for `Query`.

Instead, use the actual default value of the function parameter. Otherwise, it would be inconsistent.

For example, this is not allowed:

```Python
q: Annotated[str, Query(default="rick")] = "morty"
```

...because it's not clear if the default value should be `"rick"` or `"morty"`.

So, you would use (preferably):

```Python
q: Annotated[str, Query()] = "rick"
```

...or in older code bases you will find:

```Python
q: str = Query(default="rick")
```

### Advantages of `Annotated`

**Using `Annotated` is recommended** instead of the default value in function parameters, it is **better** for multiple reasons. 🤓

The **default** value of the **function parameter** is the **actual default** value, that's more intuitive with Python in general. 😌

You could **call** that same function in **other places** without FastAPI, and it would **work as expected**. If there's a **required** parameter (without a default value), your **editor** will let you know with an error, **Python** will also complain if you run it without passing the required parameter.

When you don't use `Annotated` and instead use the **(old) default value style**, if you call that function without FastAPI in **other places**, you have to **remember** to pass the arguments to the function for it to work correctly, otherwise the values will be different from what you expect (e.g. `QueryInfo` or something similar instead of `str`). And your editor won't complain, and Python won't complain running that function, only when the operations inside error out.

Because `Annotated` can have more than one metadata annotation, you could now even use the same function with other tools, like <a href="https://typer.tiangolo.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Typer</a>. 🚀

## Add more validations

You can also add a parameter `min_length`:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial003_an_py310.py hl[10] *}

## Add regular expressions

You can define a <abbr title="A regular expression, regex or regexp is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern for strings.">regular expression</abbr> `pattern` that the parameter should match:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial004_an_py310.py hl[11] *}

This specific regular expression pattern checks that the received parameter value:

* `^`: starts with the following characters, doesn't have characters before.
* `fixedquery`: has the exact value `fixedquery`.
* `$`: ends there, doesn't have any more characters after `fixedquery`.

If you feel lost with all these **"regular expression"** ideas, don't worry. They are a hard topic for many people. You can still do a lot of stuff without needing regular expressions yet.

Now you know that whenever you need them you can use them in **FastAPI**.

### Pydantic v1 `regex` instead of `pattern`

Before Pydantic version 2 and before FastAPI 0.100.0, the parameter was called `regex` instead of `pattern`, but it's now deprecated.

You could still see some code using it:

//// tab | Pydantic v1

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial004_regex_an_py310.py hl[11] *}

////

But know that this is deprecated and it should be updated to use the new parameter `pattern`. 🤓

## Default values

You can, of course, use default values other than `None`.

Let's say that you want to declare the `q` query parameter to have a `min_length` of `3`, and to have a default value of `"fixedquery"`:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial005_an_py39.py hl[9] *}

/// note

Having a default value of any type, including `None`, makes the parameter optional (not required).

///

## Required parameters

When we don't need to declare more validations or metadata, we can make the `q` query parameter required just by not declaring a default value, like:

```Python
q: str
```

instead of:

```Python
q: str | None = None
```

But we are now declaring it with `Query`, for example like:

//// tab | Annotated

```Python
q: Annotated[str | None, Query(min_length=3)] = None
```

////

So, when you need to declare a value as required while using `Query`, you can simply not declare a default value:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial006_an_py39.py hl[9] *}

### Required, can be `None`

You can declare that a parameter can accept `None`, but that it's still required. This would force clients to send a value, even if the value is `None`.

To do that, you can declare that `None` is a valid type but simply do not declare a default value:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial006c_an_py310.py hl[9] *}

## Query parameter list / multiple values

When you define a query parameter explicitly with `Query` you can also declare it to receive a list of values, or said in another way, to receive multiple values.

For example, to declare a query parameter `q` that can appear multiple times in the URL, you can write:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial011_an_py310.py hl[9] *}

Then, with a URL like:

```
http://localhost:8000/items/?q=foo&q=bar
```

you would receive the multiple `q` *query parameters'* values (`foo` and `bar`) in a Python `list` inside your *path operation function*, in the *function parameter* `q`.

So, the response to that URL would be:

```JSON
{
  "q": [
    "foo",
    "bar"
  ]
}
```

/// tip

To declare a query parameter with a type of `list`, like in the example above, you need to explicitly use `Query`, otherwise it would be interpreted as a request body.

///

The interactive API docs will update accordingly, to allow multiple values:

<img src="/img/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/image02.png">

### Query parameter list / multiple values with defaults

You can also define a default `list` of values if none are provided:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial012_an_py39.py hl[9] *}

If you go to:

```
http://localhost:8000/items/
```

the default of `q` will be: `["foo", "bar"]` and your response will be:

```JSON
{
  "q": [
    "foo",
    "bar"
  ]
}
```

#### Using just `list`

You can also use `list` directly instead of `list[str]`:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial013_an_py39.py hl[9] *}

/// note

Keep in mind that in this case, FastAPI won't check the contents of the list.

For example, `list[int]` would check (and document) that the contents of the list are integers. But `list` alone wouldn't.

///

## Declare more metadata

You can add more information about the parameter.

That information will be included in the generated OpenAPI and used by the documentation user interfaces and external tools.

/// note

Keep in mind that different tools might have different levels of OpenAPI support.

Some of them might not show all the extra information declared yet, although in most of the cases, the missing feature is already planned for development.

///

You can add a `title`:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial007_an_py310.py hl[10] *}

And a `description`:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial008_an_py310.py hl[14] *}

## Alias parameters

Imagine that you want the parameter to be `item-query`.

Like in:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/?item-query=foobaritems
```

But `item-query` is not a valid Python variable name.

The closest would be `item_query`.

But you still need it to be exactly `item-query`...

Then you can declare an `alias`, and that alias is what will be used to find the parameter value:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial009_an_py310.py hl[9] *}

## Deprecating parameters

Now let's say you don't like this parameter anymore.

You have to leave it there a while because there are clients using it, but you want the docs to clearly show it as <abbr title="obsolete, recommended not to use it">deprecated</abbr>.

Then pass the parameter `deprecated=True` to `Query`:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial010_an_py310.py hl[19] *}

The docs will show it like this:

<img src="/img/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/image01.png">

## Exclude parameters from OpenAPI

To exclude a query parameter from the generated OpenAPI schema (and thus, from the automatic documentation systems), set the parameter `include_in_schema` of `Query` to `False`:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial014_an_py310.py hl[10] *}

## Custom Validation

There could be cases where you need to do some **custom validation** that can't be done with the parameters shown above.

In those cases, you can use a **custom validator function** that is applied after the normal validation (e.g. after validating that the value is a `str`).

You can achieve that using <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/validators/#field-after-validator" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic's `AfterValidator`</a> inside of `Annotated`.

/// tip

Pydantic also has <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/validators/#field-before-validator" class="external-link" target="_blank">`BeforeValidator`</a> and others. 🤓

///

For example, this custom validator checks that the item ID starts with `isbn-` for an <abbr title="ISBN means International Standard Book Number">ISBN</abbr> book number or with `imdb-` for an <abbr title="IMDB (Internet Movie Database) is a website with information about movies">IMDB</abbr> movie URL ID:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial015_an_py310.py hl[5,16:19,24] *}

/// info

This is available with Pydantic version 2 or above. 😎

///

/// tip

If you need to do any type of validation that requires communicating with any **external component**, like a database or another API, you should instead use **FastAPI Dependencies**, you will learn about them later.

These custom validators are for things that can be checked with **only** the **same data** provided in the request.

///

### Understand that Code

The important point is just using **`AfterValidator` with a function inside `Annotated`**. Feel free to skip this part. 🤸

---

But if you're curious about this specific code example and you're still entertained, here are some extra details.

#### String with `value.startswith()`

Did you notice? a string using `value.startswith()` can take a tuple, and it will check each value in the tuple:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial015_an_py310.py ln[16:19] hl[17] *}

#### A Random Item

With `data.items()` we get an <abbr title="Something we can iterate on with a for loop, like a list, set, etc.">iterable object</abbr> with tuples containing the key and value for each dictionary item.

We convert this iterable object into a proper `list` with `list(data.items())`.

Then with `random.choice()` we can get a **random value** from the list, so, we get a tuple with `(id, name)`. It will be something like `("imdb-tt0371724", "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy")`.

Then we **assign those two values** of the tuple to the variables `id` and `name`.

So, if the user didn't provide an item ID, they will still receive a random suggestion.

...we do all this in a **single simple line**. 🤯 Don't you love Python? 🐍

{* ../../docs_src/query_params_str_validations/tutorial015_an_py310.py ln[22:30] hl[29] *}

## Recap

You can declare additional validations and metadata for your parameters.

Generic validations and metadata:

* `alias`
* `title`
* `description`
* `deprecated`

Validations specific for strings:

* `min_length`
* `max_length`
* `pattern`

Custom validations using `AfterValidator`.

In these examples you saw how to declare validations for `str` values.

See the next chapters to learn how to declare validations for other types, like numbers.

# Query Parameters

When you declare other function parameters that are not part of the path parameters, they are automatically interpreted as "query" parameters.

{* ../../docs_src/query_params/tutorial001.py hl[9] *}

The query is the set of key-value pairs that go after the `?` in a URL, separated by `&` characters.

For example, in the URL:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/?skip=0&limit=10
```

...the query parameters are:

* `skip`: with a value of `0`
* `limit`: with a value of `10`

As they are part of the URL, they are "naturally" strings.

But when you declare them with Python types (in the example above, as `int`), they are converted to that type and validated against it.

All the same process that applied for path parameters also applies for query parameters:

* Editor support (obviously)
* Data <abbr title="converting the string that comes from an HTTP request into Python data">"parsing"</abbr>
* Data validation
* Automatic documentation

## Defaults

As query parameters are not a fixed part of a path, they can be optional and can have default values.

In the example above they have default values of `skip=0` and `limit=10`.

So, going to the URL:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/
```

would be the same as going to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/?skip=0&limit=10
```

But if you go to, for example:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/?skip=20
```

The parameter values in your function will be:

* `skip=20`: because you set it in the URL
* `limit=10`: because that was the default value

## Optional parameters

The same way, you can declare optional query parameters, by setting their default to `None`:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params/tutorial002_py310.py hl[7] *}

In this case, the function parameter `q` will be optional, and will be `None` by default.

/// check

Also notice that **FastAPI** is smart enough to notice that the path parameter `item_id` is a path parameter and `q` is not, so, it's a query parameter.

///

## Query parameter type conversion

You can also declare `bool` types, and they will be converted:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params/tutorial003_py310.py hl[7] *}

In this case, if you go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?short=1
```

or

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?short=True
```

or

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?short=true
```

or

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?short=on
```

or

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?short=yes
```

or any other case variation (uppercase, first letter in uppercase, etc), your function will see the parameter `short` with a `bool` value of `True`. Otherwise as `False`.


## Multiple path and query parameters

You can declare multiple path parameters and query parameters at the same time, **FastAPI** knows which is which.

And you don't have to declare them in any specific order.

They will be detected by name:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params/tutorial004_py310.py hl[6,8] *}

## Required query parameters

When you declare a default value for non-path parameters (for now, we have only seen query parameters), then it is not required.

If you don't want to add a specific value but just make it optional, set the default as `None`.

But when you want to make a query parameter required, you can just not declare any default value:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params/tutorial005.py hl[6:7] *}

Here the query parameter `needy` is a required query parameter of type `str`.

If you open in your browser a URL like:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo-item
```

...without adding the required parameter `needy`, you will see an error like:

```JSON
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "type": "missing",
      "loc": [
        "query",
        "needy"
      ],
      "msg": "Field required",
      "input": null,
      "url": "https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.1/v/missing"
    }
  ]
}
```

As `needy` is a required parameter, you would need to set it in the URL:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo-item?needy=sooooneedy
```

...this would work:

```JSON
{
    "item_id": "foo-item",
    "needy": "sooooneedy"
}
```

And of course, you can define some parameters as required, some as having a default value, and some entirely optional:

{* ../../docs_src/query_params/tutorial006_py310.py hl[8] *}

In this case, there are 3 query parameters:

* `needy`, a required `str`.
* `skip`, an `int` with a default value of `0`.
* `limit`, an optional `int`.

/// tip

You could also use `Enum`s the same way as with [Path Parameters](path-params.md#predefined-values){.internal-link target=_blank}.

# Request Files

You can define files to be uploaded by the client using `File`.

/// info

To receive uploaded files, first install <a href="https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart" class="external-link" target="_blank">`python-multipart`</a>.

Make sure you create a [virtual environment](../virtual-environments.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, activate it, and then install it, for example:

```console
$ pip install python-multipart
```

This is because uploaded files are sent as "form data".

///

## Import `File`

Import `File` and `UploadFile` from `fastapi`:

{* ../../docs_src/request_files/tutorial001_an_py39.py hl[3] *}

## Define `File` Parameters

Create file parameters the same way you would for `Body` or `Form`:

{* ../../docs_src/request_files/tutorial001_an_py39.py hl[9] *}

/// info

`File` is a class that inherits directly from `Form`.

But remember that when you import `Query`, `Path`, `File` and others from `fastapi`, those are actually functions that return special classes.

///

/// tip

To declare File bodies, you need to use `File`, because otherwise the parameters would be interpreted as query parameters or body (JSON) parameters.

///

The files will be uploaded as "form data".

If you declare the type of your *path operation function* parameter as `bytes`, **FastAPI** will read the file for you and you will receive the contents as `bytes`.

Keep in mind that this means that the whole contents will be stored in memory. This will work well for small files.

But there are several cases in which you might benefit from using `UploadFile`.

## File Parameters with `UploadFile`

Define a file parameter with a type of `UploadFile`:

{* ../../docs_src/request_files/tutorial001_an_py39.py hl[14] *}

Using `UploadFile` has several advantages over `bytes`:

* You don't have to use `File()` in the default value of the parameter.
* It uses a "spooled" file:
    * A file stored in memory up to a maximum size limit, and after passing this limit it will be stored in disk.
* This means that it will work well for large files like images, videos, large binaries, etc. without consuming all the memory.
* You can get metadata from the uploaded file.
* It has a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-like-object" class="external-link" target="_blank">file-like</a> `async` interface.
* It exposes an actual Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile" class="external-link" target="_blank">`SpooledTemporaryFile`</a> object that you can pass directly to other libraries that expect a file-like object.

### `UploadFile`

`UploadFile` has the following attributes:

* `filename`: A `str` with the original file name that was uploaded (e.g. `myimage.jpg`).
* `content_type`: A `str` with the content type (MIME type / media type) (e.g. `image/jpeg`).
* `file`: A <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile" class="external-link" target="_blank">`SpooledTemporaryFile`</a> (a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-like-object" class="external-link" target="_blank">file-like</a> object). This is the actual Python file object that you can pass directly to other functions or libraries that expect a "file-like" object.

`UploadFile` has the following `async` methods. They all call the corresponding file methods underneath (using the internal `SpooledTemporaryFile`).

* `write(data)`: Writes `data` (`str` or `bytes`) to the file.
* `read(size)`: Reads `size` (`int`) bytes/characters of the file.
* `seek(offset)`: Goes to the byte position `offset` (`int`) in the file.
    * E.g., `await myfile.seek(0)` would go to the start of the file.
    * This is especially useful if you run `await myfile.read()` once and then need to read the contents again.
* `close()`: Closes the file.

As all these methods are `async` methods, you need to "await" them.

For example, inside of an `async` *path operation function* you can get the contents with:

```Python
contents = await myfile.read()
```

If you are inside of a normal `def` *path operation function*, you can access the `UploadFile.file` directly, for example:

```Python
contents = myfile.file.read()
```

/// note | `async` Technical Details

When you use the `async` methods, **FastAPI** runs the file methods in a threadpool and awaits for them.

///

/// note | Starlette Technical Details

**FastAPI**'s `UploadFile` inherits directly from **Starlette**'s `UploadFile`, but adds some necessary parts to make it compatible with **Pydantic** and the other parts of FastAPI.

///

## What is "Form Data"

The way HTML forms (`<form></form>`) sends the data to the server normally uses a "special" encoding for that data, it's different from JSON.

**FastAPI** will make sure to read that data from the right place instead of JSON.

/// note | Technical Details

Data from forms is normally encoded using the "media type" `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` when it doesn't include files.

But when the form includes files, it is encoded as `multipart/form-data`. If you use `File`, **FastAPI** will know it has to get the files from the correct part of the body.

If you want to read more about these encodings and form fields, head to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST" class="external-link" target="_blank"><abbr title="Mozilla Developer Network">MDN</abbr> web docs for <code>POST</code></a>.

///

/// warning

You can declare multiple `File` and `Form` parameters in a *path operation*, but you can't also declare `Body` fields that you expect to receive as JSON, as the request will have the body encoded using `multipart/form-data` instead of `application/json`.

This is not a limitation of **FastAPI**, it's part of the HTTP protocol.

///

## Optional File Upload

You can make a file optional by using standard type annotations and setting a default value of `None`:

{* ../../docs_src/request_files/tutorial001_02_an_py310.py hl[9,17] *}

## `UploadFile` with Additional Metadata

You can also use `File()` with `UploadFile`, for example, to set additional metadata:

{* ../../docs_src/request_files/tutorial001_03_an_py39.py hl[9,15] *}

## Multiple File Uploads

It's possible to upload several files at the same time.

They would be associated to the same "form field" sent using "form data".

To use that, declare a list of `bytes` or `UploadFile`:

{* ../../docs_src/request_files/tutorial002_an_py39.py hl[10,15] *}

You will receive, as declared, a `list` of `bytes` or `UploadFile`s.

/// note | Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette.responses import HTMLResponse`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.responses` as `fastapi.responses` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available responses come directly from Starlette.

///

### Multiple File Uploads with Additional Metadata

And the same way as before, you can use `File()` to set additional parameters, even for `UploadFile`:

{* ../../docs_src/request_files/tutorial003_an_py39.py hl[11,18:20] *}

## Recap

Use `File`, `bytes`, and `UploadFile` to declare files to be uploaded in the request, sent as form data.

# Form Models

You can use **Pydantic models** to declare **form fields** in FastAPI.

/// info

To use forms, first install <a href="https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart" class="external-link" target="_blank">`python-multipart`</a>.

Make sure you create a [virtual environment](../virtual-environments.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, activate it, and then install it, for example:

```console
$ pip install python-multipart
```

///

/// note

This is supported since FastAPI version `0.113.0`. 🤓

///

## Pydantic Models for Forms

You just need to declare a **Pydantic model** with the fields you want to receive as **form fields**, and then declare the parameter as `Form`:

{* ../../docs_src/request_form_models/tutorial001_an_py39.py hl[9:11,15] *}

**FastAPI** will **extract** the data for **each field** from the **form data** in the request and give you the Pydantic model you defined.

## Check the Docs

You can verify it in the docs UI at `/docs`:

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="/img/tutorial/request-form-models/image01.png">
</div>

## Forbid Extra Form Fields

In some special use cases (probably not very common), you might want to **restrict** the form fields to only those declared in the Pydantic model. And **forbid** any **extra** fields.

/// note

This is supported since FastAPI version `0.114.0`. 🤓

///

You can use Pydantic's model configuration to `forbid` any `extra` fields:

{* ../../docs_src/request_form_models/tutorial002_an_py39.py hl[12] *}

If a client tries to send some extra data, they will receive an **error** response.

For example, if the client tries to send the form fields:

* `username`: `Rick`
* `password`: `Portal Gun`
* `extra`: `Mr. Poopybutthole`

They will receive an error response telling them that the field `extra` is not allowed:

```json
{
    "detail": [
        {
            "type": "extra_forbidden",
            "loc": ["body", "extra"],
            "msg": "Extra inputs are not permitted",
            "input": "Mr. Poopybutthole"
        }
    ]
}
```

For example, in one of the ways the OAuth2 specification can be used (called "password flow") it is required to send a `username` and `password` as form fields.

The <abbr title="specification">spec</abbr> requires the fields to be exactly named `username` and `password`, and to be sent as form fields, not JSON.

With `Form` you can declare the same configurations as with `Body` (and `Query`, `Path`, `Cookie`), including validation, examples, an alias (e.g. `user-name` instead of `username`), etc.

/// info

`Form` is a class that inherits directly from `Body`.

# Response Model - Return Type

You can declare the type used for the response by annotating the *path operation function* **return type**.

You can use **type annotations** the same way you would for input data in function **parameters**, you can use Pydantic models, lists, dictionaries, scalar values like integers, booleans, etc.

{* ../../docs_src/response_model/tutorial001_01_py310.py hl[16,21] *}

FastAPI will use this return type to:

* **Validate** the returned data.
    * If the data is invalid (e.g. you are missing a field), it means that *your* app code is broken, not returning what it should, and it will return a server error instead of returning incorrect data. This way you and your clients can be certain that they will receive the data and the data shape expected.
* Add a **JSON Schema** for the response, in the OpenAPI *path operation*.
    * This will be used by the **automatic docs**.
    * It will also be used by automatic client code generation tools.

But most importantly:

* It will **limit and filter** the output data to what is defined in the return type.
    * This is particularly important for **security**, we'll see more of that below.

## `response_model` Parameter

There are some cases where you need or want to return some data that is not exactly what the type declares.

For example, you could want to **return a dictionary** or a database object, but **declare it as a Pydantic model**. This way the Pydantic model would do all the data documentation, validation, etc. for the object that you returned (e.g. a dictionary or database object).

If you added the return type annotation, tools and editors would complain with a (correct) error telling you that your function is returning a type (e.g. a dict) that is different from what you declared (e.g. a Pydantic model).

In those cases, you can use the *path operation decorator* parameter `response_model` instead of the return type.

You can use the `response_model` parameter in any of the *path operations*:

* `@app.get()`
* `@app.post()`
* `@app.put()`
* `@app.delete()`
* etc.

{* ../../docs_src/response_model/tutorial001_py310.py hl[17,22,24:27] *}

/// note

Notice that `response_model` is a parameter of the "decorator" method (`get`, `post`, etc). Not of your *path operation function*, like all the parameters and body.

///

`response_model` receives the same type you would declare for a Pydantic model field, so, it can be a Pydantic model, but it can also be, e.g. a `list` of Pydantic models, like `List[Item]`.

FastAPI will use this `response_model` to do all the data documentation, validation, etc. and also to **convert and filter the output data** to its type declaration.

/// tip

If you have strict type checks in your editor, mypy, etc, you can declare the function return type as `Any`.

That way you tell the editor that you are intentionally returning anything. But FastAPI will still do the data documentation, validation, filtering, etc. with the `response_model`.

///

### `response_model` Priority

If you declare both a return type and a `response_model`, the `response_model` will take priority and be used by FastAPI.

This way you can add correct type annotations to your functions even when you are returning a type different than the response model, to be used by the editor and tools like mypy. And still you can have FastAPI do the data validation, documentation, etc. using the `response_model`.

You can also use `response_model=None` to disable creating a response model for that *path operation*, you might need to do it if you are adding type annotations for things that are not valid Pydantic fields, you will see an example of that in one of the sections below.

## Return the same input data

Here we are declaring a `UserIn` model, it will contain a plaintext password:

{* ../../docs_src/response_model/tutorial002_py310.py hl[7,9] *}

/// info

To use `EmailStr`, first install <a href="https://github.com/JoshData/python-email-validator" class="external-link" target="_blank">`email-validator`</a>.

Make sure you create a [virtual environment](../virtual-environments.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, activate it, and then install it, for example:

```console
$ pip install email-validator
```

or with:

```console
$ pip install "pydantic[email]"
```

///

And we are using this model to declare our input and the same model to declare our output:

{* ../../docs_src/response_model/tutorial002_py310.py hl[16] *}

Now, whenever a browser is creating a user with a password, the API will return the same password in the response.

In this case, it might not be a problem, because it's the same user sending the password.

But if we use the same model for another *path operation*, we could be sending our user's passwords to every client.

/// danger

Never store the plain password of a user or send it in a response like this, unless you know all the caveats and you know what you are doing.

///

## Add an output model

We can instead create an input model with the plaintext password and an output model without it:

{* ../../docs_src/response_model/tutorial003_py310.py hl[9,11,16] *}

Here, even though our *path operation function* is returning the same input user that contains the password:

{* ../../docs_src/response_model/tutorial003_py310.py hl[24] *}

...we declared the `response_model` to be our model `UserOut`, that doesn't include the password:

{* ../../docs_src/response_model/tutorial003_py310.py hl[22] *}

So, **FastAPI** will take care of filtering out all the data that is not declared in the output model (using Pydantic).

### `response_model` or Return Type

In this case, because the two models are different, if we annotated the function return type as `UserOut`, the editor and tools would complain that we are returning an invalid type, as those are different classes.

That's why in this example we have to declare it in the `response_model` parameter.

...but continue reading below to see how to overcome that.

## Return Type and Data Filtering

Let's continue from the previous example. We wanted to **annotate the function with one type**, but we wanted to be able to return from the function something that actually includes **more data**.

We want FastAPI to keep **filtering** the data using the response model. So that even though the function returns more data, the response will only include the fields declared in the response model.

In the previous example, because the classes were different, we had to use the `response_model` parameter. But that also means that we don't get the support from the editor and tools checking the function return type.

But in most of the cases where we need to do something like this, we want the model just to **filter/remove** some of the data as in this example.

And in those cases, we can use classes and inheritance to take advantage of function **type annotations** to get better support in the editor and tools, and still get the FastAPI **data filtering**.

{* ../../docs_src/response_model/tutorial003_01_py310.py hl[7:10,13:14,18] *}

With this, we get tooling support, from editors and mypy as this code is correct in terms of types, but we also get the data filtering from FastAPI.

How does this work? Let's check that out. 🤓

### Type Annotations and Tooling

First let's see how editors, mypy and other tools would see this.

`BaseUser` has the base fields. Then `UserIn` inherits from `BaseUser` and adds the `password` field, so, it will include all the fields from both models.

We annotate the function return type as `BaseUser`, but we are actually returning a `UserIn` instance.

The editor, mypy, and other tools won't complain about this because, in typing terms, `UserIn` is a subclass of `BaseUser`, which means it's a *valid* type when what is expected is anything that is a `BaseUser`.

### FastAPI Data Filtering

Now, for FastAPI, it will see the return type and make sure that what you return includes **only** the fields that are declared in the type.

FastAPI does several things internally with Pydantic to make sure that those same rules of class inheritance are not used for the returned data filtering, otherwise you could end up returning much more data than what you expected.

This way, you can get the best of both worlds: type annotations with **tooling support** and **data filtering**.

## See it in the docs

When you see the automatic docs, you can check that the input model and output model will both have their own JSON Schema:

<img src="/img/tutorial/response-model/image01.png">

And both models will be used for the interactive API documentation:

<img src="/img/tutorial/response-model/image02.png">

## Other Return Type Annotations

There might be cases where you return something that is not a valid Pydantic field and you annotate it in the function, only to get the support provided by tooling (the editor, mypy, etc).

### Return a Response Directly

The most common case would be [returning a Response directly as explained later in the advanced docs](../advanced/response-directly.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

{* ../../docs_src/response_model/tutorial003_02.py hl[8,10:11] *}

This simple case is handled automatically by FastAPI because the return type annotation is the class (or a subclass of) `Response`.

And tools will also be happy because both `RedirectResponse` and `JSONResponse` are subclasses of `Response`, so the type annotation is correct.

### Annotate a Response Subclass

You can also use a subclass of `Response` in the type annotation:

{* ../../docs_src/response_model/tutorial003_03.py hl[8:9] *}

This will also work because `RedirectResponse` is a subclass of `Response`, and FastAPI will automatically handle this simple case.

### Invalid Return Type Annotations

But when you return some other arbitrary object that is not a valid Pydantic type (e.g. a database object) and you annotate it like that in the function, FastAPI will try to create a Pydantic response model from that type annotation, and will fail.

The same would happen if you had something like a <abbr title='A union between multiple types means "any of these types".'>union</abbr> between different types where one or more of them are not valid Pydantic types, for example this would fail 💥:

{* ../../docs_src/response_model/tutorial003_04_py310.py hl[8] *}

...this fails because the type annotation is not a Pydantic type and is not just a single `Response` class or subclass, it's a union (any of the two) between a `Response` and a `dict`.

### Disable Response Model

Continuing from the example above, you might not want to have the default data validation, documentation, filtering, etc. that is performed by FastAPI.

But you might want to still keep the return type annotation in the function to get the support from tools like editors and type checkers (e.g. mypy).

In this case, you can disable the response model generation by setting `response_model=None`:

{* ../../docs_src/response_model/tutorial003_05_py310.py hl[7] *}

This will make FastAPI skip the response model generation and that way you can have any return type annotations you need without it affecting your FastAPI application. 🤓

## Response Model encoding parameters

Your response model could have default values, like:

{* ../../docs_src/response_model/tutorial004_py310.py hl[9,11:12] *}

* `description: Union[str, None] = None` (or `str | None = None` in Python 3.10) has a default of `None`.
* `tax: float = 10.5` has a default of `10.5`.
* `tags: List[str] = []` has a default of an empty list: `[]`.

but you might want to omit them from the result if they were not actually stored.

For example, if you have models with many optional attributes in a NoSQL database, but you don't want to send very long JSON responses full of default values.

### Use the `response_model_exclude_unset` parameter

You can set the *path operation decorator* parameter `response_model_exclude_unset=True`:

{* ../../docs_src/response_model/tutorial004_py310.py hl[22] *}

and those default values won't be included in the response, only the values actually set.

So, if you send a request to that *path operation* for the item with ID `foo`, the response (not including default values) will be:

```JSON
{
    "name": "Foo",
    "price": 50.2
}
```

/// info

In Pydantic v1 the method was called `.dict()`, it was deprecated (but still supported) in Pydantic v2, and renamed to `.model_dump()`.

The examples here use `.dict()` for compatibility with Pydantic v1, but you should use `.model_dump()` instead if you can use Pydantic v2.

///

/// info

FastAPI uses Pydantic model's `.dict()` with <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/1.10/usage/exporting_models/#modeldict" class="external-link" target="_blank">its `exclude_unset` parameter</a> to achieve this.

///

/// info

You can also use:

* `response_model_exclude_defaults=True`
* `response_model_exclude_none=True`

as described in <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/1.10/usage/exporting_models/#modeldict" class="external-link" target="_blank">the Pydantic docs</a> for `exclude_defaults` and `exclude_none`.

///

#### Data with values for fields with defaults

But if your data has values for the model's fields with default values, like the item with ID `bar`:

```Python hl_lines="3  5"
{
    "name": "Bar",
    "description": "The bartenders",
    "price": 62,
    "tax": 20.2
}
```

they will be included in the response.

#### Data with the same values as the defaults

If the data has the same values as the default ones, like the item with ID `baz`:

```Python hl_lines="3  5-6"
{
    "name": "Baz",
    "description": None,
    "price": 50.2,
    "tax": 10.5,
    "tags": []
}
```

FastAPI is smart enough (actually, Pydantic is smart enough) to realize that, even though `description`, `tax`, and `tags` have the same values as the defaults, they were set explicitly (instead of taken from the defaults).

So, they will be included in the JSON response.

/// tip

Notice that the default values can be anything, not only `None`.

They can be a list (`[]`), a `float` of `10.5`, etc.

///

### `response_model_include` and `response_model_exclude`

You can also use the *path operation decorator* parameters `response_model_include` and `response_model_exclude`.

They take a `set` of `str` with the name of the attributes to include (omitting the rest) or to exclude (including the rest).

This can be used as a quick shortcut if you have only one Pydantic model and want to remove some data from the output.

/// tip

But it is still recommended to use the ideas above, using multiple classes, instead of these parameters.

This is because the JSON Schema generated in your app's OpenAPI (and the docs) will still be the one for the complete model, even if you use `response_model_include` or `response_model_exclude` to omit some attributes.

This also applies to `response_model_by_alias` that works similarly.

///

{* ../../docs_src/response_model/tutorial005_py310.py hl[29,35] *}

/// tip

The syntax `{"name", "description"}` creates a `set` with those two values.

It is equivalent to `set(["name", "description"])`.

///

#### Using `list`s instead of `set`s

If you forget to use a `set` and use a `list` or `tuple` instead, FastAPI will still convert it to a `set` and it will work correctly:

{* ../../docs_src/response_model/tutorial006_py310.py hl[29,35] *}

## Recap

Use the *path operation decorator's* parameter `response_model` to define response models and especially to ensure private data is filtered out.

Use `response_model_exclude_unset` to return only the values explicitly set.

## File: docs/en/docs/tutorial/response-status-code.md
````markdown
# Response Status Code

The same way you can specify a response model, you can also declare the HTTP status code used for the response with the parameter `status_code` in any of the *path operations*:

* `@app.get()`
* `@app.post()`
* `@app.put()`
* `@app.delete()`
* etc.

{* ../../docs_src/response_status_code/tutorial001.py hl[6] *}

/// note

Notice that `status_code` is a parameter of the "decorator" method (`get`, `post`, etc). Not of your *path operation function*, like all the parameters and body.

///

The `status_code` parameter receives a number with the HTTP status code.

/// info

`status_code` can alternatively also receive an `IntEnum`, such as Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.html#http.HTTPStatus" class="external-link" target="_blank">`http.HTTPStatus`</a>.

///

It will:

* Return that status code in the response.
* Document it as such in the OpenAPI schema (and so, in the user interfaces):

<img src="/img/tutorial/response-status-code/image01.png">

/// note

Some response codes (see the next section) indicate that the response does not have a body.

FastAPI knows this, and will produce OpenAPI docs that state there is no response body.

///

## About HTTP status codes

/// note

If you already know what HTTP status codes are, skip to the next section.

///

In HTTP, you send a numeric status code of 3 digits as part of the response.

These status codes have a name associated to recognize them, but the important part is the number.

In short:

* `100 - 199` are for "Information". You rarely use them directly.  Responses with these status codes cannot have a body.
* **`200 - 299`** are for "Successful" responses. These are the ones you would use the most.
    * `200` is the default status code, which means everything was "OK".
    * Another example would be `201`, "Created". It is commonly used after creating a new record in the database.
    * A special case is `204`, "No Content".  This response is used when there is no content to return to the client, and so the response must not have a body.
* **`300 - 399`** are for "Redirection".  Responses with these status codes may or may not have a body, except for `304`, "Not Modified", which must not have one.
* **`400 - 499`** are for "Client error" responses. These are the second type you would probably use the most.
    * An example is `404`, for a "Not Found" response.
    * For generic errors from the client, you can just use `400`.
* `500 - 599` are for server errors. You almost never use them directly. When something goes wrong at some part in your application code, or server, it will automatically return one of these status codes.

/// tip

To know more about each status code and which code is for what, check the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status" class="external-link" target="_blank"><abbr title="Mozilla Developer Network">MDN</abbr> documentation about HTTP status codes</a>.

///

## Shortcut to remember the names

Let's see the previous example again:

{* ../../docs_src/response_status_code/tutorial001.py hl[6] *}

`201` is the status code for "Created".

But you don't have to memorize what each of these codes mean.

You can use the convenience variables from `fastapi.status`.

{* ../../docs_src/response_status_code/tutorial002.py hl[1,6] *}

They are just a convenience, they hold the same number, but that way you can use the editor's autocomplete to find them:

<img src="/img/tutorial/response-status-code/image02.png">

/// note | Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette import status`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.status` as `fastapi.status` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But it comes directly from Starlette.

///

## Changing the default

Later, in the [Advanced User Guide](../advanced/response-change-status-code.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, you will see how to return a different status code than the default you are declaring here.
````

## File: docs/en/docs/tutorial/schema-extra-example.md
````markdown
# Declare Request Example Data

You can declare examples of the data your app can receive.

Here are several ways to do it.

## Extra JSON Schema data in Pydantic models

You can declare `examples` for a Pydantic model that will be added to the generated JSON Schema.

//// tab | Pydantic v2

{* ../../docs_src/schema_extra_example/tutorial001_py310.py hl[13:24] *}

////

//// tab | Pydantic v1

{* ../../docs_src/schema_extra_example/tutorial001_pv1_py310.py hl[13:23] *}

////

That extra info will be added as-is to the output **JSON Schema** for that model, and it will be used in the API docs.

//// tab | Pydantic v2

In Pydantic version 2, you would use the attribute `model_config`, that takes a `dict` as described in <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/config/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic's docs: Configuration</a>.

You can set `"json_schema_extra"` with a `dict` containing any additional data you would like to show up in the generated JSON Schema, including `examples`.

////

//// tab | Pydantic v1

In Pydantic version 1, you would use an internal class `Config` and `schema_extra`, as described in <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/1.10/usage/schema/#schema-customization" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic's docs: Schema customization</a>.

You can set `schema_extra` with a `dict` containing any additional data you would like to show up in the generated JSON Schema, including `examples`.

////

/// tip

You could use the same technique to extend the JSON Schema and add your own custom extra info.

For example you could use it to add metadata for a frontend user interface, etc.

///

/// info

OpenAPI 3.1.0 (used since FastAPI 0.99.0) added support for `examples`, which is part of the **JSON Schema** standard.

Before that, it only supported the keyword `example` with a single example. That is still supported by OpenAPI 3.1.0, but is deprecated and is not part of the JSON Schema standard. So you are encouraged to migrate `example` to `examples`. 🤓

You can read more at the end of this page.

///

## `Field` additional arguments

When using `Field()` with Pydantic models, you can also declare additional `examples`:

{* ../../docs_src/schema_extra_example/tutorial002_py310.py hl[2,8:11] *}

## `examples` in JSON Schema - OpenAPI

When using any of:

* `Path()`
* `Query()`
* `Header()`
* `Cookie()`
* `Body()`
* `Form()`
* `File()`

you can also declare a group of `examples` with additional information that will be added to their **JSON Schemas** inside of **OpenAPI**.

### `Body` with `examples`

Here we pass `examples` containing one example of the data expected in `Body()`:

{* ../../docs_src/schema_extra_example/tutorial003_an_py310.py hl[22:29] *}

### Example in the docs UI

With any of the methods above it would look like this in the `/docs`:

<img src="/img/tutorial/body-fields/image01.png">

### `Body` with multiple `examples`

You can of course also pass multiple `examples`:

{* ../../docs_src/schema_extra_example/tutorial004_an_py310.py hl[23:38] *}

When you do this, the examples will be part of the internal **JSON Schema** for that body data.

Nevertheless, at the <abbr title="2023-08-26">time of writing this</abbr>, Swagger UI, the tool in charge of showing the docs UI, doesn't support showing multiple examples for the data in **JSON Schema**. But read below for a workaround.

### OpenAPI-specific `examples`

Since before **JSON Schema** supported `examples` OpenAPI had support for a different field also called `examples`.

This **OpenAPI-specific** `examples` goes in another section in the OpenAPI specification. It goes in the **details for each *path operation***, not inside each JSON Schema.

And Swagger UI has supported this particular `examples` field for a while. So, you can use it to **show** different **examples in the docs UI**.

The shape of this OpenAPI-specific field `examples` is a `dict` with **multiple examples** (instead of a `list`), each with extra information that will be added to **OpenAPI** too.

This doesn't go inside of each JSON Schema contained in OpenAPI, this goes outside, in the *path operation* directly.

### Using the `openapi_examples` Parameter

You can declare the OpenAPI-specific `examples` in FastAPI with the parameter `openapi_examples` for:

* `Path()`
* `Query()`
* `Header()`
* `Cookie()`
* `Body()`
* `Form()`
* `File()`

The keys of the `dict` identify each example, and each value is another `dict`.

Each specific example `dict` in the `examples` can contain:

* `summary`: Short description for the example.
* `description`: A long description that can contain Markdown text.
* `value`: This is the actual example shown, e.g. a `dict`.
* `externalValue`: alternative to `value`, a URL pointing to the example. Although this might not be supported by as many tools as `value`.

You can use it like this:

{* ../../docs_src/schema_extra_example/tutorial005_an_py310.py hl[23:49] *}

### OpenAPI Examples in the Docs UI

With `openapi_examples` added to `Body()` the `/docs` would look like:

<img src="/img/tutorial/body-fields/image02.png">

## Technical Details

/// tip

If you are already using **FastAPI** version **0.99.0 or above**, you can probably **skip** these details.

They are more relevant for older versions, before OpenAPI 3.1.0 was available.

You can consider this a brief OpenAPI and JSON Schema **history lesson**. 🤓

///

/// warning

These are very technical details about the standards **JSON Schema** and **OpenAPI**.

If the ideas above already work for you, that might be enough, and you probably don't need these details, feel free to skip them.

///

Before OpenAPI 3.1.0, OpenAPI used an older and modified version of **JSON Schema**.

JSON Schema didn't have `examples`, so OpenAPI added its own `example` field to its own modified version.

OpenAPI also added `example` and `examples` fields to other parts of the specification:

* <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#parameter-object" class="external-link" target="_blank">`Parameter Object` (in the specification)</a> that was used by FastAPI's:
    * `Path()`
    * `Query()`
    * `Header()`
    * `Cookie()`
* <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#media-type-object" class="external-link" target="_blank">`Request Body Object`, in the field `content`, on the `Media Type Object` (in the specification)</a> that was used by FastAPI's:
    * `Body()`
    * `File()`
    * `Form()`

/// info

This old OpenAPI-specific `examples` parameter is now `openapi_examples` since FastAPI `0.103.0`.

///

### JSON Schema's `examples` field

But then JSON Schema added an <a href="https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.9.5" class="external-link" target="_blank">`examples`</a> field to a new version of the specification.

And then the new OpenAPI 3.1.0 was based on the latest version (JSON Schema 2020-12) that included this new field `examples`.

And now this new `examples` field takes precedence over the old single (and custom) `example` field, that is now deprecated.

This new `examples` field in JSON Schema is **just a `list`** of examples, not a dict with extra metadata as in the other places in OpenAPI (described above).

/// info

Even after OpenAPI 3.1.0 was released with this new simpler integration with JSON Schema, for a while, Swagger UI, the tool that provides the automatic docs, didn't support OpenAPI 3.1.0 (it does since version 5.0.0 🎉).

Because of that, versions of FastAPI previous to 0.99.0 still used versions of OpenAPI lower than 3.1.0.

///

### Pydantic and FastAPI `examples`

When you add `examples` inside a Pydantic model, using `schema_extra` or `Field(examples=["something"])` that example is added to the **JSON Schema** for that Pydantic model.

And that **JSON Schema** of the Pydantic model is included in the **OpenAPI** of your API, and then it's used in the docs UI.

In versions of FastAPI before 0.99.0 (0.99.0 and above use the newer OpenAPI 3.1.0) when you used `example` or `examples` with any of the other utilities (`Query()`, `Body()`, etc.) those examples were not added to the JSON Schema that describes that data (not even to OpenAPI's own version of JSON Schema), they were added directly to the *path operation* declaration in OpenAPI (outside the parts of OpenAPI that use JSON Schema).

But now that FastAPI 0.99.0 and above uses OpenAPI 3.1.0, that uses JSON Schema 2020-12, and Swagger UI 5.0.0 and above, everything is more consistent and the examples are included in JSON Schema.

### Swagger UI and OpenAPI-specific `examples`

Now, as Swagger UI didn't support multiple JSON Schema examples (as of 2023-08-26), users didn't have a way to show multiple examples in the docs.

To solve that, FastAPI `0.103.0` **added support** for declaring the same old **OpenAPI-specific** `examples` field with the new parameter `openapi_examples`. 🤓

### Summary

I used to say I didn't like history that much... and look at me now giving "tech history" lessons. 😅

In short, **upgrade to FastAPI 0.99.0 or above**, and things are much **simpler, consistent, and intuitive**, and you don't have to know all these historic details. 😎

# SQL (Relational) Databases

**FastAPI** doesn't require you to use a SQL (relational) database. But you can use **any database** that you want.

Here we'll see an example using <a href="https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">SQLModel</a>.

**SQLModel** is built on top of <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">SQLAlchemy</a> and Pydantic. It was made by the same author of **FastAPI** to be the perfect match for FastAPI applications that need to use **SQL databases**.

/// tip

You could use any other SQL or NoSQL database library you want (in some cases called <abbr title="Object Relational Mapper, a fancy term for a library where some classes represent SQL tables and instances represent rows in those tables">"ORMs"</abbr>), FastAPI doesn't force you to use anything. 😎

///

As SQLModel is based on SQLAlchemy, you can easily use **any database supported** by SQLAlchemy (which makes them also supported by SQLModel), like:

* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* SQLite
* Oracle
* Microsoft SQL Server, etc.

In this example, we'll use **SQLite**, because it uses a single file and Python has integrated support. So, you can copy this example and run it as is.

Later, for your production application, you might want to use a database server like **PostgreSQL**.

/// tip

There is an official project generator with **FastAPI** and **PostgreSQL** including a frontend and more tools: <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template</a>

///

This is a very simple and short tutorial, if you want to learn about databases in general, about SQL, or more advanced features, go to the <a href="https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">SQLModel docs</a>.

## Install `SQLModel`

First, make sure you create your [virtual environment](../virtual-environments.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, activate it, and then install `sqlmodel`:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install sqlmodel
---> 100%
```

</div>

## Create the App with a Single Model

We'll create the simplest first version of the app with a single **SQLModel** model first.

Later we'll improve it increasing security and versatility with **multiple models** below. 🤓

### Create Models

Import `SQLModel` and create a database model:

{* ../../docs_src/sql_databases/tutorial001_an_py310.py ln[1:11] hl[7:11] *}

The `Hero` class is very similar to a Pydantic model (in fact, underneath, it actually *is a Pydantic model*).

There are a few differences:

* `table=True` tells SQLModel that this is a *table model*, it should represent a **table** in the SQL database, it's not just a *data model* (as would be any other regular Pydantic class).

* `Field(primary_key=True)` tells SQLModel that the `id` is the **primary key** in the SQL database (you can learn more about SQL primary keys in the SQLModel docs).

    By having the type as `int | None`, SQLModel will know that this column should be an `INTEGER` in the SQL database and that it should be `NULLABLE`.

* `Field(index=True)` tells SQLModel that it should create a **SQL index** for this column, that would allow faster lookups in the database when reading data filtered by this column.

    SQLModel will know that something declared as `str` will be a SQL column of type `TEXT` (or `VARCHAR`, depending on the database).

### Create an Engine

A SQLModel `engine` (underneath it's actually a SQLAlchemy `engine`) is what **holds the connections** to the database.

You would have **one single `engine` object** for all your code to connect to the same database.

{* ../../docs_src/sql_databases/tutorial001_an_py310.py ln[14:18] hl[14:15,17:18] *}

Using `check_same_thread=False` allows FastAPI to use the same SQLite database in different threads. This is necessary as **one single request** could use **more than one thread** (for example in dependencies).

Don't worry, with the way the code is structured, we'll make sure we use **a single SQLModel *session* per request** later, this is actually what the `check_same_thread` is trying to achieve.

### Create the Tables

We then add a function that uses `SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)` to **create the tables** for all the *table models*.

{* ../../docs_src/sql_databases/tutorial001_an_py310.py ln[21:22] hl[21:22] *}

### Create a Session Dependency

A **`Session`** is what stores the **objects in memory** and keeps track of any changes needed in the data, then it **uses the `engine`** to communicate with the database.

We will create a FastAPI **dependency** with `yield` that will provide a new `Session` for each request. This is what ensures that we use a single session per request. 🤓

Then we create an `Annotated` dependency `SessionDep` to simplify the rest of the code that will use this dependency.

{* ../../docs_src/sql_databases/tutorial001_an_py310.py ln[25:30]  hl[25:27,30] *}

### Create Database Tables on Startup

We will create the database tables when the application starts.

{* ../../docs_src/sql_databases/tutorial001_an_py310.py ln[32:37] hl[35:37] *}

Here we create the tables on an application startup event.

For production you would probably use a migration script that runs before you start your app. 🤓

/// tip

SQLModel will have migration utilities wrapping Alembic, but for now, you can use <a href="https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Alembic</a> directly.

///

### Create a Hero

Because each SQLModel model is also a Pydantic model, you can use it in the same **type annotations** that you could use Pydantic models.

For example, if you declare a parameter of type `Hero`, it will be read from the **JSON body**.

The same way, you can declare it as the function's **return type**, and then the shape of the data will show up in the automatic API docs UI.

{* ../../docs_src/sql_databases/tutorial001_an_py310.py ln[40:45] hl[40:45] *}

Here we use the `SessionDep` dependency (a `Session`) to add the new `Hero` to the `Session` instance, commit the changes to the database, refresh the data in the `hero`, and then return it.

### Read Heroes

We can **read** `Hero`s from the database using a `select()`. We can include a `limit` and `offset` to paginate the results.

{* ../../docs_src/sql_databases/tutorial001_an_py310.py ln[48:55] hl[51:52,54] *}

### Read One Hero

We can **read** a single `Hero`.

{* ../../docs_src/sql_databases/tutorial001_an_py310.py ln[58:63] hl[60] *}

### Delete a Hero

We can also **delete** a `Hero`.

{* ../../docs_src/sql_databases/tutorial001_an_py310.py ln[66:73] hl[71] *}

### Run the App

You can run the app:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ fastapi dev main.py

<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

</div>

Then go to the `/docs` UI, you will see that **FastAPI** is using these **models** to **document** the API, and it will use them to **serialize** and **validate** the data too.

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="/img/tutorial/sql-databases/image01.png">
</div>

## Update the App with Multiple Models

Now let's **refactor** this app a bit to increase **security** and **versatility**.

If you check the previous app, in the UI you can see that, up to now, it lets the client decide the `id` of the `Hero` to create. 😱

We shouldn't let that happen, they could overwrite an `id` we already have assigned in the DB. Deciding the `id` should be done by the **backend** or the **database**, **not by the client**.

Additionally, we create a `secret_name` for the hero, but so far, we are returning it everywhere, that's not very **secret**... 😅

We'll fix these things by adding a few **extra models**. Here's where SQLModel will shine. ✨

### Create Multiple Models

In **SQLModel**, any model class that has `table=True` is a **table model**.

And any model class that doesn't have `table=True` is a **data model**, these ones are actually just Pydantic models (with a couple of small extra features). 🤓

With SQLModel, we can use **inheritance** to **avoid duplicating** all the fields in all the cases.

#### `HeroBase` - the base class

Let's start with a `HeroBase` model that has all the **fields that are shared** by all the models:

* `name`
* `age`

{* ../../docs_src/sql_databases/tutorial002_an_py310.py ln[7:9] hl[7:9] *}

#### `Hero` - the *table model*

Then let's create `Hero`, the actual *table model*, with the **extra fields** that are not always in the other models:

* `id`
* `secret_name`

Because `Hero` inherits form `HeroBase`, it **also** has the **fields** declared in `HeroBase`, so all the fields for `Hero` are:

* `id`
* `name`
* `age`
* `secret_name`

{* ../../docs_src/sql_databases/tutorial002_an_py310.py ln[7:14] hl[12:14] *}

#### `HeroPublic` - the public *data model*

Next, we create a `HeroPublic` model, this is the one that will be **returned** to the clients of the API.

It has the same fields as `HeroBase`, so it won't include `secret_name`.

Finally, the identity of our heroes is protected! 🥷

It also re-declares `id: int`. By doing this, we are making a **contract** with the API clients, so that they can always expect the `id` to be there and to be an `int` (it will never be `None`).

/// tip

Having the return model ensure that a value is always available and always `int` (not `None`) is very useful for the API clients, they can write much simpler code having this certainty.

Also, **automatically generated clients** will have simpler interfaces, so that the developers communicating with your API can have a much better time working with your API. 😎

///

All the fields in `HeroPublic` are the same as in `HeroBase`, with `id` declared as `int` (not `None`):

* `id`
* `name`
* `age`

{* ../../docs_src/sql_databases/tutorial002_an_py310.py ln[7:18] hl[17:18] *}

#### `HeroCreate` - the *data model* to create a hero

Now we create a `HeroCreate` model, this is the one that will **validate** the data from the clients.

It has the same fields as `HeroBase`, and it also has `secret_name`.

Now, when the clients **create a new hero**, they will send the `secret_name`, it will be stored in the database, but those secret names won't be returned in the API to the clients.

/// tip

This is how you would handle **passwords**. Receive them, but don't return them in the API.

You would also **hash** the values of the passwords before storing them, **never store them in plain text**.

///

The fields of `HeroCreate` are:

* `name`
* `age`
* `secret_name`

{* ../../docs_src/sql_databases/tutorial002_an_py310.py ln[7:22] hl[21:22] *}

#### `HeroUpdate` - the *data model* to update a hero

We didn't have a way to **update a hero** in the previous version of the app, but now with **multiple models**, we can do it. 🎉

The `HeroUpdate` *data model* is somewhat special, it has **all the same fields** that would be needed to create a new hero, but all the fields are **optional** (they all have a default value). This way, when you update a hero, you can send just the fields that you want to update.

Because all the **fields actually change** (the type now includes `None` and they now have a default value of `None`), we need to **re-declare** them.

We don't really need to inherit from `HeroBase` because we are re-declaring all the fields. I'll leave it inheriting just for consistency, but this is not necessary. It's more a matter of personal taste. 🤷

The fields of `HeroUpdate` are:

* `name`
* `age`
* `secret_name`

{* ../../docs_src/sql_databases/tutorial002_an_py310.py ln[7:28] hl[25:28] *}

### Create with `HeroCreate` and return a `HeroPublic`

Now that we have **multiple models**, we can update the parts of the app that use them.

We receive in the request a `HeroCreate` *data model*, and from it, we create a `Hero` *table model*.

This new *table model* `Hero` will have the fields sent by the client, and will also have an `id` generated by the database.

Then we return the same *table model* `Hero` as is from the function. But as we declare the `response_model` with the `HeroPublic` *data model*, **FastAPI** will use `HeroPublic` to validate and serialize the data.

{* ../../docs_src/sql_databases/tutorial002_an_py310.py ln[56:62] hl[56:58] *}

/// tip

Now we use `response_model=HeroPublic` instead of the **return type annotation** `-> HeroPublic` because the value that we are returning is actually *not* a `HeroPublic`.

If we had declared `-> HeroPublic`, your editor and linter would complain (rightfully so) that you are returning a `Hero` instead of a `HeroPublic`.

By declaring it in `response_model` we are telling **FastAPI** to do its thing, without interfering with the type annotations and the help from your editor and other tools.

///

### Read Heroes with `HeroPublic`

We can do the same as before to **read** `Hero`s, again, we use `response_model=list[HeroPublic]` to ensure that the data is validated and serialized correctly.

{* ../../docs_src/sql_databases/tutorial002_an_py310.py ln[65:72] hl[65] *}

### Read One Hero with `HeroPublic`

We can **read** a single hero:

{* ../../docs_src/sql_databases/tutorial002_an_py310.py ln[75:80] hl[77] *}

### Update a Hero with `HeroUpdate`

We can **update a hero**. For this we use an HTTP `PATCH` operation.

And in the code, we get a `dict` with all the data sent by the client, **only the data sent by the client**, excluding any values that would be there just for being the default values. To do it we use `exclude_unset=True`. This is the main trick. 🪄

Then we use `hero_db.sqlmodel_update(hero_data)` to update the `hero_db` with the data from `hero_data`.

{* ../../docs_src/sql_databases/tutorial002_an_py310.py ln[83:93] hl[83:84,88:89] *}

### Delete a Hero Again

**Deleting** a hero stays pretty much the same.

We won't satisfy the desire to refactor everything in this one. 😅

{* ../../docs_src/sql_databases/tutorial002_an_py310.py ln[96:103] hl[101] *}

### Run the App Again

You can run the app again:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ fastapi dev main.py

<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

</div>

If you go to the `/docs` API UI, you will see that it is now updated, and it won't expect to receive the `id` from the client when creating a hero, etc.

# Static Files

You can serve static files automatically from a directory using `StaticFiles`.

## Use `StaticFiles`

* Import `StaticFiles`.
* "Mount" a `StaticFiles()` instance in a specific path.

{* ../../docs_src/static_files/tutorial001.py hl[2,6] *}

/// note | Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette.staticfiles import StaticFiles`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.staticfiles` as `fastapi.staticfiles` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But it actually comes directly from Starlette.

///

### What is "Mounting"

"Mounting" means adding a complete "independent" application in a specific path, that then takes care of handling all the sub-paths.

This is different from using an `APIRouter` as a mounted application is completely independent. The OpenAPI and docs from your main application won't include anything from the mounted application, etc.

You can read more about this in the [Advanced User Guide](../advanced/index.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

## Details

The first `"/static"` refers to the sub-path this "sub-application" will be "mounted" on. So, any path that starts with `"/static"` will be handled by it.

The `directory="static"` refers to the name of the directory that contains your static files.

The `name="static"` gives it a name that can be used internally by **FastAPI**.

All these parameters can be different than "`static`", adjust them with the needs and specific details of your own application.

## More info

For more details and options check <a href="https://www.starlette.io/staticfiles/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Starlette's docs about Static Files</a>.

# Testing

Thanks to <a href="https://www.starlette.io/testclient/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Starlette</a>, testing **FastAPI** applications is easy and enjoyable.

It is based on <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org" class="external-link" target="_blank">HTTPX</a>, which in turn is designed based on Requests, so it's very familiar and intuitive.

With it, you can use <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">pytest</a> directly with **FastAPI**.

## Using `TestClient`

/// info

To use `TestClient`, first install <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org" class="external-link" target="_blank">`httpx`</a>.

Make sure you create a [virtual environment](../virtual-environments.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, activate it, and then install it, for example:

```console
$ pip install httpx
```

///

Import `TestClient`.

Create a `TestClient` by passing your **FastAPI** application to it.

Create functions with a name that starts with `test_` (this is standard `pytest` conventions).

Use the `TestClient` object the same way as you do with `httpx`.

Write simple `assert` statements with the standard Python expressions that you need to check (again, standard `pytest`).

{* ../../docs_src/app_testing/tutorial001.py hl[2,12,15:18] *}

/// tip

Notice that the testing functions are normal `def`, not `async def`.

And the calls to the client are also normal calls, not using `await`.

This allows you to use `pytest` directly without complications.

///

/// note | Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette.testclient import TestClient`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.testclient` as `fastapi.testclient` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But it comes directly from Starlette.

///

/// tip

If you want to call `async` functions in your tests apart from sending requests to your FastAPI application (e.g. asynchronous database functions), have a look at the [Async Tests](../advanced/async-tests.md){.internal-link target=_blank} in the advanced tutorial.

///

## Separating tests

In a real application, you probably would have your tests in a different file.

And your **FastAPI** application might also be composed of several files/modules, etc.

### **FastAPI** app file

Let's say you have a file structure as described in [Bigger Applications](bigger-applications.md){.internal-link target=_blank}:

```
.
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── main.py
```

In the file `main.py` you have your **FastAPI** app:


{* ../../docs_src/app_testing/main.py *}

### Testing file

Then you could have a file `test_main.py` with your tests. It could live on the same Python package (the same directory with a `__init__.py` file):

``` hl_lines="5"
.
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   └── test_main.py
```

Because this file is in the same package, you can use relative imports to import the object `app` from the `main` module (`main.py`):

{* ../../docs_src/app_testing/test_main.py hl[3] *}


...and have the code for the tests just like before.

## Testing: extended example

Now let's extend this example and add more details to see how to test different parts.

### Extended **FastAPI** app file

Let's continue with the same file structure as before:

```
.
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   └── test_main.py
```

Let's say that now the file `main.py` with your **FastAPI** app has some other **path operations**.

It has a `GET` operation that could return an error.

It has a `POST` operation that could return several errors.

Both *path operations* require an `X-Token` header.

////

### Extended testing file

You could then update `test_main.py` with the extended tests:

{* ../../docs_src/app_testing/app_b/test_main.py *}


Whenever you need the client to pass information in the request and you don't know how to, you can search (Google) how to do it in `httpx`, or even how to do it with `requests`, as HTTPX's design is based on Requests' design.

Then you just do the same in your tests.

E.g.:

* To pass a *path* or *query* parameter, add it to the URL itself.
* To pass a JSON body, pass a Python object (e.g. a `dict`) to the parameter `json`.
* If you need to send *Form Data* instead of JSON, use the `data` parameter instead.
* To pass *headers*, use a `dict` in the `headers` parameter.
* For *cookies*, a `dict` in the `cookies` parameter.

For more information about how to pass data to the backend (using `httpx` or the `TestClient`) check the <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org" class="external-link" target="_blank">HTTPX documentation</a>.

/// info

Note that the `TestClient` receives data that can be converted to JSON, not Pydantic models.

If you have a Pydantic model in your test and you want to send its data to the application during testing, you can use the `jsonable_encoder` described in [JSON Compatible Encoder](encoder.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

///

## Run it

After that, you just need to install `pytest`.

Make sure you create a [virtual environment](../virtual-environments.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, activate it, and then install it, for example:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install pytest

---> 100%
```

</div>

It will detect the files and tests automatically, execute them, and report the results back to you.

Run the tests with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pytest

# Alternatives, Inspiration and Comparisons

What inspired **FastAPI**, how it compares to alternatives and what it learned from them.

## Intro

**FastAPI** wouldn't exist if not for the previous work of others.

There have been many tools created before that have helped inspire its creation.

I have been avoiding the creation of a new framework for several years. First I tried to solve all the features covered by **FastAPI** using many different frameworks, plug-ins, and tools.

But at some point, there was no other option than creating something that provided all these features, taking the best ideas from previous tools, and combining them in the best way possible, using language features that weren't even available before (Python 3.6+ type hints).

## Previous tools

### <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Django</a>

It's the most popular Python framework and is widely trusted. It is used to build systems like Instagram.

It's relatively tightly coupled with relational databases (like MySQL or PostgreSQL), so, having a NoSQL database (like Couchbase, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc) as the main store engine is not very easy.

It was created to generate the HTML in the backend, not to create APIs used by a modern frontend (like React, Vue.js and Angular) or by other systems (like <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> devices) communicating with it.

### <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Django REST Framework</a>

Django REST framework was created to be a flexible toolkit for building Web APIs using Django underneath, to improve its API capabilities.

It is used by many companies including Mozilla, Red Hat and Eventbrite.

It was one of the first examples of **automatic API documentation**, and this was specifically one of the first ideas that inspired "the search for" **FastAPI**.

/// note

Django REST Framework was created by Tom Christie. The same creator of Starlette and Uvicorn, on which **FastAPI** is based.

///

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Have an automatic API documentation web user interface.

///

### <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com" class="external-link" target="_blank">Flask</a>

Flask is a "microframework", it doesn't include database integrations nor many of the things that come by default in Django.

This simplicity and flexibility allow doing things like using NoSQL databases as the main data storage system.

As it is very simple, it's relatively intuitive to learn, although the documentation gets somewhat technical at some points.

It is also commonly used for other applications that don't necessarily need a database, user management, or any of the many features that come pre-built in Django. Although many of these features can be added with plug-ins.

This decoupling of parts, and being a "microframework" that could be extended to cover exactly what is needed was a key feature that I wanted to keep.

Given the simplicity of Flask, it seemed like a good match for building APIs. The next thing to find was a "Django REST Framework" for Flask.

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Be a micro-framework. Making it easy to mix and match the tools and parts needed.

Have a simple and easy to use routing system.

///

### <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io" class="external-link" target="_blank">Requests</a>

**FastAPI** is not actually an alternative to **Requests**. Their scope is very different.

It would actually be common to use Requests *inside* of a FastAPI application.

But still, FastAPI got quite some inspiration from Requests.

**Requests** is a library to *interact* with APIs (as a client), while **FastAPI** is a library to *build* APIs (as a server).

They are, more or less, at opposite ends, complementing each other.

Requests has a very simple and intuitive design, it's very easy to use, with sensible defaults. But at the same time, it's very powerful and customizable.

That's why, as said in the official website:

> Requests is one of the most downloaded Python packages of all time

The way you use it is very simple. For example, to do a `GET` request, you would write:

```Python
response = requests.get("http://example.com/some/url")
```

The FastAPI counterpart API *path operation* could look like:

```Python hl_lines="1"
@app.get("/some/url")
def read_url():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

### <a href="https://swagger.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Swagger</a> / <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/" class="external-link" target="_blank">OpenAPI</a>

The main feature I wanted from Django REST Framework was the automatic API documentation.

Then I found that there was a standard to document APIs, using JSON (or YAML, an extension of JSON) called Swagger.

And there was a web user interface for Swagger APIs already created. So, being able to generate Swagger documentation for an API would allow using this web user interface automatically.

At some point, Swagger was given to the Linux Foundation, to be renamed OpenAPI.

That's why when talking about version 2.0 it's common to say "Swagger", and for version 3+ "OpenAPI".

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Adopt and use an open standard for API specifications, instead of a custom schema.

And integrate standards-based user interface tools:

* <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc" class="external-link" target="_blank">ReDoc</a>

These two were chosen for being fairly popular and stable, but doing a quick search, you could find dozens of alternative user interfaces for OpenAPI (that you can use with **FastAPI**).

### Flask REST frameworks

There are several Flask REST frameworks, but after investing the time and work into investigating them, I found that many are discontinued or abandoned, with several standing issues that made them unfit.

### <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Marshmallow</a>

One of the main features needed by API systems is data "<abbr title="also called marshalling, conversion">serialization</abbr>" which is taking data from the code (Python) and converting it into something that can be sent through the network. For example, converting an object containing data from a database into a JSON object. Converting `datetime` objects into strings, etc.

Another big feature needed by APIs is data validation, making sure that the data is valid, given certain parameters. For example, that some field is an `int`, and not some random string. This is especially useful for incoming data.

Without a data validation system, you would have to do all the checks by hand, in code.

These features are what Marshmallow was built to provide. It is a great library, and I have used it a lot before.

But it was created before there existed Python type hints. So, to define every <abbr title="the definition of how data should be formed">schema</abbr> you need to use specific utils and classes provided by Marshmallow.

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Use code to define "schemas" that provide data types and validation, automatically.

///

### <a href="https://webargs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Webargs</a>

Another big feature required by APIs is <abbr title="reading and converting to Python data">parsing</abbr> data from incoming requests.

Webargs is a tool that was made to provide that on top of several frameworks, including Flask.

It uses Marshmallow underneath to do the data validation. And it was created by the same developers.

It's a great tool and I have used it a lot too, before having **FastAPI**.

/// info

Webargs was created by the same Marshmallow developers.

///

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Have automatic validation of incoming request data.

///

### <a href="https://apispec.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" class="external-link" target="_blank">APISpec</a>

Marshmallow and Webargs provide validation, parsing and serialization as plug-ins.

But documentation is still missing. Then APISpec was created.

It is a plug-in for many frameworks (and there's a plug-in for Starlette too).

The way it works is that you write the definition of the schema using YAML format inside the docstring of each function handling a route.

And it generates OpenAPI schemas.

That's how it works in Flask, Starlette, Responder, etc.

But then, we have again the problem of having a micro-syntax, inside of a Python string (a big YAML).

The editor can't help much with that. And if we modify parameters or Marshmallow schemas and forget to also modify that YAML docstring, the generated schema would be obsolete.

/// info

APISpec was created by the same Marshmallow developers.

///

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Support the open standard for APIs, OpenAPI.

///

### <a href="https://flask-apispec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Flask-apispec</a>

It's a Flask plug-in, that ties together Webargs, Marshmallow and APISpec.

It uses the information from Webargs and Marshmallow to automatically generate OpenAPI schemas, using APISpec.

It's a great tool, very underrated. It should be way more popular than many Flask plug-ins out there. It might be due to its documentation being too concise and abstract.

This solved having to write YAML (another syntax) inside of Python docstrings.

This combination of Flask, Flask-apispec with Marshmallow and Webargs was my favorite backend stack until building **FastAPI**.

Using it led to the creation of several Flask full-stack generators. These are the main stacks I (and several external teams) have been using up to now:

* <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-flask-couchbase" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-flask-couchbase</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-flask-couchdb" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-flask-couchdb</a>

And these same full-stack generators were the base of the [**FastAPI** Project Generators](project-generation.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

/// info

Flask-apispec was created by the same Marshmallow developers.

///

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Generate the OpenAPI schema automatically, from the same code that defines serialization and validation.

///

### <a href="https://nestjs.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">NestJS</a> (and <a href="https://angular.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Angular</a>)

This isn't even Python, NestJS is a JavaScript (TypeScript) NodeJS framework inspired by Angular.

It achieves something somewhat similar to what can be done with Flask-apispec.

It has an integrated dependency injection system, inspired by Angular 2. It requires pre-registering the "injectables" (like all the other dependency injection systems I know), so, it adds to the verbosity and code repetition.

As the parameters are described with TypeScript types (similar to Python type hints), editor support is quite good.

But as TypeScript data is not preserved after compilation to JavaScript, it cannot rely on the types to define validation, serialization and documentation at the same time. Due to this and some design decisions, to get validation, serialization and automatic schema generation, it's needed to add decorators in many places. So, it becomes quite verbose.

It can't handle nested models very well. So, if the JSON body in the request is a JSON object that has inner fields that in turn are nested JSON objects, it cannot be properly documented and validated.

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Use Python types to have great editor support.

Have a powerful dependency injection system. Find a way to minimize code repetition.

///

### <a href="https://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Sanic</a>

It was one of the first extremely fast Python frameworks based on `asyncio`. It was made to be very similar to Flask.

/// note | Technical Details

It used <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop" class="external-link" target="_blank">`uvloop`</a> instead of the default Python `asyncio` loop. That's what made it so fast.

It clearly inspired Uvicorn and Starlette, that are currently faster than Sanic in open benchmarks.

///

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Find a way to have a crazy performance.

That's why **FastAPI** is based on Starlette, as it is the fastest framework available (tested by third-party benchmarks).

///

### <a href="https://falconframework.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Falcon</a>

Falcon is another high performance Python framework, it is designed to be minimal, and work as the foundation of other frameworks like Hug.

It is designed to have functions that receive two parameters, one "request" and one "response". Then you "read" parts from the request, and "write" parts to the response. Because of this design, it is not possible to declare request parameters and bodies with standard Python type hints as function parameters.

So, data validation, serialization, and documentation, have to be done in code, not automatically. Or they have to be implemented as a framework on top of Falcon, like Hug. This same distinction happens in other frameworks that are inspired by Falcon's design, of having one request object and one response object as parameters.

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Find ways to get great performance.

Along with Hug (as Hug is based on Falcon) inspired **FastAPI** to declare a `response` parameter in functions.

Although in FastAPI it's optional, and is used mainly to set headers, cookies, and alternative status codes.

///

### <a href="https://moltenframework.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Molten</a>

I discovered Molten in the first stages of building **FastAPI**. And it has quite similar ideas:

* Based on Python type hints.
* Validation and documentation from these types.
* Dependency Injection system.

It doesn't use a data validation, serialization and documentation third-party library like Pydantic, it has its own. So, these data type definitions would not be reusable as easily.

It requires a little bit more verbose configurations. And as it is based on WSGI (instead of ASGI), it is not designed to take advantage of the high performance provided by tools like Uvicorn, Starlette and Sanic.

The dependency injection system requires pre-registration of the dependencies and the dependencies are solved based on the declared types. So, it's not possible to declare more than one "component" that provides a certain type.

Routes are declared in a single place, using functions declared in other places (instead of using decorators that can be placed right on top of the function that handles the endpoint). This is closer to how Django does it than to how Flask (and Starlette) does it. It separates in the code things that are relatively tightly coupled.

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Define extra validations for data types using the "default" value of model attributes. This improves editor support, and it was not available in Pydantic before.

This actually inspired updating parts of Pydantic, to support the same validation declaration style (all this functionality is now already available in Pydantic).

///

### <a href="https://github.com/hugapi/hug" class="external-link" target="_blank">Hug</a>

Hug was one of the first frameworks to implement the declaration of API parameter types using Python type hints. This was a great idea that inspired other tools to do the same.

It used custom types in its declarations instead of standard Python types, but it was still a huge step forward.

It also was one of the first frameworks to generate a custom schema declaring the whole API in JSON.

It was not based on a standard like OpenAPI and JSON Schema. So it wouldn't be straightforward to integrate it with other tools, like Swagger UI. But again, it was a very innovative idea.

It has an interesting, uncommon feature: using the same framework, it's possible to create APIs and also CLIs.

As it is based on the previous standard for synchronous Python web frameworks (WSGI), it can't handle Websockets and other things, although it still has high performance too.

/// info

Hug was created by Timothy Crosley, the same creator of <a href="https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort" class="external-link" target="_blank">`isort`</a>, a great tool to automatically sort imports in Python files.

///

/// check | Ideas inspiring **FastAPI**

Hug inspired parts of APIStar, and was one of the tools I found most promising, alongside APIStar.

Hug helped inspiring **FastAPI** to use Python type hints to declare parameters, and to generate a schema defining the API automatically.

Hug inspired **FastAPI** to declare a `response` parameter in functions to set headers and cookies.

///

### <a href="https://github.com/encode/apistar" class="external-link" target="_blank">APIStar</a> (<= 0.5)

Right before deciding to build **FastAPI** I found **APIStar** server. It had almost everything I was looking for and had a great design.

It was one of the first implementations of a framework using Python type hints to declare parameters and requests that I ever saw (before NestJS and Molten). I found it more or less at the same time as Hug. But APIStar used the OpenAPI standard.

It had automatic data validation, data serialization and OpenAPI schema generation based on the same type hints in several places.

Body schema definitions didn't use the same Python type hints like Pydantic, it was a bit more similar to Marshmallow, so, editor support wouldn't be as good, but still, APIStar was the best available option.

It had the best performance benchmarks at the time (only surpassed by Starlette).

At first, it didn't have an automatic API documentation web UI, but I knew I could add Swagger UI to it.

It had a dependency injection system. It required pre-registration of components, as other tools discussed above. But still, it was a great feature.

I was never able to use it in a full project, as it didn't have security integration, so, I couldn't replace all the features I was having with the full-stack generators based on Flask-apispec. I had in my backlog of projects to create a pull request adding that functionality.

But then, the project's focus shifted.

It was no longer an API web framework, as the creator needed to focus on Starlette.

Now APIStar is a set of tools to validate OpenAPI specifications, not a web framework.

/// info

APIStar was created by Tom Christie. The same guy that created:

* Django REST Framework
* Starlette (in which **FastAPI** is based)
* Uvicorn (used by Starlette and **FastAPI**)

///

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Exist.

The idea of declaring multiple things (data validation, serialization and documentation) with the same Python types, that at the same time provided great editor support, was something I considered a brilliant idea.

And after searching for a long time for a similar framework and testing many different alternatives, APIStar was the best option available.

Then APIStar stopped to exist as a server and Starlette was created, and was a new better foundation for such a system. That was the final inspiration to build **FastAPI**.

I consider **FastAPI** a "spiritual successor" to APIStar, while improving and increasing the features, typing system, and other parts, based on the learnings from all these previous tools.

///

## Used by **FastAPI**

### <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic</a>

Pydantic is a library to define data validation, serialization and documentation (using JSON Schema) based on Python type hints.

That makes it extremely intuitive.

It is comparable to Marshmallow. Although it's faster than Marshmallow in benchmarks. And as it is based on the same Python type hints, the editor support is great.

/// check | **FastAPI** uses it to

Handle all the data validation, data serialization and automatic model documentation (based on JSON Schema).

**FastAPI** then takes that JSON Schema data and puts it in OpenAPI, apart from all the other things it does.

///

### <a href="https://www.starlette.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Starlette</a>

Starlette is a lightweight <abbr title="The new standard for building asynchronous Python web applications">ASGI</abbr> framework/toolkit, which is ideal for building high-performance asyncio services.

It is very simple and intuitive. It's designed to be easily extensible, and have modular components.

It has:

* Seriously impressive performance.
* WebSocket support.
* In-process background tasks.
* Startup and shutdown events.
* Test client built on HTTPX.
* CORS, GZip, Static Files, Streaming responses.
* Session and Cookie support.
* 100% test coverage.
* 100% type annotated codebase.
* Few hard dependencies.

Starlette is currently the fastest Python framework tested. Only surpassed by Uvicorn, which is not a framework, but a server.

Starlette provides all the basic web microframework functionality.

But it doesn't provide automatic data validation, serialization or documentation.

That's one of the main things that **FastAPI** adds on top, all based on Python type hints (using Pydantic). That, plus the dependency injection system, security utilities, OpenAPI schema generation, etc.

/// note | Technical Details

ASGI is a new "standard" being developed by Django core team members. It is still not a "Python standard" (a PEP), although they are in the process of doing that.

Nevertheless, it is already being used as a "standard" by several tools. This greatly improves interoperability, as you could switch Uvicorn for any other ASGI server (like Daphne or Hypercorn), or you could add ASGI compatible tools, like `python-socketio`.

///

/// check | **FastAPI** uses it to

Handle all the core web parts. Adding features on top.

The class `FastAPI` itself inherits directly from the class `Starlette`.

So, anything that you can do with Starlette, you can do it directly with **FastAPI**, as it is basically Starlette on steroids.

///

### <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Uvicorn</a>

Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server, built on uvloop and httptools.

It is not a web framework, but a server. For example, it doesn't provide tools for routing by paths. That's something that a framework like Starlette (or **FastAPI**) would provide on top.

It is the recommended server for Starlette and **FastAPI**.

/// check | **FastAPI** recommends it as

The main web server to run **FastAPI** applications.

You can also use the `--workers` command line option to have an asynchronous multi-process server.

# Concurrency and async / await

Details about the `async def` syntax for *path operation functions* and some background about asynchronous code, concurrency, and parallelism.

## In a hurry?

<abbr title="too long; didn't read"><strong>TL;DR:</strong></abbr>

If you are using third party libraries that tell you to call them with `await`, like:

```Python
results = await some_library()
```

Then, declare your *path operation functions* with `async def` like:

```Python hl_lines="2"
@app.get('/')
async def read_results():
    results = await some_library()
    return results
```

/// note

You can only use `await` inside of functions created with `async def`.

///

---

If you are using a third party library that communicates with something (a database, an API, the file system, etc.) and doesn't have support for using `await`, (this is currently the case for most database libraries), then declare your *path operation functions* as normally, with just `def`, like:

```Python hl_lines="2"
@app.get('/')
def results():
    results = some_library()
    return results
```

---

If your application (somehow) doesn't have to communicate with anything else and wait for it to respond, use `async def`, even if you don't need to use `await` inside.

---

If you just don't know, use normal `def`.

---

**Note**: You can mix `def` and `async def` in your *path operation functions* as much as you need and define each one using the best option for you. FastAPI will do the right thing with them.

Anyway, in any of the cases above, FastAPI will still work asynchronously and be extremely fast.

But by following the steps above, it will be able to do some performance optimizations.

## Technical Details

Modern versions of Python have support for **"asynchronous code"** using something called **"coroutines"**, with **`async` and `await`** syntax.

Let's see that phrase by parts in the sections below:

* **Asynchronous Code**
* **`async` and `await`**
* **Coroutines**

## Asynchronous Code

Asynchronous code just means that the language 💬 has a way to tell the computer / program 🤖 that at some point in the code, it 🤖 will have to wait for *something else* to finish somewhere else. Let's say that *something else* is called "slow-file" 📝.

So, during that time, the computer can go and do some other work, while "slow-file" 📝 finishes.

Then the computer / program 🤖 will come back every time it has a chance because it's waiting again, or whenever it 🤖 finished all the work it had at that point. And it 🤖 will see if any of the tasks it was waiting for have already finished, doing whatever it had to do.

Next, it 🤖 takes the first task to finish (let's say, our "slow-file" 📝) and continues whatever it had to do with it.

That "wait for something else" normally refers to <abbr title="Input and Output">I/O</abbr> operations that are relatively "slow" (compared to the speed of the processor and the RAM memory), like waiting for:

* the data from the client to be sent through the network
* the data sent by your program to be received by the client through the network
* the contents of a file in the disk to be read by the system and given to your program
* the contents your program gave to the system to be written to disk
* a remote API operation
* a database operation to finish
* a database query to return the results
* etc.

As the execution time is consumed mostly by waiting for <abbr title="Input and Output">I/O</abbr> operations, they call them "I/O bound" operations.

It's called "asynchronous" because the computer / program doesn't have to be "synchronized" with the slow task, waiting for the exact moment that the task finishes, while doing nothing, to be able to take the task result and continue the work.

Instead of that, by being an "asynchronous" system, once finished, the task can wait in line a little bit (some microseconds) for the computer / program to finish whatever it went to do, and then come back to take the results and continue working with them.

For "synchronous" (contrary to "asynchronous") they commonly also use the term "sequential", because the computer / program follows all the steps in sequence before switching to a different task, even if those steps involve waiting.

### Concurrency and Burgers

This idea of **asynchronous** code described above is also sometimes called **"concurrency"**. It is different from **"parallelism"**.

**Concurrency** and **parallelism** both relate to "different things happening more or less at the same time".

But the details between *concurrency* and *parallelism* are quite different.

To see the difference, imagine the following story about burgers:

### Concurrent Burgers

You go with your crush to get fast food, you stand in line while the cashier takes the orders from the people in front of you. 😍

<img src="/img/async/concurrent-burgers/concurrent-burgers-01.png" class="illustration">

Then it's your turn, you place your order of 2 very fancy burgers for your crush and you. 🍔🍔

<img src="/img/async/concurrent-burgers/concurrent-burgers-02.png" class="illustration">

The cashier says something to the cook in the kitchen so they know they have to prepare your burgers (even though they are currently preparing the ones for the previous clients).

<img src="/img/async/concurrent-burgers/concurrent-burgers-03.png" class="illustration">

You pay. 💸

The cashier gives you the number of your turn.

<img src="/img/async/concurrent-burgers/concurrent-burgers-04.png" class="illustration">

While you are waiting, you go with your crush and pick a table, you sit and talk with your crush for a long time (as your burgers are very fancy and take some time to prepare).

As you are sitting at the table with your crush, while you wait for the burgers, you can spend that time admiring how awesome, cute and smart your crush is ✨😍✨.

<img src="/img/async/concurrent-burgers/concurrent-burgers-05.png" class="illustration">

While waiting and talking to your crush, from time to time, you check the number displayed on the counter to see if it's your turn already.

Then at some point, it finally is your turn. You go to the counter, get your burgers and come back to the table.

<img src="/img/async/concurrent-burgers/concurrent-burgers-06.png" class="illustration">

You and your crush eat the burgers and have a nice time. ✨

///

---

Imagine you are the computer / program 🤖 in that story.

While you are at the line, you are just idle 😴, waiting for your turn, not doing anything very "productive". But the line is fast because the cashier is only taking the orders (not preparing them), so that's fine.

Then, when it's your turn, you do actual "productive" work, you process the menu, decide what you want, get your crush's choice, pay, check that you give the correct bill or card, check that you are charged correctly, check that the order has the correct items, etc.

But then, even though you still don't have your burgers, your work with the cashier is "on pause" ⏸, because you have to wait 🕙 for your burgers to be ready.

But as you go away from the counter and sit at the table with a number for your turn, you can switch 🔀 your attention to your crush, and "work" ⏯ 🤓 on that. Then you are again doing something very "productive" as is flirting with your crush 😍.

Then the cashier 💁 says "I'm finished with doing the burgers" by putting your number on the counter's display, but you don't jump like crazy immediately when the displayed number changes to your turn number. You know no one will steal your burgers because you have the number of your turn, and they have theirs.

So you wait for your crush to finish the story (finish the current work ⏯ / task being processed 🤓), smile gently and say that you are going for the burgers ⏸.

Then you go to the counter 🔀, to the initial task that is now finished ⏯, pick the burgers, say thanks and take them to the table. That finishes that step / task of interaction with the counter ⏹. That in turn, creates a new task, of "eating burgers" 🔀 ⏯, but the previous one of "getting burgers" is finished ⏹.

### Parallel Burgers

Now let's imagine these aren't "Concurrent Burgers", but "Parallel Burgers".

You go with your crush to get parallel fast food.

You stand in line while several (let's say 8) cashiers that at the same time are cooks take the orders from the people in front of you.

Everyone before you is waiting for their burgers to be ready before leaving the counter because each of the 8 cashiers goes and prepares the burger right away before getting the next order.

<img src="/img/async/parallel-burgers/parallel-burgers-01.png" class="illustration">

Then it's finally your turn, you place your order of 2 very fancy burgers for your crush and you.

You pay 💸.

<img src="/img/async/parallel-burgers/parallel-burgers-02.png" class="illustration">

The cashier goes to the kitchen.

You wait, standing in front of the counter 🕙, so that no one else takes your burgers before you do, as there are no numbers for turns.

<img src="/img/async/parallel-burgers/parallel-burgers-03.png" class="illustration">

As you and your crush are busy not letting anyone get in front of you and take your burgers whenever they arrive, you cannot pay attention to your crush. 😞

This is "synchronous" work, you are "synchronized" with the cashier/cook 👨‍🍳. You have to wait 🕙 and be there at the exact moment that the cashier/cook 👨‍🍳 finishes the burgers and gives them to you, or otherwise, someone else might take them.

<img src="/img/async/parallel-burgers/parallel-burgers-04.png" class="illustration">

Then your cashier/cook 👨‍🍳 finally comes back with your burgers, after a long time waiting 🕙 there in front of the counter.

<img src="/img/async/parallel-burgers/parallel-burgers-05.png" class="illustration">

You take your burgers and go to the table with your crush.

You just eat them, and you are done. ⏹

<img src="/img/async/parallel-burgers/parallel-burgers-06.png" class="illustration">

There was not much talk or flirting as most of the time was spent waiting 🕙 in front of the counter. 😞

---

In this scenario of the parallel burgers, you are a computer / program 🤖 with two processors (you and your crush), both waiting 🕙 and dedicating their attention ⏯ to be "waiting on the counter" 🕙 for a long time.

The fast food store has 8 processors (cashiers/cooks). While the concurrent burgers store might have had only 2 (one cashier and one cook).

But still, the final experience is not the best. 😞

---

This would be the parallel equivalent story for burgers. 🍔

For a more "real life" example of this, imagine a bank.

Up to recently, most of the banks had multiple cashiers 👨‍💼👨‍💼👨‍💼👨‍💼 and a big line 🕙🕙🕙🕙🕙🕙🕙🕙.

All of the cashiers doing all the work with one client after the other 👨‍💼⏯.

And you have to wait 🕙 in the line for a long time or you lose your turn.

You probably wouldn't want to take your crush 😍 with you to run errands at the bank 🏦.

### Burger Conclusion

In this scenario of "fast food burgers with your crush", as there is a lot of waiting 🕙, it makes a lot more sense to have a concurrent system ⏸🔀⏯.

This is the case for most of the web applications.

Many, many users, but your server is waiting 🕙 for their not-so-good connection to send their requests.

And then waiting 🕙 again for the responses to come back.

This "waiting" 🕙 is measured in microseconds, but still, summing it all, it's a lot of waiting in the end.

That's why it makes a lot of sense to use asynchronous ⏸🔀⏯ code for web APIs.

This kind of asynchronicity is what made NodeJS popular (even though NodeJS is not parallel) and that's the strength of Go as a programming language.

And that's the same level of performance you get with **FastAPI**.

And as you can have parallelism and asynchronicity at the same time, you get higher performance than most of the tested NodeJS frameworks and on par with Go, which is a compiled language closer to C <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17&hw=ph&test=query&l=zijmkf-1" class="external-link" target="_blank">(all thanks to Starlette)</a>.

### Is concurrency better than parallelism?

Nope! That's not the moral of the story.

Concurrency is different than parallelism. And it is better on **specific** scenarios that involve a lot of waiting. Because of that, it generally is a lot better than parallelism for web application development. But not for everything.

So, to balance that out, imagine the following short story:

> You have to clean a big, dirty house.

*Yep, that's the whole story*.

There's no waiting 🕙 anywhere, just a lot of work to be done, on multiple places of the house.

You could have turns as in the burgers example, first the living room, then the kitchen, but as you are not waiting 🕙 for anything, just cleaning and cleaning, the turns wouldn't affect anything.

It would take the same amount of time to finish with or without turns (concurrency) and you would have done the same amount of work.

But in this case, if you could bring the 8 ex-cashier/cooks/now-cleaners, and each one of them (plus you) could take a zone of the house to clean it, you could do all the work in **parallel**, with the extra help, and finish much sooner.

In this scenario, each one of the cleaners (including you) would be a processor, doing their part of the job.

And as most of the execution time is taken by actual work (instead of waiting), and the work in a computer is done by a <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr>, they call these problems "CPU bound".

---

Common examples of CPU bound operations are things that require complex math processing.

For example:

* **Audio** or **image processing**.
* **Computer vision**: an image is composed of millions of pixels, each pixel has 3 values / colors, processing that normally requires computing something on those pixels, all at the same time.
* **Machine Learning**: it normally requires lots of "matrix" and "vector" multiplications. Think of a huge spreadsheet with numbers and multiplying all of them together at the same time.
* **Deep Learning**: this is a sub-field of Machine Learning, so, the same applies. It's just that there is not a single spreadsheet of numbers to multiply, but a huge set of them, and in many cases, you use a special processor to build and / or use those models.

### Concurrency + Parallelism: Web + Machine Learning

With **FastAPI** you can take advantage of concurrency that is very common for web development (the same main attraction of NodeJS).

But you can also exploit the benefits of parallelism and multiprocessing (having multiple processes running in parallel) for **CPU bound** workloads like those in Machine Learning systems.

That, plus the simple fact that Python is the main language for **Data Science**, Machine Learning and especially Deep Learning, make FastAPI a very good match for Data Science / Machine Learning web APIs and applications (among many others).

To see how to achieve this parallelism in production see the section about [Deployment](deployment/index.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

## `async` and `await`

Modern versions of Python have a very intuitive way to define asynchronous code. This makes it look just like normal "sequential" code and do the "awaiting" for you at the right moments.

When there is an operation that will require waiting before giving the results and has support for these new Python features, you can code it like:

```Python
burgers = await get_burgers(2)
```

The key here is the `await`. It tells Python that it has to wait ⏸ for `get_burgers(2)` to finish doing its thing 🕙 before storing the results in `burgers`. With that, Python will know that it can go and do something else 🔀 ⏯ in the meanwhile (like receiving another request).

For `await` to work, it has to be inside a function that supports this asynchronicity. To do that, you just declare it with `async def`:

```Python hl_lines="1"
async def get_burgers(number: int):
    # Do some asynchronous stuff to create the burgers
    return burgers
```

...instead of `def`:

```Python hl_lines="2"
# This is not asynchronous
def get_sequential_burgers(number: int):
    # Do some sequential stuff to create the burgers
    return burgers
```

With `async def`, Python knows that, inside that function, it has to be aware of `await` expressions, and that it can "pause" ⏸ the execution of that function and go do something else 🔀 before coming back.

When you want to call an `async def` function, you have to "await" it. So, this won't work:

```Python
# This won't work, because get_burgers was defined with: async def
burgers = get_burgers(2)
```

---

So, if you are using a library that tells you that you can call it with `await`, you need to create the *path operation functions* that uses it with `async def`, like in:

```Python hl_lines="2-3"
@app.get('/burgers')
async def read_burgers():
    burgers = await get_burgers(2)
    return burgers
```

### More technical details

You might have noticed that `await` can only be used inside of functions defined with `async def`.

But at the same time, functions defined with `async def` have to be "awaited". So, functions with `async def` can only be called inside of functions defined with `async def` too.

So, about the egg and the chicken, how do you call the first `async` function?

If you are working with **FastAPI** you don't have to worry about that, because that "first" function will be your *path operation function*, and FastAPI will know how to do the right thing.

But if you want to use `async` / `await` without FastAPI, you can do it as well.

### Write your own async code

Starlette (and **FastAPI**) are based on <a href="https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" class="external-link" target="_blank">AnyIO</a>, which makes it compatible with both Python's standard library <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html" class="external-link" target="_blank">asyncio</a> and <a href="https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Trio</a>.

In particular, you can directly use <a href="https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" class="external-link" target="_blank">AnyIO</a> for your advanced concurrency use cases that require more advanced patterns in your own code.

And even if you were not using FastAPI, you could also write your own async applications with <a href="https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" class="external-link" target="_blank">AnyIO</a> to be highly compatible and get its benefits (e.g. *structured concurrency*).

I created another library on top of AnyIO, as a thin layer on top, to improve a bit the type annotations and get better **autocompletion**, **inline errors**, etc. It also has a friendly introduction and tutorial to help you **understand** and write **your own async code**: <a href="https://asyncer.tiangolo.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Asyncer</a>. It would be particularly useful if you need to **combine async code with regular** (blocking/synchronous) code.

### Other forms of asynchronous code

This style of using `async` and `await` is relatively new in the language.

But it makes working with asynchronous code a lot easier.

This same syntax (or almost identical) was also included recently in modern versions of JavaScript (in Browser and NodeJS).

But before that, handling asynchronous code was quite more complex and difficult.

In previous versions of Python, you could have used threads or <a href="https://www.gevent.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Gevent</a>. But the code is way more complex to understand, debug, and think about.

In previous versions of NodeJS / Browser JavaScript, you would have used "callbacks". Which leads to <a href="http://callbackhell.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">callback hell</a>.

## Coroutines

**Coroutine** is just the very fancy term for the thing returned by an `async def` function. Python knows that it is something like a function, that it can start and that it will end at some point, but that it might be paused ⏸ internally too, whenever there is an `await` inside of it.

But all this functionality of using asynchronous code with `async` and `await` is many times summarized as using "coroutines". It is comparable to the main key feature of Go, the "Goroutines".

## Conclusion

Let's see the same phrase from above:

> Modern versions of Python have support for **"asynchronous code"** using something called **"coroutines"**, with **`async` and `await`** syntax.

That should make more sense now. ✨

All that is what powers FastAPI (through Starlette) and what makes it have such an impressive performance.

## Very Technical Details

/// warning

You can probably skip this.

These are very technical details of how **FastAPI** works underneath.

If you have quite some technical knowledge (coroutines, threads, blocking, etc.) and are curious about how FastAPI handles `async def` vs normal `def`, go ahead.

///

### Path operation functions

When you declare a *path operation function* with normal `def` instead of `async def`, it is run in an external threadpool that is then awaited, instead of being called directly (as it would block the server).

If you are coming from another async framework that does not work in the way described above and you are used to defining trivial compute-only *path operation functions* with plain `def` for a tiny performance gain (about 100 nanoseconds), please note that in **FastAPI** the effect would be quite opposite. In these cases, it's better to use `async def` unless your *path operation functions* use code that performs blocking <abbr title="Input/Output: disk reading or writing, network communications.">I/O</abbr>.

Still, in both situations, chances are that **FastAPI** will [still be faster](index.md#performance){.internal-link target=_blank} than (or at least comparable to) your previous framework.

### Dependencies

The same applies for [dependencies](tutorial/dependencies/index.md){.internal-link target=_blank}. If a dependency is a standard `def` function instead of `async def`, it is run in the external threadpool.

### Sub-dependencies

You can have multiple dependencies and [sub-dependencies](tutorial/dependencies/sub-dependencies.md){.internal-link target=_blank} requiring each other (as parameters of the function definitions), some of them might be created with `async def` and some with normal `def`. It would still work, and the ones created with normal `def` would be called on an external thread (from the threadpool) instead of being "awaited".

### Other utility functions

Any other utility function that you call directly can be created with normal `def` or `async def` and FastAPI won't affect the way you call it.

This is in contrast to the functions that FastAPI calls for you: *path operation functions* and dependencies.

If your utility function is a normal function with `def`, it will be called directly (as you write it in your code), not in a threadpool, if the function is created with `async def` then you should `await` for that function when you call it in your code.

---

Again, these are very technical details that would probably be useful if you came searching for them.

Otherwise, you should be good with the guidelines from the section above: <a href="#in-a-hurry">In a hurry?</a>.

# Benchmarks

Independent TechEmpower benchmarks show **FastAPI** applications running under Uvicorn as <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=test&runid=7464e520-0dc2-473d-bd34-dbdfd7e85911&hw=ph&test=query&l=zijzen-7" class="external-link" target="_blank">one of the fastest Python frameworks available</a>, only below Starlette and Uvicorn themselves (used internally by FastAPI).

But when checking benchmarks and comparisons you should keep the following in mind.

## Benchmarks and speed

When you check the benchmarks, it is common to see several tools of different types compared as equivalent.

Specifically, to see Uvicorn, Starlette and FastAPI compared together (among many other tools).

The simpler the problem solved by the tool, the better performance it will get. And most of the benchmarks don't test the additional features provided by the tool.

The hierarchy is like:

* **Uvicorn**: an ASGI server
    * **Starlette**: (uses Uvicorn) a web microframework
        * **FastAPI**: (uses Starlette) an API microframework with several additional features for building APIs, with data validation, etc.

* **Uvicorn**:
    * Will have the best performance, as it doesn't have much extra code apart from the server itself.
    * You wouldn't write an application in Uvicorn directly. That would mean that your code would have to include more or less, at least, all the code provided by Starlette (or **FastAPI**). And if you did that, your final application would have the same overhead as having used a framework and minimizing your app code and bugs.
    * If you are comparing Uvicorn, compare it against Daphne, Hypercorn, uWSGI, etc. Application servers.
* **Starlette**:
    * Will have the next best performance, after Uvicorn. In fact, Starlette uses Uvicorn to run. So, it probably can only get "slower" than Uvicorn by having to execute more code.
    * But it provides you the tools to build simple web applications, with routing based on paths, etc.
    * If you are comparing Starlette, compare it against Sanic, Flask, Django, etc. Web frameworks (or microframeworks).
* **FastAPI**:
    * The same way that Starlette uses Uvicorn and cannot be faster than it, **FastAPI** uses Starlette, so it cannot be faster than it.
    * FastAPI provides more features on top of Starlette. Features that you almost always need when building APIs, like data validation and serialization. And by using it, you get automatic documentation for free (the automatic documentation doesn't even add overhead to running applications, it is generated on startup).
    * If you didn't use FastAPI and used Starlette directly (or another tool, like Sanic, Flask, Responder, etc) you would have to implement all the data validation and serialization yourself. So, your final application would still have the same overhead as if it was built using FastAPI. And in many cases, this data validation and serialization is the biggest amount of code written in applications.
    * So, by using FastAPI you are saving development time, bugs, lines of code, and you would probably get the same performance (or better) you would if you didn't use it (as you would have to implement it all in your code).
    * If you are comparing FastAPI, compare it against a web application framework (or set of tools) that provides data validation, serialization and documentation, like Flask-apispec, NestJS, Molten, etc. Frameworks with integrated automatic data validation, serialization and documentation.

# Development - Contributing

First, you might want to see the basic ways to [help FastAPI and get help](help-fastapi.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

## Developing

If you already cloned the <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi" class="external-link" target="_blank">fastapi repository</a> and you want to deep dive in the code, here are some guidelines to set up your environment.

### Virtual environment

Follow the instructions to create and activate a [virtual environment](virtual-environments.md){.internal-link target=_blank} for the internal code of `fastapi`.

### Install requirements using pip

After activating the environment, install the required packages:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

---> 100%
```

</div>

It will install all the dependencies and your local FastAPI in your local environment.

### Using your local FastAPI

If you create a Python file that imports and uses FastAPI, and run it with the Python from your local environment, it will use your cloned local FastAPI source code.

And if you update that local FastAPI source code when you run that Python file again, it will use the fresh version of FastAPI you just edited.

That way, you don't have to "install" your local version to be able to test every change.

/// note | Technical Details

This only happens when you install using this included `requirements.txt` instead of running `pip install fastapi` directly.

That is because inside the `requirements.txt` file, the local version of FastAPI is marked to be installed in "editable" mode, with the `-e` option.

///

### Format the code

There is a script that you can run that will format and clean all your code:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ bash scripts/format.sh
```

</div>

It will also auto-sort all your imports.

## Tests

There is a script that you can run locally to test all the code and generate coverage reports in HTML:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ bash scripts/test-cov-html.sh
```

</div>

This command generates a directory `./htmlcov/`, if you open the file `./htmlcov/index.html` in your browser, you can explore interactively the regions of code that are covered by the tests, and notice if there is any region missing.

## Docs

First, make sure you set up your environment as described above, that will install all the requirements.

### Docs live

During local development, there is a script that builds the site and checks for any changes, live-reloading:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ python ./scripts/docs.py live

<span style="color: green;">[INFO]</span> Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8008
<span style="color: green;">[INFO]</span> Start watching changes
<span style="color: green;">[INFO]</span> Start detecting changes
```

</div>

It will serve the documentation on `http://127.0.0.1:8008`.

That way, you can edit the documentation/source files and see the changes live.

/// tip

Alternatively, you can perform the same steps that scripts does manually.

Go into the language directory, for the main docs in English it's at `docs/en/`:

```console
$ cd docs/en/
```

Then run `mkdocs` in that directory:

```console
$ mkdocs serve --dev-addr 127.0.0.1:8008
```

///

#### Typer CLI (optional)

The instructions here show you how to use the script at `./scripts/docs.py` with the `python` program directly.

But you can also use <a href="https://typer.tiangolo.com/typer-cli/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Typer CLI</a>, and you will get autocompletion in your terminal for the commands after installing completion.

If you install Typer CLI, you can install completion with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ typer --install-completion

zsh completion installed in /home/user/.bashrc.
Completion will take effect once you restart the terminal.
```

</div>

### Docs Structure

The documentation uses <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">MkDocs</a>.

And there are extra tools/scripts in place to handle translations in `./scripts/docs.py`.

/// tip

You don't need to see the code in `./scripts/docs.py`, you just use it in the command line.

///

All the documentation is in Markdown format in the directory `./docs/en/`.

Many of the tutorials have blocks of code.

In most of the cases, these blocks of code are actual complete applications that can be run as is.

In fact, those blocks of code are not written inside the Markdown, they are Python files in the `./docs_src/` directory.

And those Python files are included/injected in the documentation when generating the site.

### Docs for tests

Most of the tests actually run against the example source files in the documentation.

This helps to make sure that:

* The documentation is up-to-date.
* The documentation examples can be run as is.
* Most of the features are covered by the documentation, ensured by test coverage.

#### Apps and docs at the same time

If you run the examples with, e.g.:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ fastapi dev tutorial001.py

<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

</div>

as Uvicorn by default will use the port `8000`, the documentation on port `8008` won't clash.

### Translations

Help with translations is VERY MUCH appreciated! And it can't be done without the help from the community. 🌎 🚀

Here are the steps to help with translations.

#### Tips and guidelines

* Check the currently <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/pulls" class="external-link" target="_blank">existing pull requests</a> for your language. You can filter the pull requests by the ones with the label for your language. For example, for Spanish, the label is <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Alang-es+label%3Aawaiting-review" class="external-link" target="_blank">`lang-es`</a>.

* Review those pull requests, requesting changes or approving them. For the languages I don't speak, I'll wait for several others to review the translation before merging.

/// tip

You can <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request" class="external-link" target="_blank">add comments with change suggestions</a> to existing pull requests.

Check the docs about <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews" class="external-link" target="_blank">adding a pull request review</a> to approve it or request changes.

///

* Check if there's a <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/discussions/categories/translations" class="external-link" target="_blank">GitHub Discussion</a> to coordinate translations for your language. You can subscribe to it, and when there's a new pull request to review, an automatic comment will be added to the discussion.

* If you translate pages, add a single pull request per page translated. That will make it much easier for others to review it.

* To check the 2-letter code for the language you want to translate, you can use the table <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes" class="external-link" target="_blank">List of ISO 639-1 codes</a>.

#### Existing language

Let's say you want to translate a page for a language that already has translations for some pages, like Spanish.

In the case of Spanish, the 2-letter code is `es`. So, the directory for Spanish translations is located at `docs/es/`.

/// tip

The main ("official") language is English, located at `docs/en/`.

///

Now run the live server for the docs in Spanish:

<div class="termy">

```console
// Use the command "live" and pass the language code as a CLI argument
$ python ./scripts/docs.py live es

<span style="color: green;">[INFO]</span> Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8008
<span style="color: green;">[INFO]</span> Start watching changes
<span style="color: green;">[INFO]</span> Start detecting changes
```

</div>

/// tip

Alternatively, you can perform the same steps that scripts does manually.

Go into the language directory, for the Spanish translations it's at `docs/es/`:

```console
$ cd docs/es/
```

Then run `mkdocs` in that directory:

```console
$ mkdocs serve --dev-addr 127.0.0.1:8008
```

///

Now you can go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8008" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8008</a> and see your changes live.

You will see that every language has all the pages. But some pages are not translated and have an info box at the top, about the missing translation.

Now let's say that you want to add a translation for the section [Features](features.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

* Copy the file at:

```
docs/en/docs/features.md
```

* Paste it in exactly the same location but for the language you want to translate, e.g.:

```
docs/es/docs/features.md
```

/// tip

Notice that the only change in the path and file name is the language code, from `en` to `es`.

///

If you go to your browser you will see that now the docs show your new section (the info box at the top is gone). 🎉

Now you can translate it all and see how it looks as you save the file.

#### Don't Translate these Pages

🚨 Don't translate:

* Files under `reference/`
* `release-notes.md`
* `fastapi-people.md`
* `external-links.md`
* `newsletter.md`
* `management-tasks.md`
* `management.md`
* `contributing.md`

Some of these files are updated very frequently and a translation would always be behind, or they include the main content from English source files, etc.

#### New Language

Let's say that you want to add translations for a language that is not yet translated, not even some pages.

Let's say you want to add translations for Creole, and it's not yet there in the docs.

Checking the link from above, the code for "Creole" is `ht`.

The next step is to run the script to generate a new translation directory:

<div class="termy">

```console
// Use the command new-lang, pass the language code as a CLI argument
$ python ./scripts/docs.py new-lang ht

Successfully initialized: docs/ht
```

</div>

Now you can check in your code editor the newly created directory `docs/ht/`.

That command created a file `docs/ht/mkdocs.yml` with a simple config that inherits everything from the `en` version:

```yaml
INHERIT: ../en/mkdocs.yml
```

/// tip

You could also simply create that file with those contents manually.

///

That command also created a dummy file `docs/ht/index.md` for the main page, you can start by translating that one.

You can continue with the previous instructions for an "Existing Language" for that process.

You can make the first pull request with those two files, `docs/ht/mkdocs.yml` and `docs/ht/index.md`. 🎉

#### Preview the result

As already mentioned above, you can use the `./scripts/docs.py` with the `live` command to preview the results (or `mkdocs serve`).

Once you are done, you can also test it all as it would look online, including all the other languages.

To do that, first build all the docs:

<div class="termy">

```console
// Use the command "build-all", this will take a bit
$ python ./scripts/docs.py build-all

Building docs for: en
Building docs for: es
Successfully built docs for: es
```

</div>

This builds all those independent MkDocs sites for each language, combines them, and generates the final output at `./site/`.

Then you can serve that with the command `serve`:

<div class="termy">

```console
// Use the command "serve" after running "build-all"
$ python ./scripts/docs.py serve

Warning: this is a very simple server. For development, use mkdocs serve instead.
This is here only to preview a site with translations already built.
Make sure you run the build-all command first.
Serving at: http://127.0.0.1:8008
```

</div>

#### Translation specific tips and guidelines

* Translate only the Markdown documents (`.md`). Do not translate the code examples at `./docs_src`.

* In code blocks within the Markdown document, translate comments (`# a comment`), but leave the rest unchanged.

* Do not change anything enclosed in "``" (inline code).

* In lines starting with `///` translate only the text part after `|`. Leave the rest unchanged.

* You can translate info boxes like `/// warning` with for example `/// warning | Achtung`. But do not change the word immediately after the `///`, it determines the color of the info box.

* Do not change the paths in links to images, code files, Markdown documents.

* However, when a Markdown document is translated, the `#hash-parts` in links to its headings may change. Update these links if possible.
    * Search for such links in the translated document using the regex `#[^# ]`.
    * Search in all documents already translated into your language for `your-translated-document.md`. For example VS Code has an option "Edit" -> "Find in Files".
    * When translating a document, do not "pre-translate" `#hash-parts` that link to headings in untranslated documents.

# Environment Variables

/// tip

If you already know what "environment variables" are and how to use them, feel free to skip this.

///

An environment variable (also known as "**env var**") is a variable that lives **outside** of the Python code, in the **operating system**, and could be read by your Python code (or by other programs as well).

Environment variables could be useful for handling application **settings**, as part of the **installation** of Python, etc.

## Create and Use Env Vars

You can **create** and use environment variables in the **shell (terminal)**, without needing Python:

//// tab | Linux, macOS, Windows Bash

<div class="termy">

```console
// You could create an env var MY_NAME with
$ export MY_NAME="Wade Wilson"

// Then you could use it with other programs, like
$ echo "Hello $MY_NAME"

Hello Wade Wilson
```

</div>

////

//// tab | Windows PowerShell

<div class="termy">

```console
// Create an env var MY_NAME
$ $Env:MY_NAME = "Wade Wilson"

// Use it with other programs, like
$ echo "Hello $Env:MY_NAME"

Hello Wade Wilson
```

</div>

////

## Read env vars in Python

You could also create environment variables **outside** of Python, in the terminal (or with any other method), and then **read them in Python**.

For example you could have a file `main.py` with:

```Python hl_lines="3"
import os

name = os.getenv("MY_NAME", "World")
print(f"Hello {name} from Python")
```

/// tip

The second argument to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/os.html#os.getenv" class="external-link" target="_blank">`os.getenv()`</a> is the default value to return.

If not provided, it's `None` by default, here we provide `"World"` as the default value to use.

///

Then you could call that Python program:

//// tab | Linux, macOS, Windows Bash

<div class="termy">

```console
// Here we don't set the env var yet
$ python main.py

// As we didn't set the env var, we get the default value

Hello World from Python

// But if we create an environment variable first
$ export MY_NAME="Wade Wilson"

// And then call the program again
$ python main.py

// Now it can read the environment variable

Hello Wade Wilson from Python
```

</div>

////

//// tab | Windows PowerShell

<div class="termy">

```console
// Here we don't set the env var yet
$ python main.py

// As we didn't set the env var, we get the default value

Hello World from Python

// But if we create an environment variable first
$ $Env:MY_NAME = "Wade Wilson"

// And then call the program again
$ python main.py

// Now it can read the environment variable

Hello Wade Wilson from Python
```

</div>

////

As environment variables can be set outside of the code, but can be read by the code, and don't have to be stored (committed to `git`) with the rest of the files, it's common to use them for configurations or **settings**.

You can also create an environment variable only for a **specific program invocation**, that is only available to that program, and only for its duration.

To do that, create it right before the program itself, on the same line:

<div class="termy">

```console
// Create an env var MY_NAME in line for this program call
$ MY_NAME="Wade Wilson" python main.py

// Now it can read the environment variable

Hello Wade Wilson from Python

// The env var no longer exists afterwards
$ python main.py

Hello World from Python
```

</div>

/// tip

You can read more about it at <a href="https://12factor.net/config" class="external-link" target="_blank">The Twelve-Factor App: Config</a>.

///

## Types and Validation

These environment variables can only handle **text strings**, as they are external to Python and have to be compatible with other programs and the rest of the system (and even with different operating systems, as Linux, Windows, macOS).

That means that **any value** read in Python from an environment variable **will be a `str`**, and any conversion to a different type or any validation has to be done in code.

You will learn more about using environment variables for handling **application settings** in the [Advanced User Guide - Settings and Environment Variables](./advanced/settings.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

## `PATH` Environment Variable

There is a **special** environment variable called **`PATH`** that is used by the operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) to find programs to run.

The value of the variable `PATH` is a long string that is made of directories separated by a colon `:` on Linux and macOS, and by a semicolon `;` on Windows.

For example, the `PATH` environment variable could look like this:

//// tab | Linux, macOS

```plaintext
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

This means that the system should look for programs in the directories:

* `/usr/local/bin`
* `/usr/bin`
* `/bin`
* `/usr/sbin`
* `/sbin`

////

//// tab | Windows

```plaintext
C:\Program Files\Python312\Scripts;C:\Program Files\Python312;C:\Windows\System32
```

This means that the system should look for programs in the directories:

* `C:\Program Files\Python312\Scripts`
* `C:\Program Files\Python312`
* `C:\Windows\System32`

////

When you type a **command** in the terminal, the operating system **looks for** the program in **each of those directories** listed in the `PATH` environment variable.

For example, when you type `python` in the terminal, the operating system looks for a program called `python` in the **first directory** in that list.

If it finds it, then it will **use it**. Otherwise it keeps looking in the **other directories**.

### Installing Python and Updating the `PATH`

When you install Python, you might be asked if you want to update the `PATH` environment variable.

//// tab | Linux, macOS

Let's say you install Python and it ends up in a directory `/opt/custompython/bin`.

If you say yes to update the `PATH` environment variable, then the installer will add `/opt/custompython/bin` to the `PATH` environment variable.

It could look like this:

```plaintext
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/custompython/bin
```

This way, when you type `python` in the terminal, the system will find the Python program in `/opt/custompython/bin` (the last directory) and use that one.

////

//// tab | Windows

Let's say you install Python and it ends up in a directory `C:\opt\custompython\bin`.

If you say yes to update the `PATH` environment variable, then the installer will add `C:\opt\custompython\bin` to the `PATH` environment variable.

```plaintext
C:\Program Files\Python312\Scripts;C:\Program Files\Python312;C:\Windows\System32;C:\opt\custompython\bin
```

This way, when you type `python` in the terminal, the system will find the Python program in `C:\opt\custompython\bin` (the last directory) and use that one.

////

So, if you type:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ python
```

</div>

//// tab | Linux, macOS

The system will **find** the `python` program in `/opt/custompython/bin` and run it.

It would be roughly equivalent to typing:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ /opt/custompython/bin/python
```

</div>

////

//// tab | Windows

The system will **find** the `python` program in `C:\opt\custompython\bin\python` and run it.

It would be roughly equivalent to typing:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ C:\opt\custompython\bin\python
```

</div>

////

This information will be useful when learning about [Virtual Environments](virtual-environments.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

## Conclusion

With this you should have a basic understanding of what **environment variables** are and how to use them in Python.

You can also read more about them in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable" class="external-link" target="_blank">Wikipedia for Environment Variable</a>.

In many cases it's not very obvious how environment variables would be useful and applicable right away. But they keep showing up in many different scenarios when you are developing, so it's good to know about them.

For example, you will need this information in the next section, about [Virtual Environments](virtual-environments.md).

# FastAPI CLI

**FastAPI CLI** is a command line program that you can use to serve your FastAPI app, manage your FastAPI project, and more.

When you install FastAPI (e.g. with `pip install "fastapi[standard]"`), it includes a package called `fastapi-cli`, this package provides the `fastapi` command in the terminal.

To run your FastAPI app for development, you can use the `fastapi dev` command:

<div class="termy">

```console

```

</div>

The command line program called `fastapi` is **FastAPI CLI**.

FastAPI CLI takes the path to your Python program (e.g. `main.py`) and automatically detects the `FastAPI` instance (commonly named `app`), determines the correct import process, and then serves it.

For production you would use `fastapi run` instead. 🚀

Internally, **FastAPI CLI** uses <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org" class="external-link" target="_blank">Uvicorn</a>, a high-performance, production-ready, ASGI server. 😎

## `fastapi dev`

Running `fastapi dev` initiates development mode.

By default, **auto-reload** is enabled, automatically reloading the server when you make changes to your code. This is resource-intensive and could be less stable than when it's disabled. You should only use it for development. It also listens on the IP address `127.0.0.1`, which is the IP for your machine to communicate with itself alone (`localhost`).

## `fastapi run`

Executing `fastapi run` starts FastAPI in production mode by default.

By default, **auto-reload** is disabled. It also listens on the IP address `0.0.0.0`, which means all the available IP addresses, this way it will be publicly accessible to anyone that can communicate with the machine. This is how you would normally run it in production, for example, in a container.

In most cases you would (and should) have a "termination proxy" handling HTTPS for you on top, this will depend on how you deploy your application, your provider might do this for you, or you might need to set it up yourself.

## About the data - technical details

The main intention of this page is to highlight the effort of the community to help others.

Especially including efforts that are normally less visible, and in many cases more arduous, like helping others with questions and reviewing Pull Requests with translations.

The data is calculated each month, you can read the <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/blob/master/scripts/" class="external-link" target="_blank">source code here</a>.

Here I'm also highlighting contributions from sponsors.

# Features

## FastAPI features

**FastAPI** gives you the following:

### Based on open standards

* <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification" class="external-link" target="_blank"><strong>OpenAPI</strong></a> for API creation, including declarations of <abbr title="also known as: endpoints, routes">path</abbr> <abbr title="also known as HTTP methods, as POST, GET, PUT, DELETE">operations</abbr>, parameters, request bodies, security, etc.
* Automatic data model documentation with <a href="https://json-schema.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank"><strong>JSON Schema</strong></a> (as OpenAPI itself is based on JSON Schema).
* Designed around these standards, after a meticulous study. Instead of an afterthought layer on top.
* This also allows using automatic **client code generation** in many languages.

### Automatic docs

Interactive API documentation and exploration web user interfaces. As the framework is based on OpenAPI, there are multiple options, 2 included by default.

* <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui" class="external-link" target="_blank"><strong>Swagger UI</strong></a>, with interactive exploration, call and test your API directly from the browser.

![Swagger UI interaction](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-03-swagger-02.png)

* Alternative API documentation with <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc" class="external-link" target="_blank"><strong>ReDoc</strong></a>.

![ReDoc](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-06-redoc-02.png)

### Just Modern Python

It's all based on standard **Python type** declarations (thanks to Pydantic). No new syntax to learn. Just standard modern Python.

If you need a 2 minute refresher of how to use Python types (even if you don't use FastAPI), check the short tutorial: [Python Types](python-types.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

You write standard Python with types:

```Python
from datetime import date

from pydantic import BaseModel

# Declare a variable as a str
# and get editor support inside the function
def main(user_id: str):
    return user_id


# A Pydantic model
class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    joined: date
```

That can then be used like:

```Python
my_user: User = User(id=3, name="John Doe", joined="2018-07-19")

second_user_data = {
    "id": 4,
    "name": "Mary",
    "joined": "2018-11-30",
}

my_second_user: User = User(**second_user_data)
```

/// info

`**second_user_data` means:

Pass the keys and values of the `second_user_data` dict directly as key-value arguments, equivalent to: `User(id=4, name="Mary", joined="2018-11-30")`

///

### Editor support

All the framework was designed to be easy and intuitive to use, all the decisions were tested on multiple editors even before starting development, to ensure the best development experience.

In the Python developer surveys, it's clear <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2017/#tools-and-features" class="external-link" target="_blank">that one of the most used features is "autocompletion"</a>.

The whole **FastAPI** framework is based to satisfy that. Autocompletion works everywhere.

You will rarely need to come back to the docs.

Here's how your editor might help you:

* in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>:

![editor support](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/vscode-completion.png)

* in <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" class="external-link" target="_blank">PyCharm</a>:

![editor support](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/pycharm-completion.png)

You will get completion in code you might even consider impossible before. As for example, the `price` key inside a JSON body (that could have been nested) that comes from a request.

No more typing the wrong key names, coming back and forth between docs, or scrolling up and down to find if you finally used `username` or `user_name`.

### Short

It has sensible **defaults** for everything, with optional configurations everywhere. All the parameters can be fine-tuned to do what you need and to define the API you need.

But by default, it all **"just works"**.

### Validation

* Validation for most (or all?) Python **data types**, including:
    * JSON objects (`dict`).
    * JSON array (`list`) defining item types.
    * String (`str`) fields, defining min and max lengths.
    * Numbers (`int`, `float`) with min and max values, etc.

* Validation for more exotic types, like:
    * URL.
    * Email.
    * UUID.
    * ...and others.

All the validation is handled by the well-established and robust **Pydantic**.

### Security and authentication

Security and authentication integrated. Without any compromise with databases or data models.

All the security schemes defined in OpenAPI, including:

* HTTP Basic.
* **OAuth2** (also with **JWT tokens**). Check the tutorial on [OAuth2 with JWT](tutorial/security/oauth2-jwt.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.
* API keys in:
    * Headers.
    * Query parameters.
    * Cookies, etc.

Plus all the security features from Starlette (including **session cookies**).

All built as reusable tools and components that are easy to integrate with your systems, data stores, relational and NoSQL databases, etc.

### Dependency Injection

FastAPI includes an extremely easy to use, but extremely powerful <abbr title='also known as "components", "resources", "services", "providers"'><strong>Dependency Injection</strong></abbr> system.

* Even dependencies can have dependencies, creating a hierarchy or **"graph" of dependencies**.
* All **automatically handled** by the framework.
* All the dependencies can require data from requests and **augment the path operation** constraints and automatic documentation.
* **Automatic validation** even for *path operation* parameters defined in dependencies.
* Support for complex user authentication systems, **database connections**, etc.
* **No compromise** with databases, frontends, etc. But easy integration with all of them.

### Unlimited "plug-ins"

Or in other way, no need for them, import and use the code you need.

Any integration is designed to be so simple to use (with dependencies) that you can create a "plug-in" for your application in 2 lines of code using the same structure and syntax used for your *path operations*.

### Tested

* 100% <abbr title="The amount of code that is automatically tested">test coverage</abbr>.
* 100% <abbr title="Python type annotations, with this your editor and external tools can give you better support">type annotated</abbr> code base.
* Used in production applications.

## Starlette features

**FastAPI** is fully compatible with (and based on) <a href="https://www.starlette.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank"><strong>Starlette</strong></a>. So, any additional Starlette code you have, will also work.

`FastAPI` is actually a sub-class of `Starlette`. So, if you already know or use Starlette, most of the functionality will work the same way.

With **FastAPI** you get all of **Starlette**'s features (as FastAPI is just Starlette on steroids):

* Seriously impressive performance. It is <a href="https://github.com/encode/starlette#performance" class="external-link" target="_blank">one of the fastest Python frameworks available, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go**</a>.
* **WebSocket** support.
* In-process background tasks.
* Startup and shutdown events.
* Test client built on HTTPX.
* **CORS**, GZip, Static Files, Streaming responses.
* **Session and Cookie** support.
* 100% test coverage.
* 100% type annotated codebase.

## Pydantic features

**FastAPI** is fully compatible with (and based on) <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank"><strong>Pydantic</strong></a>. So, any additional Pydantic code you have, will also work.

Including external libraries also based on Pydantic, as <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper">ORM</abbr>s, <abbr title="Object-Document Mapper">ODM</abbr>s for databases.

This also means that in many cases you can pass the same object you get from a request **directly to the database**, as everything is validated automatically.

The same applies the other way around, in many cases you can just pass the object you get from the database **directly to the client**.

With **FastAPI** you get all of **Pydantic**'s features (as FastAPI is based on Pydantic for all the data handling):

* **No brainfuck**:
    * No new schema definition micro-language to learn.
    * If you know Python types you know how to use Pydantic.
* Plays nicely with your **<abbr title="Integrated Development Environment, similar to a code editor">IDE</abbr>/<abbr title="A program that checks for code errors">linter</abbr>/brain**:
    * Because pydantic data structures are just instances of classes you define; auto-completion, linting, mypy and your intuition should all work properly with your validated data.
* Validate **complex structures**:
    * Use of hierarchical Pydantic models, Python `typing`’s `List` and `Dict`, etc.
    * And validators allow complex data schemas to be clearly and easily defined, checked and documented as JSON Schema.
    * You can have deeply **nested JSON** objects and have them all validated and annotated.
* **Extensible**:
    * Pydantic allows custom data types to be defined or you can extend validation with methods on a model decorated with the validator decorator.
* 100% test coverage.

If you are helping a lot of people with their questions, you will become an official [FastAPI Expert](fastapi-people.md#fastapi-experts){.internal-link target=_blank}. 🎉

Just remember, the most important point is: try to be kind. People come with their frustrations and in many cases don't ask in the best way, but try as best as you can to be kind. 🤗

The idea is for the **FastAPI** community to be kind and welcoming. At the same time, don't accept bullying or disrespectful behavior towards others. We have to take care of each other.

---

Here's how to help others with questions (in discussions or issues):

### Understand the question

* Check if you can understand what is the **purpose** and use case of the person asking.

* Then check if the question (the vast majority are questions) is **clear**.

* In many cases the question asked is about an imaginary solution from the user, but there might be a **better** one. If you can understand the problem and use case better, you might be able to suggest a better **alternative solution**.

* If you can't understand the question, ask for more **details**.

### Reproduce the problem

For most of the cases and most of the questions there's something related to the person's **original code**.

In many cases they will only copy a fragment of the code, but that's not enough to **reproduce the problem**.

* You can ask them to provide a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example" class="external-link" target="_blank">minimal, reproducible, example</a>, that you can **copy-paste** and run locally to see the same error or behavior they are seeing, or to understand their use case better.

* If you are feeling too generous, you can try to **create an example** like that yourself, just based on the description of the problem. Just keep in mind that this might take a lot of time and it might be better to ask them to clarify the problem first.

### Suggest solutions

* After being able to understand the question, you can give them a possible **answer**.

* In many cases, it's better to understand their **underlying problem or use case**, because there might be a better way to solve it than what they are trying to do.

### Ask to close

If they reply, there's a high chance you would have solved their problem, congrats, **you're a hero**! 🦸

* Now, if that solved their problem, you can ask them to:

    * In GitHub Discussions: mark the comment as the **answer**.
    * In GitHub Issues: **close** the issue.

## Watch the GitHub repository

You can "watch" FastAPI in GitHub (clicking the "watch" button at the top right): <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi</a>. 👀

If you select "Watching" instead of "Releases only" you will receive notifications when someone creates a new issue or question. You can also specify that you only want to be notified about new issues, or discussions, or PRs, etc.

Then you can try and help them solve those questions.

## Ask Questions

You can <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/discussions/new?category=questions" class="external-link" target="_blank">create a new question</a> in the GitHub repository, for example to:

* Ask a **question** or ask about a **problem**.
* Suggest a new **feature**.

**Note**: if you do it, then I'm going to ask you to also help others. 😉

## Review Pull Requests

You can help me review pull requests from others.

Again, please try your best to be kind. 🤗

---

Here's what to keep in mind and how to review a pull request:

### Understand the problem

* First, make sure you **understand the problem** that the pull request is trying to solve. It might have a longer discussion in a GitHub Discussion or issue.

* There's also a good chance that the pull request is not actually needed because the problem can be solved in a **different way**. Then you can suggest or ask about that.

### Don't worry about style

* Don't worry too much about things like commit message styles, I will squash and merge customizing the commit manually.

* Also don't worry about style rules, there are already automatized tools checking that.

And if there's any other style or consistency need, I'll ask directly for that, or I'll add commits on top with the needed changes.

### Check the code

* Check and read the code, see if it makes sense, **run it locally** and see if it actually solves the problem.

* Then **comment** saying that you did that, that's how I will know you really checked it.

/// info

Unfortunately, I can't simply trust PRs that just have several approvals.

Several times it has happened that there are PRs with 3, 5 or more approvals, probably because the description is appealing, but when I check the PRs, they are actually broken, have a bug, or don't solve the problem they claim to solve. 😅

So, it's really important that you actually read and run the code, and let me know in the comments that you did. 🤓

///

* If the PR can be simplified in a way, you can ask for that, but there's no need to be too picky, there might be a lot of subjective points of view (and I will have my own as well 🙈), so it's better if you can focus on the fundamental things.

### Tests

* Help me check that the PR has **tests**.

* Check that the tests **fail** before the PR. 🚨

* Then check that the tests **pass** after the PR. ✅

* Many PRs don't have tests, you can **remind** them to add tests, or you can even **suggest** some tests yourself. That's one of the things that consume most time and you can help a lot with that.

* Then also comment what you tried, that way I'll know that you checked it. 🤓

## Create a Pull Request

You can [contribute](contributing.md){.internal-link target=_blank} to the source code with Pull Requests, for example:

* To fix a typo you found on the documentation.
* To share an article, video, or podcast you created or found about FastAPI by <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/edit/master/docs/en/data/external_links.yml" class="external-link" target="_blank">editing this file</a>.
    * Make sure you add your link to the start of the corresponding section.
* To help [translate the documentation](contributing.md#translations){.internal-link target=_blank} to your language.
    * You can also help to review the translations created by others.
* To propose new documentation sections.
* To fix an existing issue/bug.
    * Make sure to add tests.
* To add a new feature.
    * Make sure to add tests.
    * Make sure to add documentation if it's relevant.

## Help Maintain FastAPI

Help me maintain **FastAPI**! 🤓

There's a lot of work to do, and for most of it, **YOU** can do it.

The main tasks that you can do right now are:

* [Help others with questions in GitHub](#help-others-with-questions-in-github){.internal-link target=_blank} (see the section above).
* [Review Pull Requests](#review-pull-requests){.internal-link target=_blank} (see the section above).

Those two tasks are what **consume time the most**. That's the main work of maintaining FastAPI.

If you can help me with that, **you are helping me maintain FastAPI** and making sure it keeps **advancing faster and better**. 🚀

## Join the chat

Join the 👥 <a href="https://discord.gg/VQjSZaeJmf" class="external-link" target="_blank">Discord chat server</a> 👥 and hang out with others in the FastAPI community.

/// tip

For questions, ask them in <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/discussions/new?category=questions" class="external-link" target="_blank">GitHub Discussions</a>, there's a much better chance you will receive help by the [FastAPI Experts](fastapi-people.md#fastapi-experts){.internal-link target=_blank}.

Use the chat only for other general conversations.

///

### Don't use the chat for questions

Keep in mind that as chats allow more "free conversation", it's easy to ask questions that are too general and more difficult to answer, so, you might not receive answers.

In GitHub, the template will guide you to write the right question so that you can more easily get a good answer, or even solve the problem yourself even before asking. And in GitHub I can make sure I always answer everything, even if it takes some time. I can't personally do that with the chat systems. 😅

Conversations in the chat systems are also not as easily searchable as in GitHub, so questions and answers might get lost in the conversation. And only the ones in GitHub count to become a [FastAPI Expert](fastapi-people.md#fastapi-experts){.internal-link target=_blank}, so you will most probably receive more attention in GitHub.

On the other side, there are thousands of users in the chat systems, so there's a high chance you'll find someone to talk to there, almost all the time. 😄

## Sponsor the author

If your **product/company** depends on or is related to **FastAPI** and you want to reach its users, you can sponsor the author (me) through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/tiangolo" class="external-link" target="_blank">GitHub sponsors</a>. Depending on the tier, you could get some extra benefits, like a badge in the docs. 🎁

# History, Design and Future

Some time ago, <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/issues/3#issuecomment-454956920" class="external-link" target="_blank">a **FastAPI** user asked</a>:

> What’s the history of this project? It seems to have come from nowhere to awesome in a few weeks [...]

Here's a little bit of that history.

## Alternatives

I have been creating APIs with complex requirements for several years (Machine Learning, distributed systems, asynchronous jobs, NoSQL databases, etc), leading several teams of developers.

As part of that, I needed to investigate, test and use many alternatives.

The history of **FastAPI** is in great part the history of its predecessors.

As said in the section [Alternatives](alternatives.md){.internal-link target=_blank}:

<blockquote markdown="1">

**FastAPI** wouldn't exist if not for the previous work of others.

There have been many tools created before that have helped inspire its creation.

I have been avoiding the creation of a new framework for several years. First I tried to solve all the features covered by **FastAPI** using many different frameworks, plug-ins, and tools.

But at some point, there was no other option than creating something that provided all these features, taking the best ideas from previous tools, and combining them in the best way possible, using language features that weren't even available before (Python 3.6+ type hints).

</blockquote>

## Investigation

By using all the previous alternatives I had the chance to learn from all of them, take ideas, and combine them in the best way I could find for myself and the teams of developers I have worked with.

For example, it was clear that ideally it should be based on standard Python type hints.

Also, the best approach was to use already existing standards.

So, before even starting to code **FastAPI**, I spent several months studying the specs for OpenAPI, JSON Schema, OAuth2, etc. Understanding their relationship, overlap, and differences.

## Design

Then I spent some time designing the developer "API" I wanted to have as a user (as a developer using FastAPI).

I tested several ideas in the most popular Python editors: PyCharm, VS Code, Jedi based editors.

By the last <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/#development-tools" class="external-link" target="_blank">Python Developer Survey</a>, that covers about 80% of the users.

It means that **FastAPI** was specifically tested with the editors used by 80% of the Python developers. And as most of the other editors tend to work similarly, all its benefits should work for virtually all editors.

That way I could find the best ways to reduce code duplication as much as possible, to have completion everywhere, type and error checks, etc.

All in a way that provided the best development experience for all the developers.

## Requirements

After testing several alternatives, I decided that I was going to use <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank">**Pydantic**</a> for its advantages.

Then I contributed to it, to make it fully compliant with JSON Schema, to support different ways to define constraint declarations, and to improve editor support (type checks, autocompletion) based on the tests in several editors.

During the development, I also contributed to <a href="https://www.starlette.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank">**Starlette**</a>, the other key requirement.

## Development

By the time I started creating **FastAPI** itself, most of the pieces were already in place, the design was defined, the requirements and tools were ready, and the knowledge about the standards and specifications was clear and fresh.

## Future

By this point, it's already clear that **FastAPI** with its ideas is being useful for many people.

It is being chosen over previous alternatives for suiting many use cases better.

Many developers and teams already depend on **FastAPI** for their projects (including me and my team).

But still, there are many improvements and features to come.

**FastAPI** has a great future ahead.

And [your help](help-fastapi.md){.internal-link target=_blank} is greatly appreciated.

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

* **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go** (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). [One of the fastest Python frameworks available](#performance).
* **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
* **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
* **Intuitive**: Great editor support. <abbr title="also known as auto-complete, autocompletion, IntelliSense">Completion</abbr> everywhere. Less time debugging.
* **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
* **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
* **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
* **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification" class="external-link" target="_blank">OpenAPI</a> (previously known as Swagger) and <a href="https://json-schema.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">JSON Schema</a>.

**Typer** is FastAPI's little sibling. And it's intended to be the **FastAPI of CLIs**. ⌨️ 🚀

## Requirements

FastAPI stands on the shoulders of giants:

* <a href="https://www.starlette.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Starlette</a> for the web parts.
* <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic</a> for the data parts.

## Installation

Create and activate a <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/virtual-environments/" class="external-link" target="_blank">virtual environment</a> and then install FastAPI:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install "fastapi[standard]"

---> 100%
```

</div>

**Note**: Make sure you put `"fastapi[standard]"` in quotes to ensure it works in all terminals.

## Example

### Create it

Create a file `main.py` with:

```Python
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Or use <code>async def</code>...</summary>

If your code uses `async` / `await`, use `async def`:

```Python hl_lines="9  14"
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

**Note**:

If you don't know, check the _"In a hurry?"_ section about <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/#in-a-hurry" target="_blank">`async` and `await` in the docs</a>.

</details>

### Run it

Run the server with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ fastapi dev main.py

<details markdown="1">
<summary>About the command <code>fastapi dev main.py</code>...</summary>

The command `fastapi dev` reads your `main.py` file, detects the **FastAPI** app in it, and starts a server using <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org" class="external-link" target="_blank">Uvicorn</a>.

By default, `fastapi dev` will start with auto-reload enabled for local development.

You can read more about it in the <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-cli/" target="_blank">FastAPI CLI docs</a>.

</details>

### Check it

Open your browser at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery</a>.

You will see the JSON response as:

```JSON
{"item_id": 5, "q": "somequery"}
```

You already created an API that:

* Receives HTTP requests in the _paths_ `/` and `/items/{item_id}`.
* Both _paths_ take `GET` <em>operations</em> (also known as HTTP _methods_).
* The _path_ `/items/{item_id}` has a _path parameter_ `item_id` that should be an `int`.
* The _path_ `/items/{item_id}` has an optional `str` _query parameter_ `q`.

### Interactive API docs

Now go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>.

You will see the automatic interactive API documentation (provided by <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui" class="external-link" target="_blank">Swagger UI</a>):

![Swagger UI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-01-swagger-ui-simple.png)

### Alternative API docs

And now, go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc</a>.

You will see the alternative automatic documentation (provided by <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc" class="external-link" target="_blank">ReDoc</a>):

![ReDoc](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-02-redoc-simple.png)

## Example upgrade

Now modify the file `main.py` to receive a body from a `PUT` request.

Declare the body using standard Python types, thanks to Pydantic.

```Python hl_lines="4  9-12  25-27"
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
    is_offer: Union[bool, None] = None


@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}


@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    return {"item_name": item.name, "item_id": item_id}
```

The `fastapi dev` server should reload automatically.

### Interactive API docs upgrade

Now go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>.

* The interactive API documentation will be automatically updated, including the new body:

![Swagger UI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-03-swagger-02.png)

* Click on the button "Try it out", it allows you to fill the parameters and directly interact with the API:

![Swagger UI interaction](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-04-swagger-03.png)

* Then click on the "Execute" button, the user interface will communicate with your API, send the parameters, get the results and show them on the screen:

![Swagger UI interaction](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-05-swagger-04.png)

### Alternative API docs upgrade

And now, go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc</a>.

* The alternative documentation will also reflect the new query parameter and body:

![ReDoc](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-06-redoc-02.png)

### Recap

In summary, you declare **once** the types of parameters, body, etc. as function parameters.

You do that with standard modern Python types.

You don't have to learn a new syntax, the methods or classes of a specific library, etc.

Just standard **Python**.

For example, for an `int`:

```Python
item_id: int
```

or for a more complex `Item` model:

```Python
item: Item
```

...and with that single declaration you get:

* Editor support, including:
    * Completion.
    * Type checks.
* Validation of data:
    * Automatic and clear errors when the data is invalid.
    * Validation even for deeply nested JSON objects.
* <abbr title="also known as: serialization, parsing, marshalling">Conversion</abbr> of input data: coming from the network to Python data and types. Reading from:
    * JSON.
    * Path parameters.
    * Query parameters.
    * Cookies.
    * Headers.
    * Forms.
    * Files.
* <abbr title="also known as: serialization, parsing, marshalling">Conversion</abbr> of output data: converting from Python data and types to network data (as JSON):
    * Convert Python types (`str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, etc).
    * `datetime` objects.
    * `UUID` objects.
    * Database models.
    * ...and many more.
* Automatic interactive API documentation, including 2 alternative user interfaces:
    * Swagger UI.
    * ReDoc.

---

Coming back to the previous code example, **FastAPI** will:

* Validate that there is an `item_id` in the path for `GET` and `PUT` requests.
* Validate that the `item_id` is of type `int` for `GET` and `PUT` requests.
    * If it is not, the client will see a useful, clear error.
* Check if there is an optional query parameter named `q` (as in `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?q=somequery`) for `GET` requests.
    * As the `q` parameter is declared with `= None`, it is optional.
    * Without the `None` it would be required (as is the body in the case with `PUT`).
* For `PUT` requests to `/items/{item_id}`, read the body as JSON:
    * Check that it has a required attribute `name` that should be a `str`.
    * Check that it has a required attribute `price` that has to be a `float`.
    * Check that it has an optional attribute `is_offer`, that should be a `bool`, if present.
    * All this would also work for deeply nested JSON objects.
* Convert from and to JSON automatically.
* Document everything with OpenAPI, that can be used by:
    * Interactive documentation systems.
    * Automatic client code generation systems, for many languages.
* Provide 2 interactive documentation web interfaces directly.

---

We just scratched the surface, but you already get the idea of how it all works.

Try changing the line with:

```Python
    return {"item_name": item.name, "item_id": item_id}
```

...from:

```Python
        ... "item_name": item.name ...
```

...to:

```Python
        ... "item_price": item.price ...
```

...and see how your editor will auto-complete the attributes and know their types:

![editor support](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/vscode-completion.png)

For a more complete example including more features, see the <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/">Tutorial - User Guide</a>.

**Spoiler alert**: the tutorial - user guide includes:

* Declaration of **parameters** from other different places as: **headers**, **cookies**, **form fields** and **files**.
* How to set **validation constraints** as `maximum_length` or `regex`.
* A very powerful and easy to use **<abbr title="also known as components, resources, providers, services, injectables">Dependency Injection</abbr>** system.
* Security and authentication, including support for **OAuth2** with **JWT tokens** and **HTTP Basic** auth.
* More advanced (but equally easy) techniques for declaring **deeply nested JSON models** (thanks to Pydantic).
* **GraphQL** integration with <a href="https://strawberry.rocks" class="external-link" target="_blank">Strawberry</a> and other libraries.
* Many extra features (thanks to Starlette) as:
    * **WebSockets**
    * extremely easy tests based on HTTPX and `pytest`
    * **CORS**
    * **Cookie Sessions**
    * ...and more.

## Performance

Independent TechEmpower benchmarks show **FastAPI** applications running under Uvicorn as <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=test&runid=7464e520-0dc2-473d-bd34-dbdfd7e85911&hw=ph&test=query&l=zijzen-7" class="external-link" target="_blank">one of the fastest Python frameworks available</a>, only below Starlette and Uvicorn themselves (used internally by FastAPI). (*)

To understand more about it, see the section <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/benchmarks/" class="internal-link" target="_blank">Benchmarks</a>.

## Dependencies

FastAPI depends on Pydantic and Starlette.

### `standard` Dependencies

When you install FastAPI with `pip install "fastapi[standard]"` it comes with the `standard` group of optional dependencies:

Used by Pydantic:

* <a href="https://github.com/JoshData/python-email-validator" target="_blank"><code>email-validator</code></a> - for email validation.

Used by Starlette:

* <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org" target="_blank"><code>httpx</code></a> - Required if you want to use the `TestClient`.
* <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com" target="_blank"><code>jinja2</code></a> - Required if you want to use the default template configuration.
* <a href="https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart" target="_blank"><code>python-multipart</code></a> - Required if you want to support form <abbr title="converting the string that comes from an HTTP request into Python data">"parsing"</abbr>, with `request.form()`.

Used by FastAPI / Starlette:

* <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org" target="_blank"><code>uvicorn</code></a> - for the server that loads and serves your application. This includes `uvicorn[standard]`, which includes some dependencies (e.g. `uvloop`) needed for high performance serving.
* `fastapi-cli` - to provide the `fastapi` command.

### Without `standard` Dependencies

If you don't want to include the `standard` optional dependencies, you can install with `pip install fastapi` instead of `pip install "fastapi[standard]"`.

### Additional Optional Dependencies

There are some additional dependencies you might want to install.

Additional optional Pydantic dependencies:

* <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/pydantic_settings/" target="_blank"><code>pydantic-settings</code></a> - for settings management.
* <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/types/extra_types/extra_types/" target="_blank"><code>pydantic-extra-types</code></a> - for extra types to be used with Pydantic.

Additional optional FastAPI dependencies:

* <a href="https://github.com/ijl/orjson" target="_blank"><code>orjson</code></a> - Required if you want to use `ORJSONResponse`.
* <a href="https://github.com/esnme/ultrajson" target="_blank"><code>ujson</code></a> - Required if you want to use `UJSONResponse`.

# Repository Management Tasks

These are the tasks that can be performed to manage the FastAPI repository by [team members](./fastapi-people.md#team){.internal-link target=_blank}.

/// tip

This section is useful only to a handful of people, team members with permissions to manage the repository. You can probably skip it. 😉

///

...so, you are a [team member of FastAPI](./fastapi-people.md#team){.internal-link target=_blank}? Wow, you are so cool! 😎

You can help with everything on [Help FastAPI - Get Help](./help-fastapi.md){.internal-link target=_blank} the same ways as external contributors. But additionally, there are some tasks that only you (as part of the team) can perform.

Here are the general instructions for the tasks you can perform.

Thanks a lot for your help. 🙇

## Be Nice

First of all, be nice. 😊

You probably are super nice if you were added to the team, but it's worth mentioning it. 🤓

### When Things are Difficult

When things are great, everything is easier, so that doesn't need much instructions. But when things are difficult, here are some guidelines.

Try to find the good side. In general, if people are not being unfriendly, try to thank their effort and interest, even if you disagree with the main subject (discussion, PR), just thank them for being interested in the project, or for having dedicated some time to try to do something.

It's difficult to convey emotion in text, use emojis to help. 😅

In discussions and PRs, in many cases, people bring their frustration and show it without filter, in many cases exaggerating, complaining, being entitled, etc. That's really not nice, and when it happens, it lowers our priority to solve their problems. But still, try to breath, and be gentle with your answers.

Try to avoid using bitter sarcasm or potentially passive-aggressive comments. If something is wrong, it's better to be direct (try to be gentle) than sarcastic.

Try to be as specific and objective as possible, avoid generalizations.

For conversations that are more difficult, for example to reject a PR, you can ask me (@tiangolo) to handle it directly.

## Edit PR Titles

* Edit the PR title to start with an emoji from <a href="https://gitmoji.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank">gitmoji</a>.
    * Use the emoji character, not the GitHub code. So, use `🐛` instead of `:bug:`. This is so that it shows up correctly outside of GitHub, for example in the release notes.
    * For translations use the `🌐` emoji ("globe with meridians").
* Start the title with a verb. For example `Add`, `Refactor`, `Fix`, etc. This way the title will say the action that the PR does. Like `Add support for teleporting`, instead of `Teleporting wasn't working, so this PR fixes it`.
* Edit the text of the PR title to start in "imperative", like giving an order. So, instead of `Adding support for teleporting` use `Add support for teleporting`.
* Try to make the title descriptive about what it achieves. If it's a feature, try to describe it, for example `Add support for teleporting` instead of `Create TeleportAdapter class`.
* Do not finish the title with a period (`.`).
* When the PR is for a translation, start with the `🌐` and then `Add {language} translation for` and then the translated file path. For example:

```Markdown
🌐 Add Spanish translation for `docs/es/docs/teleporting.md`
```

Once the PR is merged, a GitHub Action (<a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/latest-changes" class="external-link" target="_blank">latest-changes</a>) will use the PR title to update the latest changes automatically.

So, having a nice PR title will not only look nice in GitHub, but also in the release notes. 📝

## Add Labels to PRs

The same GitHub Action <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/latest-changes" class="external-link" target="_blank">latest-changes</a> uses one label in the PR to decide the section in the release notes to put this PR in.

Make sure you use a supported label from the <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/latest-changes#using-labels" class="external-link" target="_blank">latest-changes list of labels</a>:

* `breaking`: Breaking Changes
    * Existing code will break if they update the version without changing their code. This rarely happens, so this label is not frequently used.
* `security`: Security Fixes
    * This is for security fixes, like vulnerabilities. It would almost never be used.
* `feature`: Features
    * New features, adding support for things that didn't exist before.
* `bug`: Fixes
    * Something that was supported didn't work, and this fixes it. There are many PRs that claim to be bug fixes because the user is doing something in an unexpected way that is not supported, but they considered it what should be supported by default. Many of these are actually features or refactors. But in some cases there's an actual bug.
* `refactor`: Refactors
    * This is normally for changes to the internal code that don't change the behavior. Normally it improves maintainability, or enables future features, etc.
* `upgrade`: Upgrades
    * This is for upgrades to direct dependencies from the project, or extra optional dependencies, normally in `pyproject.toml`. So, things that would affect final users, they would end up receiving the upgrade in their code base once they update. But this is not for upgrades to internal dependencies used for development, testing, docs, etc. Those internal dependencies, normally in `requirements.txt` files or GitHub Action versions should be marked as `internal`, not `upgrade`.
* `docs`: Docs
    * Changes in docs. This includes updating the docs, fixing typos. But it doesn't include changes to translations.
    * You can normally quickly detect it by going to the "Files changed" tab in the PR and checking if the updated file(s) starts with `docs/en/docs`. The original version of the docs is always in English, so in `docs/en/docs`.
* `lang-all`: Translations
    * Use this for translations. You can normally quickly detect it by going to the "Files changed" tab in the PR and checking if the updated file(s) starts with `docs/{some lang}/docs` but not `docs/en/docs`. For example, `docs/es/docs`.
* `internal`: Internal
    * Use this for changes that only affect how the repo is managed. For example upgrades to internal dependencies, changes in GitHub Actions or scripts, etc.

/// tip

Some tools like Dependabot, will add some labels, like `dependencies`, but have in mind that this label is not used by the `latest-changes` GitHub Action, so it won't be used in the release notes. Please make sure one of the labels above is added.

///

## Add Labels to Translation PRs

When there's a PR for a translation, apart from adding the `lang-all` label, also add a label for the language.

There will be a label for each language using the language code, like `lang-{lang code}`, for example, `lang-es` for Spanish, `lang-fr` for French, etc.

* Add the specific language label.
* Add the label `awaiting-review`.

The label `awaiting-review` is special, only used for translations. A GitHub Action will detect it, then it will read the language label, and it will update the GitHub Discussions managing the translations for that language to notify people that there's a new translation to review.

Once a native speaker comes, reviews the PR, and approves it, the GitHub Action will come and remove the `awaiting-review` label, and add the `approved-1` label.

This way, we can notice when there are new translations ready, because they have the `approved-1` label.

## Merge Translation PRs

For Spanish, as I'm a native speaker and it's a language close to me, I will give it a final review myself and in most cases tweak the PR a bit before merging it.

For the other languages, confirm that:

* The title is correct following the instructions above.
* It has the labels `lang-all` and `lang-{lang code}`.
* The PR changes only one Markdown file adding a translation.
    * Or in some cases, at most two files, if they are small, for the same language, and people reviewed them.
    * If it's the first translation for that language, it will have additional `mkdocs.yml` files, for those cases follow the instructions below.
* The PR doesn't add any additional or extraneous files.
* The translation seems to have a similar structure as the original English file.
* The translation doesn't seem to change the original content, for example with obvious additional documentation sections.
* The translation doesn't use different Markdown structures, for example adding HTML tags when the original didn't have them.
* The "admonition" sections, like `tip`, `info`, etc. are not changed or translated. For example:

```
/// tip

This is a tip.

///

```

looks like this:

/// tip

This is a tip.

///

...it could be translated as:

```
/// tip

Esto es un consejo.

///

```

...but needs to keep the exact `tip` keyword. If it was translated to `consejo`, like:

```
/// consejo

Esto es un consejo.

///

```

it would change the style to the default one, it would look like:

/// consejo

Esto es un consejo.

///

Those don't have to be translated, but if they are, they need to be written as:

```
/// tip | consejo

Esto es un consejo.

///

```

Which looks like:

/// tip | consejo

Esto es un consejo.

///

## First Translation PR

When there's a first translation for a language, it will have a `docs/{lang code}/docs/index.md` translated file and a `docs/{lang code}/mkdocs.yml`.

For example, for Bosnian, it would be:

* `docs/bs/docs/index.md`
* `docs/bs/mkdocs.yml`

The `mkdocs.yml` file will have only the following content:

```YAML
INHERIT: ../en/mkdocs.yml
```

The language code would normally be in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes" class="external-link" target="_blank">ISO 639-1 list of language codes</a>.

In any case, the language code should be in the file <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/blob/master/docs/language_names.yml" class="external-link" target="_blank">docs/language_names.yml</a>.

There won't be yet a label for the language code, for example, if it was Bosnian, there wouldn't be a `lang-bs`. Before creating the label and adding it to the PR, create the GitHub Discussion:

* Go to the <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/discussions/categories/translations" class="external-link" target="_blank">Translations GitHub Discussions</a>
* Create a new discussion with the title `Bosnian Translations` (or the language name in English)
* A description of:

```Markdown
## Bosnian translations

This is the issue to track translations of the docs to Bosnian. 🚀

Here are the [PRs to review with the label `lang-bs`](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Alang-bs+label%3A%22awaiting-review%22). 🤓
```

Update "Bosnian" with the new language.

And update the search link to point to the new language label that will be created, like `lang-bs`.

Create and add the label to that new Discussion just created, like `lang-bs`.

Then go back to the PR, and add the label, like `lang-bs`, and `lang-all` and `awaiting-review`.

Now the GitHub action will automatically detect the label `lang-bs` and will post in that Discussion that this PR is waiting to be reviewed.

## Review PRs

If a PR doesn't explain what it does or why, ask for more information.

A PR should have a specific use case that it is solving.

* If the PR is for a feature, it should have docs.
    * Unless it's a feature we want to discourage, like support for a corner case that we don't want users to use.
* The docs should include a source example file, not write Python directly in Markdown.
* If the source example(s) file can have different syntax for Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, there should be different versions of the file, and they should be shown in tabs in the docs.
* There should be tests testing the source example.
* Before the PR is applied, the new tests should fail.
* After applying the PR, the new tests should pass.
* Coverage should stay at 100%.
* If you see the PR makes sense, or we discussed it and considered it should be accepted, you can add commits on top of the PR to tweak it, to add docs, tests, format, refactor, remove extra files, etc.
* Feel free to comment in the PR to ask for more information, to suggest changes, etc.
* Once you think the PR is ready, move it in the internal GitHub project for me to review it.

## FastAPI People PRs

Every month, a GitHub Action updates the FastAPI People data. Those PRs look like this one: <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/pull/11669" class="external-link" target="_blank">👥 Update FastAPI People</a>.

If the tests are passing, you can merge it right away.

## External Links PRs

When people add external links they edit this file <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/blob/master/docs/en/data/external_links.yml" class="external-link" target="_blank">external_links.yml</a>.

* Make sure the new link is in the correct category (e.g. "Podcasts") and language (e.g. "Japanese").
* A new link should be at the top of its list.
* The link URL should work (it should not return a 404).
* The content of the link should be about FastAPI.
* The new addition should have these fields:
    * `author`: The name of the author.
    * `link`: The URL with the content.
    * `title`: The title of the link (the title of the article, podcast, etc).

After checking all these things and ensuring the PR has the right labels, you can merge it.

## Dependabot PRs

Dependabot will create PRs to update dependencies for several things, and those PRs all look similar, but some are way more delicate than others.

* If the PR is for a direct dependency, so, Dependabot is modifying `pyproject.toml`, **don't merge it**. 😱 Let me check it first. There's a good chance that some additional tweaks or updates are needed.
* If the PR updates one of the internal dependencies, for example it's modifying `requirements.txt` files, or GitHub Action versions, if the tests are passing, the release notes (shown in a summary in the PR) don't show any obvious potential breaking change, you can merge it. 😎

# Python Types Intro

Python has support for optional "type hints" (also called "type annotations").

These **"type hints"** or annotations are a special syntax that allow declaring the <abbr title="for example: str, int, float, bool">type</abbr> of a variable.

By declaring types for your variables, editors and tools can give you better support.

This is just a **quick tutorial / refresher** about Python type hints. It covers only the minimum necessary to use them with **FastAPI**... which is actually very little.

**FastAPI** is all based on these type hints, they give it many advantages and benefits.

But even if you never use **FastAPI**, you would benefit from learning a bit about them.

/// note

If you are a Python expert, and you already know everything about type hints, skip to the next chapter.

///

## Motivation

Let's start with a simple example:

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial001.py *}

Calling this program outputs:

```
John Doe
```

The function does the following:

* Takes a `first_name` and `last_name`.
* Converts the first letter of each one to upper case with `title()`.
* <abbr title="Puts them together, as one. With the contents of one after the other.">Concatenates</abbr> them with a space in the middle.

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial001.py hl[2] *}

### Edit it

It's a very simple program.

But now imagine that you were writing it from scratch.

At some point you would have started the definition of the function, you had the parameters ready...

But then you have to call "that method that converts the first letter to upper case".

Was it `upper`? Was it `uppercase`? `first_uppercase`? `capitalize`?

Then, you try with the old programmer's friend, editor autocompletion.

You type the first parameter of the function, `first_name`, then a dot (`.`) and then hit `Ctrl+Space` to trigger the completion.

But, sadly, you get nothing useful:

<img src="/img/python-types/image01.png">

### Add types

Let's modify a single line from the previous version.

We will change exactly this fragment, the parameters of the function, from:

```Python
    first_name, last_name
```

to:

```Python
    first_name: str, last_name: str
```

That's it.

Those are the "type hints":

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial002.py hl[1] *}

That is not the same as declaring default values like would be with:

```Python
    first_name="john", last_name="doe"
```

It's a different thing.

We are using colons (`:`), not equals (`=`).

And adding type hints normally doesn't change what happens from what would happen without them.

But now, imagine you are again in the middle of creating that function, but with type hints.

At the same point, you try to trigger the autocomplete with `Ctrl+Space` and you see:

<img src="/img/python-types/image02.png">

With that, you can scroll, seeing the options, until you find the one that "rings a bell":

<img src="/img/python-types/image03.png">

## More motivation

Check this function, it already has type hints:

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial003.py hl[1] *}

Because the editor knows the types of the variables, you don't only get completion, you also get error checks:

<img src="/img/python-types/image04.png">

Now you know that you have to fix it, convert `age` to a string with `str(age)`:

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial004.py hl[2] *}

## Declaring types

You just saw the main place to declare type hints. As function parameters.

This is also the main place you would use them with **FastAPI**.

### Simple types

You can declare all the standard Python types, not only `str`.

You can use, for example:

* `int`
* `float`
* `bool`
* `bytes`

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial005.py hl[1] *}

### Generic types with type parameters

There are some data structures that can contain other values, like `dict`, `list`, `set` and `tuple`. And the internal values can have their own type too.

These types that have internal types are called "**generic**" types. And it's possible to declare them, even with their internal types.

To declare those types and the internal types, you can use the standard Python module `typing`. It exists specifically to support these type hints.

#### Newer versions of Python

The syntax using `typing` is **compatible** with all versions, from Python 3.6 to the latest ones, including Python 3.9, Python 3.10, etc.

As Python advances, **newer versions** come with improved support for these type annotations and in many cases you won't even need to import and use the `typing` module to declare the type annotations.

If you can choose a more recent version of Python for your project, you will be able to take advantage of that extra simplicity.

In all the docs there are examples compatible with each version of Python (when there's a difference).

For example "**Python 3.6+**" means it's compatible with Python 3.6 or above (including 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, etc). And "**Python 3.9+**" means it's compatible with Python 3.9 or above (including 3.10, etc).

If you can use the **latest versions of Python**, use the examples for the latest version, those will have the **best and simplest syntax**, for example, "**Python 3.10+**".

#### List

For example, let's define a variable to be a `list` of `str`.

//// tab | Python 3.9+

Declare the variable, with the same colon (`:`) syntax.

As the type, put `list`.

As the list is a type that contains some internal types, you put them in square brackets:

```Python hl_lines="1"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial006_py39.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+

From `typing`, import `List` (with a capital `L`):

```Python hl_lines="1"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial006.py!}
```

Declare the variable, with the same colon (`:`) syntax.

As the type, put the `List` that you imported from `typing`.

As the list is a type that contains some internal types, you put them in square brackets:

```Python hl_lines="4"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial006.py!}
```

////

/// info

Those internal types in the square brackets are called "type parameters".

In this case, `str` is the type parameter passed to `List` (or `list` in Python 3.9 and above).

///

That means: "the variable `items` is a `list`, and each of the items in this list is a `str`".

/// tip

If you use Python 3.9 or above, you don't have to import `List` from `typing`, you can use the same regular `list` type instead.

///

By doing that, your editor can provide support even while processing items from the list:

<img src="/img/python-types/image05.png">

Without types, that's almost impossible to achieve.

Notice that the variable `item` is one of the elements in the list `items`.

And still, the editor knows it is a `str`, and provides support for that.

#### Tuple and Set

You would do the same to declare `tuple`s and `set`s:

//// tab | Python 3.9+

```Python hl_lines="1"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial007_py39.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python hl_lines="1  4"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial007.py!}
```

////

This means:

* The variable `items_t` is a `tuple` with 3 items, an `int`, another `int`, and a `str`.
* The variable `items_s` is a `set`, and each of its items is of type `bytes`.

#### Dict

To define a `dict`, you pass 2 type parameters, separated by commas.

The first type parameter is for the keys of the `dict`.

The second type parameter is for the values of the `dict`:

//// tab | Python 3.9+

```Python hl_lines="1"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial008_py39.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python hl_lines="1  4"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial008.py!}
```

////

This means:

* The variable `prices` is a `dict`:
    * The keys of this `dict` are of type `str` (let's say, the name of each item).
    * The values of this `dict` are of type `float` (let's say, the price of each item).

#### Union

You can declare that a variable can be any of **several types**, for example, an `int` or a `str`.

In Python 3.6 and above (including Python 3.10) you can use the `Union` type from `typing` and put inside the square brackets the possible types to accept.

In Python 3.10 there's also a **new syntax** where you can put the possible types separated by a <abbr title='also called "bitwise or operator", but that meaning is not relevant here'>vertical bar (`|`)</abbr>.

//// tab | Python 3.10+

```Python hl_lines="1"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial008b_py310.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python hl_lines="1  4"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial008b.py!}
```

////

In both cases this means that `item` could be an `int` or a `str`.

#### Possibly `None`

You can declare that a value could have a type, like `str`, but that it could also be `None`.

In Python 3.6 and above (including Python 3.10) you can declare it by importing and using `Optional` from the `typing` module.

```Python hl_lines="1  4"
{!../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial009.py!}
```

Using `Optional[str]` instead of just `str` will let the editor help you detect errors where you could be assuming that a value is always a `str`, when it could actually be `None` too.

`Optional[Something]` is actually a shortcut for `Union[Something, None]`, they are equivalent.

This also means that in Python 3.10, you can use `Something | None`:

//// tab | Python 3.10+

```Python hl_lines="1"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial009_py310.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python hl_lines="1  4"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial009.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+ alternative

```Python hl_lines="1  4"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial009b.py!}
```

////

#### Using `Union` or `Optional`

If you are using a Python version below 3.10, here's a tip from my very **subjective** point of view:

* 🚨 Avoid using `Optional[SomeType]`
* Instead ✨ **use `Union[SomeType, None]`** ✨.

Both are equivalent and underneath they are the same, but I would recommend `Union` instead of `Optional` because the word "**optional**" would seem to imply that the value is optional, and it actually means "it can be `None`", even if it's not optional and is still required.

I think `Union[SomeType, None]` is more explicit about what it means.

It's just about the words and names. But those words can affect how you and your teammates think about the code.

As an example, let's take this function:

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial009c.py hl[1,4] *}

The parameter `name` is defined as `Optional[str]`, but it is **not optional**, you cannot call the function without the parameter:

```Python
say_hi()  # Oh, no, this throws an error! 😱
```

The `name` parameter is **still required** (not *optional*) because it doesn't have a default value. Still, `name` accepts `None` as the value:

```Python
say_hi(name=None)  # This works, None is valid 🎉
```

The good news is, once you are on Python 3.10 you won't have to worry about that, as you will be able to simply use `|` to define unions of types:

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial009c_py310.py hl[1,4] *}

And then you won't have to worry about names like `Optional` and `Union`. 😎

#### Generic types

These types that take type parameters in square brackets are called **Generic types** or **Generics**, for example:

//// tab | Python 3.10+

You can use the same builtin types as generics (with square brackets and types inside):

* `list`
* `tuple`
* `set`
* `dict`

And the same as with Python 3.8, from the `typing` module:

* `Union`
* `Optional` (the same as with Python 3.8)
* ...and others.

In Python 3.10, as an alternative to using the generics `Union` and `Optional`, you can use the <abbr title='also called "bitwise or operator", but that meaning is not relevant here'>vertical bar (`|`)</abbr> to declare unions of types, that's a lot better and simpler.

////

//// tab | Python 3.9+

You can use the same builtin types as generics (with square brackets and types inside):

* `list`
* `tuple`
* `set`
* `dict`

And the same as with Python 3.8, from the `typing` module:

* `Union`
* `Optional`
* ...and others.

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+

* `List`
* `Tuple`
* `Set`
* `Dict`
* `Union`
* `Optional`
* ...and others.

////

### Classes as types

You can also declare a class as the type of a variable.

Let's say you have a class `Person`, with a name:

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial010.py hl[1:3] *}

Then you can declare a variable to be of type `Person`:

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial010.py hl[6] *}

And then, again, you get all the editor support:

<img src="/img/python-types/image06.png">

Notice that this means "`one_person` is an **instance** of the class `Person`".

It doesn't mean "`one_person` is the **class** called `Person`".

## Pydantic models

<a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic</a> is a Python library to perform data validation.

You declare the "shape" of the data as classes with attributes.

And each attribute has a type.

Then you create an instance of that class with some values and it will validate the values, convert them to the appropriate type (if that's the case) and give you an object with all the data.

And you get all the editor support with that resulting object.

An example from the official Pydantic docs:

//// tab | Python 3.10+

```Python
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial011_py310.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.9+

```Python
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial011_py39.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial011.py!}
```

////

/// info

To learn more about <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic, check its docs</a>.

///

**FastAPI** is all based on Pydantic.

You will see a lot more of all this in practice in the [Tutorial - User Guide](tutorial/index.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

/// tip

Pydantic has a special behavior when you use `Optional` or `Union[Something, None]` without a default value, you can read more about it in the Pydantic docs about <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.3/usage/models/#required-fields" class="external-link" target="_blank">Required Optional fields</a>.

///

## Type Hints with Metadata Annotations

Python also has a feature that allows putting **additional <abbr title="Data about the data, in this case, information about the type, e.g. a description.">metadata</abbr>** in these type hints using `Annotated`.

//// tab | Python 3.9+

In Python 3.9, `Annotated` is part of the standard library, so you can import it from `typing`.

```Python hl_lines="1  4"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial013_py39.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+

In versions below Python 3.9, you import `Annotated` from `typing_extensions`.

It will already be installed with **FastAPI**.

```Python hl_lines="1  4"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial013.py!}
```

////

Python itself doesn't do anything with this `Annotated`. And for editors and other tools, the type is still `str`.

But you can use this space in `Annotated` to provide **FastAPI** with additional metadata about how you want your application to behave.

The important thing to remember is that **the first *type parameter*** you pass to `Annotated` is the **actual type**. The rest, is just metadata for other tools.

For now, you just need to know that `Annotated` exists, and that it's standard Python. 😎

Later you will see how **powerful** it can be.

/// tip

The fact that this is **standard Python** means that you will still get the **best possible developer experience** in your editor, with the tools you use to analyze and refactor your code, etc. ✨

And also that your code will be very compatible with many other Python tools and libraries. 🚀

///

## Type hints in **FastAPI**

**FastAPI** takes advantage of these type hints to do several things.

With **FastAPI** you declare parameters with type hints and you get:

* **Editor support**.
* **Type checks**.

...and **FastAPI** uses the same declarations to:

* **Define requirements**: from request path parameters, query parameters, headers, bodies, dependencies, etc.
* **Convert data**: from the request to the required type.
* **Validate data**: coming from each request:
    * Generating **automatic errors** returned to the client when the data is invalid.
* **Document** the API using OpenAPI:
    * which is then used by the automatic interactive documentation user interfaces.

This might all sound abstract. Don't worry. You'll see all this in action in the [Tutorial - User Guide](tutorial/index.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

The important thing is that by using standard Python types, in a single place (instead of adding more classes, decorators, etc), **FastAPI** will do a lot of the work for you.

/// info

If you already went through all the tutorial and came back to see more about types, a good resource is <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet_py3.html" class="external-link" target="_blank">the "cheat sheet" from `mypy`</a>.

## 0.115.0

### Highlights

Now you can declare `Query`, `Header`, and `Cookie` parameters with Pydantic models. 🎉

#### `Query` Parameter Models

Use Pydantic models for `Query` parameters:

```python
from typing import Annotated, Literal

from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

app = FastAPI()


class FilterParams(BaseModel):
    limit: int = Field(100, gt=0, le=100)
    offset: int = Field(0, ge=0)
    order_by: Literal["created_at", "updated_at"] = "created_at"
    tags: list[str] = []


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(filter_query: Annotated[FilterParams, Query()]):
    return filter_query
```

Read the new docs: [Query Parameter Models](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-param-models/).

#### `Header` Parameter Models

Use Pydantic models for `Header` parameters:

```python
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import FastAPI, Header
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class CommonHeaders(BaseModel):
    host: str
    save_data: bool
    if_modified_since: str | None = None
    traceparent: str | None = None
    x_tag: list[str] = []


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(headers: Annotated[CommonHeaders, Header()]):
    return headers
```

Read the new docs: [Header Parameter Models](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/header-param-models/).

#### `Cookie` Parameter Models

Use Pydantic models for `Cookie` parameters:

```python
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import Cookie, FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class Cookies(BaseModel):
    session_id: str
    fatebook_tracker: str | None = None
    googall_tracker: str | None = None


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(cookies: Annotated[Cookies, Cookie()]):
    return cookies
```

Read the new docs: [Cookie Parameter Models](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cookie-param-models/).

#### Forbid Extra Query (Cookie, Header) Parameters

Use Pydantic models to restrict extra values for `Query` parameters (also applies to `Header` and `Cookie` parameters).

To achieve it, use Pydantic's `model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}`:

```python
from typing import Annotated, Literal

from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

app = FastAPI()


class FilterParams(BaseModel):
    model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}

    limit: int = Field(100, gt=0, le=100)
    offset: int = Field(0, ge=0)
    order_by: Literal["created_at", "updated_at"] = "created_at"
    tags: list[str] = []


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(filter_query: Annotated[FilterParams, Query()]):
    return filter_query
```

This applies to `Query`, `Header`, and `Cookie` parameters, read the new docs:

* [Forbid Extra Query Parameters](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-param-models/#forbid-extra-query-parameters)
* [Forbid Extra Headers](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/header-param-models/#forbid-extra-headers)
* [Forbid Extra Cookies](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cookie-param-models/#forbid-extra-cookies)

## 0.114.0

You can restrict form fields to only include those declared in a Pydantic model and forbid any extra field sent in the request using Pydantic's `model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}`:

```python
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import FastAPI, Form
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class FormData(BaseModel):
    username: str
    password: str
    model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}


@app.post("/login/")
async def login(data: Annotated[FormData, Form()]):
    return data
```

Read the new docs: [Form Models - Forbid Extra Form Fields](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/request-form-models/#forbid-extra-form-fields).

### Features

## 0.112.0

### Breaking Changes

* ♻️ Add support for `pip install "fastapi[standard]"` with standard dependencies and `python -m fastapi`. PR [#11935](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/pull/11935) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

#### Summary

Install with:

```bash
pip install "fastapi[standard]"
```

#### Other Changes

* This adds support for calling the CLI as:

```bash
python -m fastapi
```

* And it upgrades `fastapi-cli[standard] >=0.0.5`.

#### Technical Details

Before this, `fastapi` would include the standard dependencies, with Uvicorn and the `fastapi-cli`, etc.

And `fastapi-slim` would not include those standard dependencies.

Now `fastapi` doesn't include those standard dependencies unless you install with `pip install "fastapi[standard]"`.

Before, you would install `pip install fastapi`, now you should include the `standard` optional dependencies (unless you want to exclude one of those): `pip install "fastapi[standard]"`.

This change is because having the standard optional dependencies installed by default was being inconvenient to several users, and having to install instead `fastapi-slim` was not being a feasible solution.

### Breaking Changes

* 🐛 Fix unhandled growing memory for internal server errors, refactor dependencies with `yield` and `except` to require raising again as in regular Python. PR [#11191](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/11191) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).
    * This is a breaking change (and only slightly) if you used dependencies with `yield`, used `except` in those dependencies, and didn't raise again.
    * This was reported internally by [@rushilsrivastava](https://github.com/rushilsrivastava) as a memory leak when the server had unhandled exceptions that would produce internal server errors, the memory allocated before that point would not be released.
    * Read the new docs: [Dependencies with `yield` and `except`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-with-yield/#dependencies-with-yield-and-except).

In short, if you had dependencies that looked like:

```Python
def my_dep():
    try:
        yield
    except SomeException:
        pass
```

Now you need to make sure you raise again after `except`, just as you would in regular Python:

```Python
def my_dep():
    try:
        yield
    except SomeException:
        raise
```

## 0.106.0

### Breaking Changes

Using resources from dependencies with `yield` in background tasks is no longer supported.

This change is what supports the new features, read below. 🤓

### Dependencies with `yield`, `HTTPException` and Background Tasks

Dependencies with `yield` now can raise `HTTPException` and other exceptions after `yield`. 🎉

Read the new docs here: [Dependencies with `yield` and `HTTPException`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-with-yield/#dependencies-with-yield-and-httpexception).

```Python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI, HTTPException
from typing_extensions import Annotated

app = FastAPI()


data = {
    "plumbus": {"description": "Freshly pickled plumbus", "owner": "Morty"},
    "portal-gun": {"description": "Gun to create portals", "owner": "Rick"},
}


class OwnerError(Exception):
    pass


def get_username():
    try:
        yield "Rick"
    except OwnerError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=f"Owner error: {e}")


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def get_item(item_id: str, username: Annotated[str, Depends(get_username)]):
    if item_id not in data:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
    item = data[item_id]
    if item["owner"] != username:
        raise OwnerError(username)
    return item
```

---

Before FastAPI 0.106.0, raising exceptions after `yield` was not possible, the exit code in dependencies with `yield` was executed *after* the response was sent, so [Exception Handlers](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/handling-errors/#install-custom-exception-handlers) would have already run.

This was designed this way mainly to allow using the same objects "yielded" by dependencies inside of background tasks, because the exit code would be executed after the background tasks were finished.

Nevertheless, as this would mean waiting for the response to travel through the network while unnecessarily holding a resource in a dependency with yield (for example a database connection), this was changed in FastAPI 0.106.0.

Additionally, a background task is normally an independent set of logic that should be handled separately, with its own resources (e.g. its own database connection).

If you used to rely on this behavior, now you should create the resources for background tasks inside the background task itself, and use internally only data that doesn't depend on the resources of dependencies with `yield`.

For example, instead of using the same database session, you would create a new database session inside of the background task, and you would obtain the objects from the database using this new session. And then instead of passing the object from the database as a parameter to the background task function, you would pass the ID of that object and then obtain the object again inside the background task function.

The sequence of execution before FastAPI 0.106.0 was like this diagram:

Time flows from top to bottom. And each column is one of the parts interacting or executing code.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

participant client as Client
participant handler as Exception handler
participant dep as Dep with yield
participant operation as Path Operation
participant tasks as Background tasks

    Note over client,tasks: Can raise exception for dependency, handled after response is sent
    Note over client,operation: Can raise HTTPException and can change the response
    client ->> dep: Start request
    Note over dep: Run code up to yield
    opt raise
        dep -->> handler: Raise HTTPException
        handler -->> client: HTTP error response
        dep -->> dep: Raise other exception
    end
    dep ->> operation: Run dependency, e.g. DB session
    opt raise
        operation -->> dep: Raise HTTPException
        dep -->> handler: Auto forward exception
        handler -->> client: HTTP error response
        operation -->> dep: Raise other exception
        dep -->> handler: Auto forward exception
    end
    operation ->> client: Return response to client
    Note over client,operation: Response is already sent, can't change it anymore
    opt Tasks
        operation -->> tasks: Send background tasks
    end
    opt Raise other exception
        tasks -->> dep: Raise other exception
    end
    Note over dep: After yield
    opt Handle other exception
        dep -->> dep: Handle exception, can't change response. E.g. close DB session.
    end
```

The new execution flow can be found in the docs: [Execution of dependencies with `yield`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-with-yield/#execution-of-dependencies-with-yield).

## 0.100.0

✨ Support for **Pydantic v2** ✨

Pydantic version 2 has the **core** re-written in **Rust** and includes a lot of improvements and features, for example:

* Improved **correctness** in corner cases.
* **Safer** types.
* Better **performance** and **less energy** consumption.
* Better **extensibility**.
* etc.

...all this while keeping the **same Python API**. In most of the cases, for simple models, you can simply upgrade the Pydantic version and get all the benefits. 🚀

In some cases, for pure data validation and processing, you can get performance improvements of **20x** or more. This means 2,000% or more. 🤯

When you use **FastAPI**, there's a lot more going on, processing the request and response, handling dependencies, executing **your own code**, and particularly, **waiting for the network**. But you will probably still get some nice performance improvements just from the upgrade.

The focus of this release is **compatibility** with Pydantic v1 and v2, to make sure your current apps keep working. Later there will be more focus on refactors, correctness, code improvements, and then **performance** improvements. Some third-party early beta testers that ran benchmarks on the beta releases of FastAPI reported improvements of **2x - 3x**. Which is not bad for just doing `pip install --upgrade fastapi pydantic`. This was not an official benchmark and I didn't check it myself, but it's a good sign.

### Migration

Check out the [Pydantic migration guide](https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.0/migration/).

For the things that need changes in your Pydantic models, the Pydantic team built [`bump-pydantic`](https://github.com/pydantic/bump-pydantic).

A command line tool that will **process your code** and update most of the things **automatically** for you. Make sure you have your code in git first, and review each of the changes to make sure everything is correct before committing the changes.

### Pydantic v1

**This version of FastAPI still supports Pydantic v1**. And although Pydantic v1 will be deprecated at some point, it will still be supported for a while.

This means that you can install the new Pydantic v2, and if something fails, you can install Pydantic v1 while you fix any problems you might have, but having the latest FastAPI.

There are **tests for both Pydantic v1 and v2**, and test **coverage** is kept at **100%**.

### Changes

* There are **new parameter** fields supported by Pydantic `Field()` for:

    * `Path()`
    * `Query()`
    * `Header()`
    * `Cookie()`
    * `Body()`
    * `Form()`
    * `File()`

* The new parameter fields are:

    * `default_factory`
    * `alias_priority`
    * `validation_alias`
    * `serialization_alias`
    * `discriminator`
    * `strict`
    * `multiple_of`
    * `allow_inf_nan`
    * `max_digits`
    * `decimal_places`
    * `json_schema_extra`

...you can read about them in the Pydantic docs.

* The parameter `regex` has been deprecated and replaced by `pattern`.
    * You can read more about it in the docs for [Query Parameters and String Validations: Add regular expressions](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#add-regular-expressions).
* New Pydantic models use an improved and simplified attribute `model_config` that takes a simple dict instead of an internal class `Config` for their configuration.
    * You can read more about it in the docs for [Declare Request Example Data](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/schema-extra-example/).
* The attribute `schema_extra` for the internal class `Config` has been replaced by the key `json_schema_extra` in the new `model_config` dict.
    * You can read more about it in the docs for [Declare Request Example Data](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/schema-extra-example/).
* When you install `"fastapi[all]"` it now also includes:
    * <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/pydantic_settings/" target="_blank"><code>pydantic-settings</code></a> - for settings management.
    * <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/types/extra_types/extra_types/" target="_blank"><code>pydantic-extra-types</code></a> - for extra types to be used with Pydantic.
* Now Pydantic Settings is an additional optional package (included in `"fastapi[all]"`). To use settings you should now import `from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings` instead of importing from `pydantic` directly.
    * You can read more about it in the docs for [Settings and Environment Variables](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/settings/).

* PR [#9816](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/9816) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo), included all the work done (in multiple PRs) on the beta branch (`main-pv2`).

## 0.95.0

### Highlights

This release adds support for dependencies and parameters using `Annotated` and recommends its usage. ✨

This has **several benefits**, one of the main ones is that now the parameters of your functions with `Annotated` would **not be affected** at all.

If you call those functions in **other places in your code**, the actual **default values** will be kept, your editor will help you notice missing **required arguments**, Python will require you to pass required arguments at **runtime**, you will be able to **use the same functions** for different things and with different libraries (e.g. **Typer** will soon support `Annotated` too, then you could use the same function for an API and a CLI), etc.

Because `Annotated` is **standard Python**, you still get all the **benefits** from editors and tools, like **autocompletion**, **inline errors**, etc.

One of the **biggest benefits** is that now you can create `Annotated` dependencies that are then shared by multiple *path operation functions*, this will allow you to **reduce** a lot of **code duplication** in your codebase, while keeping all the support from editors and tools.

For example, you could have code like this:

```Python
def get_current_user(token: str):
    # authenticate user
    return User()


@app.get("/items/")
def read_items(user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    ...


@app.post("/items/")
def create_item(*, user: User = Depends(get_current_user), item: Item):
    ...


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(*, user: User = Depends(get_current_user), item_id: int):
    ...


@app.delete("/items/{item_id}")
def delete_item(*, user: User = Depends(get_current_user), item_id: int):
    ...
```

There's a bit of code duplication for the dependency:

```Python
user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
```

...the bigger the codebase, the more noticeable it is.

Now you can create an annotated dependency once, like this:

```Python
CurrentUser = Annotated[User, Depends(get_current_user)]
```

And then you can reuse this `Annotated` dependency:

```Python
CurrentUser = Annotated[User, Depends(get_current_user)]


@app.get("/items/")
def read_items(user: CurrentUser):
    ...


@app.post("/items/")
def create_item(user: CurrentUser, item: Item):
    ...


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(user: CurrentUser, item_id: int):
    ...


@app.delete("/items/{item_id}")
def delete_item(user: CurrentUser, item_id: int):
    ...
```

...and `CurrentUser` has all the typing information as `User`, so your editor will work as expected (autocompletion and everything), and **FastAPI** will be able to understand the dependency defined in `Annotated`. 😎

Roughly **all the docs** have been rewritten to use `Annotated` as the main way to declare **parameters** and **dependencies**. All the **examples** in the docs now include a version with `Annotated` and a version without it, for each of the specific Python versions (when there are small differences/improvements in more recent versions). There were around 23K new lines added between docs, examples, and tests. 🚀

The key updated docs are:

* Python Types Intro:
    * [Type Hints with Metadata Annotations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/python-types/#type-hints-with-metadata-annotations).
* Tutorial:
    * [Query Parameters and String Validations - Additional validation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#additional-validation)
        * [Advantages of `Annotated`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#advantages-of-annotated)
    * [Path Parameters and Numeric Validations - Order the parameters as you need, tricks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-params-numeric-validations/#order-the-parameters-as-you-need-tricks)
        * [Better with `Annotated`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-params-numeric-validations/#better-with-annotated)
    * [Dependencies - First Steps - Share `Annotated` dependencies](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/#share-annotated-dependencies)

## 0.93.0

### Features

* ✨ Add support for `lifespan` async context managers (superseding `startup` and `shutdown` events). Initial PR [#2944](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/2944) by [@uSpike](https://github.com/uSpike).

Now, instead of using independent `startup` and `shutdown` events, you can define that logic in a single function with `yield` decorated with `@asynccontextmanager` (an async context manager).

For example:

```Python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

from fastapi import FastAPI


def fake_answer_to_everything_ml_model(x: float):
    return x * 42


ml_models = {}


@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # Load the ML model
    ml_models["answer_to_everything"] = fake_answer_to_everything_ml_model
    yield
    # Clean up the ML models and release the resources
    ml_models.clear()


app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)


@app.get("/predict")
async def predict(x: float):
    result = ml_models["answer_to_everything"](x)
    return {"result": result}
```

**Note**: This is the recommended way going forward, instead of using `startup` and `shutdown` events.

## 0.92.0

🚨 This is a security fix. Please upgrade as soon as possible.

### Upgrades

* ⬆️ Upgrade Starlette to 0.25.0. PR [#5996](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/5996) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).
    * This solves a vulnerability that could allow denial of service attacks by using many small multipart fields/files (parts), consuming high CPU and memory.
    * Only applications using forms (e.g. file uploads) could be affected.
    * For most cases, upgrading won't have any breaking changes.

## 0.91.0

### Upgrades

* ⬆️ Upgrade Starlette version to `0.24.0` and refactor internals for compatibility. PR [#5985](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/5985) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).
    * This can solve nuanced errors when using middlewares. Before Starlette `0.24.0`, a new instance of each middleware class would be created when a new middleware was added. That normally was not a problem, unless the middleware class expected to be created only once, with only one instance, that happened in some cases. This upgrade would solve those cases (thanks [@adriangb](https://github.com/adriangb)! Starlette PR [#2017](https://github.com/encode/starlette/pull/2017)). Now the middleware class instances are created once, right before the first request (the first time the app is called).
    * If you depended on that previous behavior, you might need to update your code. As always, make sure your tests pass before merging the upgrade.

## 0.89.0

### Features

* ✨ Add support for function return type annotations to declare the `response_model`. Initial PR [#1436](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1436) by [@uriyyo](https://github.com/uriyyo).

Now you can declare the return type / `response_model` in the function return type annotation:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items() -> list[Item]:
    return [
        Item(name="Portal Gun", price=42.0),
        Item(name="Plumbus", price=32.0),
    ]
```

FastAPI will use the return type annotation to perform:

* Data validation
* Automatic documentation
    * It could power automatic client generators
* **Data filtering**

Before this version it was only supported via the `response_model` parameter.

## 0.87.0

Highlights of this release:

* [Upgraded Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette/releases/tag/0.21.0)
    * Now the `TestClient` is based on HTTPX instead of Requests. 🚀
    * There are some possible **breaking changes** in the `TestClient` usage, but [@Kludex](https://github.com/Kludex) built [bump-testclient](https://github.com/Kludex/bump-testclient) to help you automatize migrating your tests. Make sure you are using Git and that you can undo any unnecessary changes (false positive changes, etc) before using `bump-testclient`.
* New [WebSocketException (and docs)](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/#using-depends-and-others), re-exported from Starlette.
* Upgraded and relaxed dependencies for package extras `all` (including new Uvicorn version), when you install `"fastapi[all]"`.
* New docs about how to [**Help Maintain FastAPI**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#help-maintain-fastapi).

### Breaking Changes - Fixes

* 🐛 Fix `response_model` not invalidating `None`. PR [#2725](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/2725) by [@hukkin](https://github.com/hukkin).

If you are using `response_model` with some type that doesn't include `None` but the function is returning `None`, it will now raise an internal server error, because you are returning invalid data that violates the contract in `response_model`. Before this release it would allow breaking that contract returning `None`.

For example, if you have an app like this:

```Python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: Optional[float] = None
    owner_ids: Optional[List[int]] = None

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/invalidnone", response_model=Item)
def get_invalid_none():
    return None
```

...calling the path `/items/invalidnone` will raise an error, because `None` is not a valid type for the `response_model` declared with `Item`.

You could also be implicitly returning `None` without realizing, for example:

```Python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: Optional[float] = None
    owner_ids: Optional[List[int]] = None

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/invalidnone", response_model=Item)
def get_invalid_none():
    if flag:
        return {"name": "foo"}
    # if flag is False, at this point the function will implicitly return None
```

If you have *path operations* using `response_model` that need to be allowed to return `None`, make it explicit in `response_model` using `Union[Something, None]`:

```Python
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: Optional[float] = None
    owner_ids: Optional[List[int]] = None

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/invalidnone", response_model=Union[Item, None])
def get_invalid_none():
    return None
```

This way the data will be correctly validated, you won't have an internal server error, and the documentation will also reflect that this *path operation* could return `None` (or `null` in JSON).

* 🐛 Fix removing body from status codes that do not support it. PR [#5145](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/5145) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).
    * Setting `status_code` to `204`, `304`, or any code below `200` (1xx) will remove the body from the response.
    * This fixes an error in Uvicorn that otherwise would be thrown: `RuntimeError: Response content longer than Content-Length`.
    * This removes `fastapi.openapi.constants.STATUS_CODES_WITH_NO_BODY`, it is replaced by a function in utils.

## 0.78.0

### Features

* ✨ Add support for omitting `...` as default value when declaring required parameters with:

* `Path()`
* `Query()`
* `Header()`
* `Cookie()`
* `Body()`
* `Form()`
* `File()`

New docs at [Tutorial - Query Parameters and String Validations - Make it required](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#make-it-required). PR [#4906](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4906) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

Up to now, declaring a required parameter while adding additional validation or metadata needed using `...` (Ellipsis).

For example:

```Python
from fastapi import Cookie, FastAPI, Header, Path, Query

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def main(
    item_id: int = Path(default=..., gt=0),
    query: str = Query(default=..., max_length=10),
    session: str = Cookie(default=..., min_length=3),
    x_trace: str = Header(default=..., title="Tracing header"),
):
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

...all these parameters are required because the default value is `...` (Ellipsis).

But now it's possible and supported to just omit the default value, as would be done with Pydantic fields, and the parameters would still be required.

✨ For example, this is now supported:

```Python
from fastapi import Cookie, FastAPI, Header, Path, Query

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def main(
    item_id: int = Path(gt=0),
    query: str = Query(max_length=10),
    session: str = Cookie(min_length=3),
    x_trace: str = Header(title="Tracing header"),
):
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

To declare parameters as optional (not required), you can set a default value as always, for example using `None`:

```Python
from typing import Union
from fastapi import Cookie, FastAPI, Header, Path, Query

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def main(
    item_id: int = Path(gt=0),
    query: Union[str, None] = Query(default=None, max_length=10),
    session: Union[str, None] = Cookie(default=None, min_length=3),
    x_trace: Union[str, None] = Header(default=None, title="Tracing header"),
):
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

## 0.75.0

### Features

## 0.74.1

### Features

* ✨ Include route in scope to allow middleware and other tools to extract its information. PR [#4603](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4603) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

## 0.74.0

### Breaking Changes

* ✨ Update internal `AsyncExitStack` to fix context for dependencies with `yield`. PR [#4575](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4575) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

Dependencies with `yield` can now catch `HTTPException` and custom exceptions. For example:

```Python
async def get_database():
    with Session() as session:
        try:
            yield session
        except HTTPException:
            session.rollback()
            raise
        finally:
            session.close()
```

After the dependency with `yield` handles the exception (or not) the exception is raised again. So that any exception handlers can catch it, or ultimately the default internal `ServerErrorMiddleware`.

If you depended on exceptions not being received by dependencies with `yield`, and receiving an exception breaks the code after `yield`, you can use a block with `try` and `finally`:

```Python
async def do_something():
    try:
        yield something
    finally:
        some_cleanup()
```

...that way the `finally` block is run regardless of any exception that might happen.

### Features

* The same PR [#4575](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4575) from above also fixes the `contextvars` context for the code before and after `yield`. This was the main objective of that PR.

This means that now, if you set a value in a context variable before `yield`, the value would still be available after `yield` (as you would intuitively expect). And it also means that you can reset the context variable with a token afterwards.

For example, this works correctly now:

```Python
from contextvars import ContextVar
from typing import Any, Dict, Optional


legacy_request_state_context_var: ContextVar[Optional[Dict[str, Any]]] = ContextVar(
    "legacy_request_state_context_var", default=None
)

async def set_up_request_state_dependency():
    request_state = {"user": "deadpond"}
    contextvar_token = legacy_request_state_context_var.set(request_state)
    yield request_state
    legacy_request_state_context_var.reset(contextvar_token)
```

...before this change it would raise an error when resetting the context variable, because the `contextvars` context was different, because of the way it was implemented.

**Note**: You probably don't need `contextvars`, and you should probably avoid using them. But they are powerful and useful in some advanced scenarios, for example, migrating from code that used Flask's `g` semi-global variable.

**Technical Details**: If you want to know more of the technical details you can check out the PR description [#4575](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4575).

## 0.70.0

This release just upgrades Starlette to the latest version, `0.16.0`, which includes several bug fixes and some small breaking changes.

These last **three consecutive releases** are independent so that you can **migrate gradually**:

* First to FastAPI `0.68.2`, with no breaking changes, but upgrading all the sub-dependencies.
* Next to FastAPI `0.69.0`, which upgrades Starlette to `0.15.0`, with AnyIO support, and a higher chance of having breaking changes in your code.
* Finally to FastAPI `0.70.0`, just upgrading Starlette to the latest version `0.16.0` with additional bug fixes.

This way, in case there was a breaking change for your code in one of the releases, you can still benefit from the previous upgrades. ✨

### Breaking Changes - Upgrade

* ⬆️ Upgrade Starlette to 0.16.0. PR [#4016](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4016) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

Also upgrades the ranges of optional dependencies:

* `"jinja2 >=2.11.2,<4.0.0"`
* `"itsdangerous >=1.1.0,<3.0.0"`

## 0.69.0

### Breaking Changes - Upgrade

This release adds support for [Trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). ✨

It upgrades the version of Starlette to `0.15.0`, now based on [AnyIO](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and the internal async components in **FastAPI** are now based on AnyIO as well, making it compatible with both **asyncio** and **Trio**.

You can read the docs about running [FastAPI with Trio using Hypercorn](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/manually/#hypercorn-with-trio).

This release also removes `graphene` as an optional dependency for GraphQL. If you need to work with GraphQL, the recommended library now is [Strawberry](https://strawberry.rocks/). You can read the new [FastAPI with GraphQL docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/graphql/).

## 0.68.2

This release has **no breaking changes**. 🎉

It upgrades the version ranges of sub-dependencies to allow applications using FastAPI to easily upgrade them.

Soon there will be a new FastAPI release upgrading Starlette to take advantage of recent improvements, but as that has a higher chance of having breaking changes, it will be in a separate release.

* 🔒 Check Content-Type request header before assuming JSON. Initial PR [#2118](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/2118) by [@patrickkwang](https://github.com/patrickkwang).

This change fixes a [CSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) security vulnerability when using cookies for authentication in path operations with JSON payloads sent by browsers.

In versions lower than `0.65.2`, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the `content-type` header sent was not set to `application/json` or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. `application/geo+json`).

So, a request with a content type of `text/plain` containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted.

But requests with content type `text/plain` are exempt from [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) preflights, for being considered [Simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests). So, the browser would execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application.

See [CVE-2021-32677](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/security/advisories/GHSA-8h2j-cgx8-6xv7) for more details.

## 0.62.0

### Features

* ✨ Add support for shared/top-level parameters (dependencies, tags, etc). PR [#2434](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/2434) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

Up to now, for several options, the only way to apply them to a group of *path operations* was in `include_router`. That works well, but the call to `app.include_router()` or `router.include_router()` is normally done in another file.

That means that, for example, to apply authentication to all the *path operations* in a router it would end up being done in a different file, instead of keeping related logic together.

Setting options in `include_router` still makes sense in some cases, for example, to override or increase configurations from a third party router included in an app. But in a router that is part of a bigger application, it would probably make more sense to add those settings when creating the `APIRouter`.

**In `FastAPI`**

This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters):

* `default_response_class`: updated to handle defaults in `APIRouter` and `include_router`.
* `dependencies`: to include ✨ top-level dependencies ✨ that apply to the whole application. E.g. to add global authentication.
* `callbacks`: OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the *path operations*.
* `deprecated`: to mark all the *path operations* as deprecated. 🤷
* `include_in_schema`: to allow excluding all the *path operations* from the OpenAPI schema.
* `responses`: OpenAPI responses that apply to all the *path operations*.

For example:

```Python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends


async def some_dependency():
    return


app = FastAPI(dependencies=[Depends(some_dependency)])
```

**In `APIRouter`**

This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters):

* `default_response_class`: updated to handle defaults in `APIRouter` and `include_router`. For example, it's not needed to set it explicitly when [creating callbacks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/openapi-callbacks/).
* `dependencies`: to include ✨ router-level dependencies ✨ that apply to all the *path operations* in a router. Up to now, this was only possible with `include_router`.
* `callbacks`: OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the *path operations* in this router.
* `deprecated`: to mark all the *path operations* in a router as deprecated.
* `include_in_schema`: to allow excluding all the *path operations* in a router from the OpenAPI schema.
* `responses`: OpenAPI responses that apply to all the *path operations* in a router.
* `prefix`: to set the path prefix for a router. Up to now, this was only possible when calling `include_router`.
* `tags`: OpenAPI tags to apply to all the *path operations* in this router.

For example:

```Python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends


async def some_dependency():
    return


router = APIRouter(prefix="/users", dependencies=[Depends(some_dependency)])
```

**In `include_router`**

Most of these settings are now supported in `APIRouter`, which normally lives closer to the related code, so it is recommended to use `APIRouter` when possible.

But `include_router` is still useful to, for example, adding options (like `dependencies`, `prefix`, and `tags`) when including a third party router, or a generic router that is shared between several projects.

This PR allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters):

* `default_response_class`: updated to handle defaults in `APIRouter` and `FastAPI`.
* `deprecated`: to mark all the *path operations* in a router as deprecated in OpenAPI.
* `include_in_schema`: to allow disabling all the *path operations* from showing in the OpenAPI schema.
* `callbacks`: OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the *path operations* in this router.

Note: all the previous parameters are still there, so it's still possible to declare `dependencies` in `include_router`.

### Breaking Changes

* PR [#2434](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/2434) includes several improvements that shouldn't affect normal use cases, but could affect in advanced scenarios:
    * If you are testing the generated OpenAPI (you shouldn't, FastAPI already tests it extensively for you): the order for `tags` in `include_router` and *path operations* was updated for consistency, but it's a simple order change.
    * If you have advanced custom logic to access each route's `route.response_class`, or the `router.default_response_class`, or the `app.default_response_class`: the default value for `response_class` in `APIRoute` and for `default_response_class` in `APIRouter` and `FastAPI` is now a `DefaultPlaceholder` used internally to handle and solve default values and overrides. The actual response class inside the `DefaultPlaceholder` is available at `route.response_class.value`.

### Docs

### Internal

* Improve docs maintainability by updating `hl_lines` syntax to use ranges. PR [#1863](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1863) by [@la-mar](https://github.com/la-mar).

## 0.61.0

### Features

* Add support for injecting `HTTPConnection` (as `Request` and `WebSocket`). Useful for sharing app state in dependencies. PR [#1827](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1827) by [@nsidnev](https://github.com/nsidnev).
* Export `WebSocketDisconnect` and add example handling WebSocket disconnections to docs. PR [#1822](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1822) by [@rkbeatss](https://github.com/rkbeatss).

### Breaking Changes

* Require Pydantic > `1.0.0`.
    * Remove support for deprecated Pydantic `0.32.2`. This improves maintainability and allows new features.
    * In `FastAPI` and `APIRouter`:
        * Remove *path operation decorators* related/deprecated parameter `response_model_skip_defaults` (use `response_model_exclude_unset` instead).
        * Change *path operation decorators* parameter default for `response_model_exclude` from `set()` to `None` (as is in Pydantic).
    * In `encoders.jsonable_encoder`:
        * Remove deprecated `skip_defaults`, use instead `exclude_unset`.
        * Set default of `exclude` from `set()` to `None` (as is in Pydantic).
    * PR [#1862](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1862).
* In `encoders.jsonable_encoder` remove parameter `sqlalchemy_safe`.
    * It was an early hack to allow returning SQLAlchemy models, but it was never documented, and the recommended way is using Pydantic's `orm_mode` as described in the tutorial: [SQL (Relational) Databases](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/sql-databases/).
    * PR [#1864](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1864).

### Docs

* Add link to the course by TestDriven.io: [Test-Driven Development with FastAPI and Docker](https://testdriven.io/courses/tdd-fastapi/). PR [#1860](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1860).

* Add docs about [Async Tests](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/async-tests/). PR [#1619](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1619) by [@empicano](https://github.com/empicano).
* Raise an exception when using form data (`Form`, `File`) without having `python-multipart` installed.
    * Up to now the application would run, and raise an exception only when receiving a request with form data, the new behavior, raising early, will prevent from deploying applications with broken dependencies.
    * It also detects if the correct package `python-multipart` is installed instead of the incorrect `multipart` (both importable as `multipart`).
    * PR [#1851](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1851) based on original PR [#1627](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1627) by [@chrisngyn](https://github.com/chrisngyn), [@YKo20010](https://github.com/YKo20010), [@kx-chen](https://github.com/kx-chen).

## 0.51.0

* Re-export utils from Starlette:
    * This allows using things like `from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse` instead of `from starlette.responses import JSONResponse`.
    * It's mainly syntax sugar, a convenience for developer experience.
    * Now `Request`, `Response`, `WebSocket`, `status` can be imported directly from `fastapi` as in `from fastapi import Response`. This is because those are frequently used, to use the request directly, to set headers and cookies, to get status codes, etc.
    * Documentation changes in many places, but new docs and noticeable improvements:

## 0.42.0

* Add dependencies with `yield`, a.k.a. exit steps, context managers, cleanup, teardown, ...
    * This allows adding extra code after a dependency is done. It can be used, for example, to close database connections.
    * Dependencies with `yield` can be normal or `async`, **FastAPI** will run normal dependencies in a threadpool.
    * They can be combined with normal dependencies.
    * It's possible to have arbitrary trees/levels of dependencies with `yield` and exit steps are handled in the correct order automatically.
    * It works by default in Python 3.7 or above. For Python 3.6, it requires the extra backport dependencies:
        * `async-exit-stack`
        * `async-generator`
    * New docs at [Dependencies with `yield`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-with-yield/).

    * PR [#593](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/593).
* Improve handling of custom classes for `Request`s and `APIRoute`s.
    * This helps to more easily solve use cases like:
        * Reading a body before and/or after a request (equivalent to a middleware).
        * Run middleware-like code only for a subset of *path operations*.
        * Process a request before passing it to a *path operation function*. E.g. decompressing, deserializing, etc.
        * Processing a response after being generated by *path operation functions* but before returning it. E.g. adding custom headers, logging, adding extra metadata.
    * New docs section: [Custom Request and APIRoute class](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-request-and-route/).
    * PR [#589](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/589) by [@dmontagu](https://github.com/dmontagu).

## 0.39.0

* Allow path parameters to have default values (e.g. `None`) and discard them instead of raising an error.
    * This allows declaring a parameter like `user_id: str = None` that can be taken from a query parameter, but the same *path operation* can be included in a router with a path `/users/{user_id}`, in which case will be taken from the path and will be required.

* Fix OpenAPI/JSON Schema generation for two functions with the same name (in different modules) with the same composite bodies.
    * Composite bodies' IDs are now based on path, not only on route name, as the auto-generated name uses the function names, that can be duplicated in different modules.
    * The same new ID generation applies to response models.
    * This also changes the generated title for those models.
    * Only composite bodies and response models are affected because those are generated dynamically, they don't have a module (a Python file).
    * This also adds the possibility of using `.include_router()` with the same `APIRouter` *multiple*  times, with different prefixes, e.g. `/api/v2` and `/api/latest`, and it will now work correctly.
    * PR [#347](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/347).

## 0.30.0

* Add support for Pydantic's ORM mode:
    * Updated documentation about SQL with SQLAlchemy, using Pydantic models with ORM mode, SQLAlchemy models with relations, separation of files, simplification of code and other changes. New docs: [SQL (Relational) Databases](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/sql-databases/).
    * The new support for ORM mode fixes issues/adds features related to ORMs with lazy-loading, hybrid properties, dynamic/getters (using `@property` decorators) and several other use cases.
    * This applies to ORMs like SQLAlchemy, Peewee, Tortoise ORM, GINO ORM and virtually any other.
    * If your *path operations* return an arbitrary object with attributes (e.g. `my_item.name` instead of `my_item["name"]`) AND you use a `response_model`, make sure to update the Pydantic models with `orm_mode = True` as described in the docs (link above).
    * New documentation about receiving plain `dict`s as request bodies: [Bodies of arbitrary `dict`s](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body-nested-models/#bodies-of-arbitrary-dicts).
    * New documentation about returning arbitrary `dict`s in responses: [Response with arbitrary `dict`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/extra-models/#response-with-arbitrary-dict).
    * **Technical Details**:
        * When declaring a `response_model` it is used directly to generate the response content, from whatever was returned from the *path operation function*.
        * Before this, the return content was first passed through `jsonable_encoder` to ensure it was a "jsonable" object, like a `dict`, instead of an arbitrary object with attributes (like an ORM model). That's why you should make sure to update your Pydantic models for objects with attributes to use `orm_mode = True`.
        * If you don't have a `response_model`, the return object will still be passed through `jsonable_encoder` first.
        * When a `response_model` is declared, the same `response_model` type declaration won't be used as is, it will be "cloned" to create an new one (a cloned Pydantic `Field` with all the submodels cloned as well).
        * This avoids/fixes a potential security issue: as the returned object is passed directly to Pydantic, if the returned object was a subclass of the `response_model` (e.g. you return a `UserInDB` that inherits from `User` but contains extra fields, like `hashed_password`, and `User` is used in the `response_model`), it would still pass the validation (because `UserInDB` is a subclass of `User`) and the object would be returned as-is, including the `hashed_password`. To fix this, the declared `response_model` is cloned, if it is a Pydantic model class (or contains Pydantic model classes in it, e.g. in a `List[Item]`), the Pydantic model class(es) will be a different one (the "cloned" one). So, an object that is a subclass won't simply pass the validation and returned as-is, because it is no longer a sub-class of the cloned `response_model`. Instead, a new Pydantic model object will be created with the contents of the returned object. So, it will be a new object (made with the data from the returned one), and will be filtered by the cloned `response_model`, containing only the declared fields as normally.

## 0.29.0

* Add support for declaring a `Response` parameter:
    * This allows declaring:
        * [Response Cookies](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-cookies/).
        * [Response Headers](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-headers/).
        * An HTTP Status Code different than the default: [Response - Change Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-change-status-code/).
    * All of this while still being able to return arbitrary objects (`dict`, DB model, etc).
    * Update attribution to Hug, for inspiring the `response` parameter pattern.
    * PR [#294](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/294).

## 0.28.0

* Implement dependency cache per request.
    * This avoids calling each dependency multiple times for the same request.
    * This is useful while calling external services, performing costly computation, etc.
    * This also means that if a dependency was declared as a *path operation decorator* dependency, possibly at the router level (with `.include_router()`) and then it is declared again in a specific *path operation*, the dependency will be called only once.
    * The cache can be disabled per dependency declaration, using `use_cache=False` as in `Depends(your_dependency, use_cache=False)`.
    * Updated docs at: [Using the same dependency multiple times](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/sub-dependencies/#using-the-same-dependency-multiple-times).
    * PR [#292](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/292).

    * PR [#278](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/278).

## 0.26.0

    * This will allow developers to customize the exception handlers.
    * Document better how to handle exceptions and use error handlers.
    * Include `RequestValidationError` and `WebSocketRequestValidationError` (this last one will be useful once [encode/starlette#527](https://github.com/encode/starlette/pull/527) or equivalent is merged).
    * New documentation about exceptions handlers:

        * `Cookie`
        * `Header`
        * `Path`

## 0.23.0

* Upgrade the compatible version of Starlette to `0.12.0`.
    * This includes support for ASGI 3 (the latest version of the standard).
    * It's now possible to use [Starlette's `StreamingResponse`](https://www.starlette.io/responses/#streamingresponse) with iterators, like [file-like](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-like-object) objects (as those returned by `open()`).
    * It's now possible to use the low level utility `iterate_in_threadpool` from `starlette.concurrency` (for advanced scenarios).
    * PR [#243](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/243).

* Add OAuth2 redirect page for Swagger UI. This allows having delegated authentication in the Swagger UI docs. For this to work, you need to add `{your_origin}/docs/oauth2-redirect` to the allowed callbacks in your OAuth2 provider (in Auth0, Facebook, Google, etc).
    * For example, during development, it could be `http://localhost:8000/docs/oauth2-redirect`.
    * Keep in mind that this callback URL is independent of whichever one is used by your frontend. You might also have another callback at `https://yourdomain.com/login/callback`.
    * This is only to allow delegated authentication in the API docs with Swagger UI.
    * PR [#198](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/198) by [@steinitzu](https://github.com/steinitzu).

* Make Swagger UI and ReDoc route handlers (*path operations*) be `async` functions instead of lambdas to improve performance. PR [#241](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/241) by [@Trim21](https://github.com/Trim21).

## 0.22.0

* Add support for `dependencies` parameter:
    * A parameter in *path operation decorators*, for dependencies that should be executed but the return value is not important or not used in the *path operation function*.
    * A parameter in the `.include_router()` method of FastAPI applications and routers, to include dependencies that should be executed in each *path operation* in a router.
        * This is useful, for example, to require authentication or permissions in specific group of *path operations*.
        * Different `dependencies` can be applied to different routers.
    * These `dependencies` are run before the normal parameter dependencies. And normal dependencies are run too. They can be combined.
    * Dependencies declared in a router are executed first, then the ones defined in *path operation decorators*, and then the ones declared in normal parameters. They are all combined and executed.
    * All this also supports using `Security` with `scopes` in those `dependencies` parameters, for more advanced OAuth 2.0 security scenarios with scopes.
    * New documentation about [dependencies in *path operation decorators*](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/).
    * New documentation about [dependencies in the `include_router()` method](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/#include-an-apirouter-with-a-prefix-tags-responses-and-dependencies).
    * PR [#235](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/235).

* Fix OpenAPI documentation of Starlette URL convertors. Specially useful when using `path` convertors, to take a whole path as a parameter, like `/some/url/{p:path}`. PR [#234](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/234) by [@euri10](https://github.com/euri10).

# Virtual Environments

When you work in Python projects you probably should use a **virtual environment** (or a similar mechanism) to isolate the packages you install for each project.

/// info

If you already know about virtual environments, how to create them and use them, you might want to skip this section. 🤓

///

/// tip

A **virtual environment** is different than an **environment variable**.

An **environment variable** is a variable in the system that can be used by programs.

A **virtual environment** is a directory with some files in it.

///

/// info

This page will teach you how to use **virtual environments** and how they work.

If you are ready to adopt a **tool that manages everything** for you (including installing Python), try <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv" class="external-link" target="_blank">uv</a>.

///

## Create a Project

First, create a directory for your project.

What I normally do is that I create a directory named `code` inside my home/user directory.

And inside of that I create one directory per project.

<div class="termy">

```console
// Go to the home directory
$ cd
// Create a directory for all your code projects
$ mkdir code
// Enter into that code directory
$ cd code
// Create a directory for this project
$ mkdir awesome-project
// Enter into that project directory
$ cd awesome-project
```

</div>

## Create a Virtual Environment

When you start working on a Python project **for the first time**, create a virtual environment **<abbr title="there are other options, this is a simple guideline">inside your project</abbr>**.

/// tip

You only need to do this **once per project**, not every time you work.

///

//// tab | `venv`

To create a virtual environment, you can use the `venv` module that comes with Python.

<div class="termy">

```console
$ python -m venv .venv
```

</div>

/// details | What that command means

* `python`: use the program called `python`
* `-m`: call a module as a script, we'll tell it which module next
* `venv`: use the module called `venv` that normally comes installed with Python
* `.venv`: create the virtual environment in the new directory `.venv`

///

////

//// tab | `uv`

If you have <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv" class="external-link" target="_blank">`uv`</a> installed, you can use it to create a virtual environment.

<div class="termy">

```console
$ uv venv
```

</div>

/// tip

By default, `uv` will create a virtual environment in a directory called `.venv`.

But you could customize it passing an additional argument with the directory name.

///

////

That command creates a new virtual environment in a directory called `.venv`.

/// details | `.venv` or other name

You could create the virtual environment in a different directory, but there's a convention of calling it `.venv`.

///

## Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the new virtual environment so that any Python command you run or package you install uses it.

/// tip

Do this **every time** you start a **new terminal session** to work on the project.

///

//// tab | Linux, macOS

<div class="termy">

```console
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

</div>

////

//// tab | Windows PowerShell

<div class="termy">

```console
$ .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

</div>

////

//// tab | Windows Bash

Or if you use Bash for Windows (e.g. <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Git Bash</a>):

<div class="termy">

```console
$ source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

</div>

////

/// tip

Every time you install a **new package** in that environment, **activate** the environment again.

This makes sure that if you use a **terminal (<abbr title="command line interface">CLI</abbr>) program** installed by that package, you use the one from your virtual environment and not any other that could be installed globally, probably with a different version than what you need.

///

## Check the Virtual Environment is Active

Check that the virtual environment is active (the previous command worked).

/// tip

This is **optional**, but it's a good way to **check** that everything is working as expected and you are using the virtual environment you intended.

///

//// tab | Linux, macOS, Windows Bash

<div class="termy">

```console
$ which python

/home/user/code/awesome-project/.venv/bin/python
```

</div>

If it shows the `python` binary at `.venv/bin/python`, inside of your project (in this case `awesome-project`), then it worked. 🎉

////

//// tab | Windows PowerShell

<div class="termy">

```console
$ Get-Command python

C:\Users\user\code\awesome-project\.venv\Scripts\python
```

</div>

If it shows the `python` binary at `.venv\Scripts\python`, inside of your project (in this case `awesome-project`), then it worked. 🎉

////

## Upgrade `pip`

/// tip

If you use <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv" class="external-link" target="_blank">`uv`</a> you would use it to install things instead of `pip`, so you don't need to upgrade `pip`. 😎

///

If you are using `pip` to install packages (it comes by default with Python), you should **upgrade** it to the latest version.

Many exotic errors while installing a package are solved by just upgrading `pip` first.

/// tip

You would normally do this **once**, right after you create the virtual environment.

///

Make sure the virtual environment is active (with the command above) and then run:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip

---> 100%
```

</div>

## Add `.gitignore`

If you are using **Git** (you should), add a `.gitignore` file to exclude everything in your `.venv` from Git.

/// tip

If you used <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv" class="external-link" target="_blank">`uv`</a> to create the virtual environment, it already did this for you, you can skip this step. 😎

///

/// tip

Do this **once**, right after you create the virtual environment.

///

<div class="termy">

```console
$ echo "*" > .venv/.gitignore
```

</div>

/// details | What that command means

* `echo "*"`: will "print" the text `*` in the terminal (the next part changes that a bit)
* `>`: anything printed to the terminal by the command to the left of `>` should not be printed but instead written to the file that goes to the right of `>`
* `.gitignore`: the name of the file where the text should be written

And `*` for Git means "everything". So, it will ignore everything in the `.venv` directory.

That command will create a file `.gitignore` with the content:

```gitignore
*
```

///

## Install Packages

After activating the environment, you can install packages in it.

/// tip

Do this **once** when installing or upgrading the packages your project needs.

If you need to upgrade a version or add a new package you would **do this again**.

///

### Install Packages Directly

If you're in a hurry and don't want to use a file to declare your project's package requirements, you can install them directly.

/// tip

It's a (very) good idea to put the packages and versions your program needs in a file (for example `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`).

///

//// tab | `pip`

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install "fastapi[standard]"

---> 100%
```

</div>

////

//// tab | `uv`

If you have <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv" class="external-link" target="_blank">`uv`</a>:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ uv pip install "fastapi[standard]"
---> 100%
```

</div>

////

### Install from `requirements.txt`

If you have a `requirements.txt`, you can now use it to install its packages.

//// tab | `pip`

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
---> 100%
```

</div>

////

//// tab | `uv`

If you have <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv" class="external-link" target="_blank">`uv`</a>:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ uv pip install -r requirements.txt
---> 100%
```

</div>

////

/// details | `requirements.txt`

A `requirements.txt` with some packages could look like:

```requirements.txt
fastapi[standard]==0.113.0
pydantic==2.8.0
```

///

## Run Your Program

After you activated the virtual environment, you can run your program, and it will use the Python inside of your virtual environment with the packages you installed there.

<div class="termy">

```console
$ python main.py

Hello World
```

</div>

## Configure Your Editor

You would probably use an editor, make sure you configure it to use the same virtual environment you created (it will probably autodetect it) so that you can get autocompletion and inline errors.

For example:

* <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_select-and-activate-an-environment" class="external-link" target="_blank">VS Code</a>
* <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html" class="external-link" target="_blank">PyCharm</a>

/// tip

You normally have to do this only **once**, when you create the virtual environment.

///

## Deactivate the Virtual Environment

Once you are done working on your project you can **deactivate** the virtual environment.

<div class="termy">

```console
$ deactivate
```

</div>

This way, when you run `python` it won't try to run it from that virtual environment with the packages installed there.

## Ready to Work

Now you're ready to start working on your project.

## Why Virtual Environments

To work with FastAPI you need to install <a href="https://www.python.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Python</a>.

After that, you would need to **install** FastAPI and any other **packages** you want to use.

To install packages you would normally use the `pip` command that comes with Python (or similar alternatives).

Nevertheless, if you just use `pip` directly, the packages would be installed in your **global Python environment** (the global installation of Python).

### The Problem

So, what's the problem with installing packages in the global Python environment?

At some point, you will probably end up writing many different programs that depend on **different packages**. And some of these projects you work on will depend on **different versions** of the same package. 😱

For example, you could create a project called `philosophers-stone`, this program depends on another package called **`harry`, using the version `1`**. So, you need to install `harry`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    stone(philosophers-stone) -->|requires| harry-1[harry v1]
```

Then, at some point later, you create another project called `prisoner-of-azkaban`, and this project also depends on `harry`, but this project needs **`harry` version `3`**.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    azkaban(prisoner-of-azkaban) --> |requires| harry-3[harry v3]
```

But now the problem is, if you install the packages globally (in the global environment) instead of in a local **virtual environment**, you will have to choose which version of `harry` to install.

If you want to run `philosophers-stone` you will need to first install `harry` version `1`, for example with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install "harry==1"
```

</div>

And then you would end up with `harry` version `1` installed in your global Python environment.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph global[global env]
        harry-1[harry v1]
    end
    subgraph stone-project[philosophers-stone project]
        stone(philosophers-stone) -->|requires| harry-1
    end
```

But then if you want to run `prisoner-of-azkaban`, you will need to uninstall `harry` version `1` and install `harry` version `3` (or just installing version `3` would automatically uninstall version `1`).

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install "harry==3"
```

</div>

And then you would end up with `harry` version `3` installed in your global Python environment.

And if you try to run `philosophers-stone` again, there's a chance it would **not work** because it needs `harry` version `1`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph global[global env]
        harry-1[<strike>harry v1</strike>]
        style harry-1 fill:#ccc,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
        harry-3[harry v3]
    end
    subgraph stone-project[philosophers-stone project]
        stone(philosophers-stone) -.-x|⛔️| harry-1
    end
    subgraph azkaban-project[prisoner-of-azkaban project]
        azkaban(prisoner-of-azkaban) --> |requires| harry-3
    end
```

/// tip

It's very common in Python packages to try the best to **avoid breaking changes** in **new versions**, but it's better to be safe, and install newer versions intentionally and when you can run the tests to check everything is working correctly.

///

Now, imagine that with **many** other **packages** that all your **projects depend on**. That's very difficult to manage. And you would probably end up running some projects with some **incompatible versions** of the packages, and not knowing why something isn't working.

Also, depending on your operating system (e.g. Linux, Windows, macOS), it could have come with Python already installed. And in that case it probably had some packages pre-installed with some specific versions **needed by your system**. If you install packages in the global Python environment, you could end up **breaking** some of the programs that came with your operating system.

## Where are Packages Installed

When you install Python, it creates some directories with some files in your computer.

Some of these directories are the ones in charge of having all the packages you install.

When you run:

<div class="termy">

```console
// Don't run this now, it's just an example 🤓
$ pip install "fastapi[standard]"
---> 100%
```

</div>

That will download a compressed file with the FastAPI code, normally from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/fastapi/" class="external-link" target="_blank">PyPI</a>.

It will also **download** files for other packages that FastAPI depends on.

Then it will **extract** all those files and put them in a directory in your computer.

By default, it will put those files downloaded and extracted in the directory that comes with your Python installation, that's the **global environment**.

## What are Virtual Environments

The solution to the problems of having all the packages in the global environment is to use a **virtual environment for each project** you work on.

A virtual environment is a **directory**, very similar to the global one, where you can install the packages for a project.

This way, each project will have its own virtual environment (`.venv` directory) with its own packages.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph stone-project[philosophers-stone project]
        stone(philosophers-stone) --->|requires| harry-1
        subgraph venv1[.venv]
            harry-1[harry v1]
        end
    end
    subgraph azkaban-project[prisoner-of-azkaban project]
        azkaban(prisoner-of-azkaban) --->|requires| harry-3
        subgraph venv2[.venv]
            harry-3[harry v3]
        end
    end
    stone-project ~~~ azkaban-project
```

## What Does Activating a Virtual Environment Mean

When you activate a virtual environment, for example with:

//// tab | Linux, macOS

<div class="termy">

```console
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

</div>

////

//// tab | Windows PowerShell

<div class="termy">

```console
$ .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

</div>

////

//// tab | Windows Bash

Or if you use Bash for Windows (e.g. <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Git Bash</a>):

<div class="termy">

```console
$ source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

</div>

////

That command will create or modify some [environment variables](environment-variables.md){.internal-link target=_blank} that will be available for the next commands.

One of those variables is the `PATH` variable.

/// tip

You can learn more about the `PATH` environment variable in the [Environment Variables](environment-variables.md#path-environment-variable){.internal-link target=_blank} section.

///

Activating a virtual environment adds its path `.venv/bin` (on Linux and macOS) or `.venv\Scripts` (on Windows) to the `PATH` environment variable.

Let's say that before activating the environment, the `PATH` variable looked like this:

//// tab | Linux, macOS

```plaintext
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

That means that the system would look for programs in:

* `/usr/bin`
* `/bin`
* `/usr/sbin`
* `/sbin`

////

//// tab | Windows

```plaintext
C:\Windows\System32
```

That means that the system would look for programs in:

* `C:\Windows\System32`

////

After activating the virtual environment, the `PATH` variable would look something like this:

//// tab | Linux, macOS

```plaintext
/home/user/code/awesome-project/.venv/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

That means that the system will now start looking first for programs in:

```plaintext
/home/user/code/awesome-project/.venv/bin
```

before looking in the other directories.

So, when you type `python` in the terminal, the system will find the Python program in

```plaintext
/home/user/code/awesome-project/.venv/bin/python
```

and use that one.

////

//// tab | Windows

```plaintext
C:\Users\user\code\awesome-project\.venv\Scripts;C:\Windows\System32
```

That means that the system will now start looking first for programs in:

```plaintext
C:\Users\user\code\awesome-project\.venv\Scripts
```

before looking in the other directories.

So, when you type `python` in the terminal, the system will find the Python program in

```plaintext
C:\Users\user\code\awesome-project\.venv\Scripts\python
```

and use that one.

////

An important detail is that it will put the virtual environment path at the **beginning** of the `PATH` variable. The system will find it **before** finding any other Python available. This way, when you run `python`, it will use the Python **from the virtual environment** instead of any other `python` (for example, a `python` from a global environment).

Activating a virtual environment also changes a couple of other things, but this is one of the most important things it does.

## Checking a Virtual Environment

When you check if a virtual environment is active, for example with:

//// tab | Linux, macOS, Windows Bash

<div class="termy">

```console
$ which python

/home/user/code/awesome-project/.venv/bin/python
```

</div>

////

//// tab | Windows PowerShell

<div class="termy">

```console
$ Get-Command python

C:\Users\user\code\awesome-project\.venv\Scripts\python
```

</div>

////

That means that the `python` program that will be used is the one **in the virtual environment**.

You use `which` in Linux and macOS and `Get-Command` in Windows PowerShell.

The way that command works is that it will go and check in the `PATH` environment variable, going through **each path in order**, looking for the program called `python`. Once it finds it, it will **show you the path** to that program.

The most important part is that when you call `python`, that is the exact "`python`" that will be executed.

So, you can confirm if you are in the correct virtual environment.

/// tip

It's easy to activate one virtual environment, get one Python, and then **go to another project**.

And the second project **wouldn't work** because you are using the **incorrect Python**, from a virtual environment for another project.

It's useful being able to check what `python` is being used. 🤓

///

## Why Deactivate a Virtual Environment

For example, you could be working on a project `philosophers-stone`, **activate that virtual environment**, install packages and work with that environment.

And then you want to work on **another project** `prisoner-of-azkaban`.

You go to that project:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ cd ~/code/prisoner-of-azkaban
```

</div>

If you don't deactivate the virtual environment for `philosophers-stone`, when you run `python` in the terminal, it will try to use the Python from `philosophers-stone`.

<div class="termy">

```console
$ cd ~/code/prisoner-of-azkaban

$ python main.py

// Error importing sirius, it's not installed 😱
Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "main.py", line 1, in <module>
        import sirius
```

</div>

But if you deactivate the virtual environment and activate the new one for `prisoner-of-askaban` then when you run `python` it will use the Python from the virtual environment in `prisoner-of-azkaban`.

<div class="termy">

```console
$ cd ~/code/prisoner-of-azkaban

// You don't need to be in the old directory to deactivate, you can do it wherever you are, even after going to the other project 😎
$ deactivate

// Activate the virtual environment in prisoner-of-azkaban/.venv 🚀
$ source .venv/bin/activate

// Now when you run python, it will find the package sirius installed in this virtual environment ✨
$ python main.py

I solemnly swear 🐺
```

</div>

## Alternatives

This is a simple guide to get you started and teach you how everything works **underneath**.

There are many **alternatives** to managing virtual environments, package dependencies (requirements), projects.

Once you are ready and want to use a tool to **manage the entire project**, packages dependencies, virtual environments, etc. I would suggest you try <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv" class="external-link" target="_blank">uv</a>.

`uv` can do a lot of things, it can:

* **Install Python** for you, including different versions
* Manage the **virtual environment** for your projects
* Install **packages**
* Manage package **dependencies and versions** for your project
* Make sure you have an **exact** set of packages and versions to install, including their dependencies, so that you can be sure that you can run your project in production exactly the same as in your computer while developing, this is called **locking**
* And many other things

## Conclusion

If you read and understood all this, now **you know much more** about virtual environments than many developers out there. 🤓

Knowing these details will most probably be useful in a future time when you are debugging something that seems complex, but you will know **how it all works underneath**. 😎
