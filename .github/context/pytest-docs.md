This file is a merged representation of a subset of the codebase, containing specifically included files, combined into a single document by Repomix.

# File Summary

## Purpose
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

## File Format
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A header with the file path (## File: path/to/file)
  b. The full contents of the file in a code block

## Usage Guidelines
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

## Notes
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Only files matching these patterns are included: doc/en/**/*.{md,markdown,mdx,rmd,rst,rest,txt,adoc,asciidoc}
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)

py.test 2.0.0: asserts++, unittest++, reporting++, config++, docs++
===========================================================================

Welcome to pytest-2.0.0, a major new release of "py.test", the rapid
easy Python testing tool.  There are many new features and enhancements,
see below for summary and detailed lists.  A lot of long-deprecated code
has been removed, resulting in a much smaller and cleaner
implementation.  See the new docs with examples here:

    http://pytest.org/en/stable/index.html

A note on packaging: pytest used to part of the "py" distribution up
until version py-1.3.4 but this has changed now:  pytest-2.0.0 only
contains py.test related code and is expected to be backward-compatible
to existing test code. If you want to install pytest, just type one of::

    pip install -U pytest
    easy_install -U pytest

Many thanks to all issue reporters and people asking questions or
complaining.  Particular thanks to Floris Bruynooghe and Ronny Pfannschmidt
for their great coding contributions and many others for feedback and help.

best,
holger krekel


New Features
-----------------------

- new invocations through Python interpreter and from Python::

    python -m pytest      # on all pythons >= 2.5

  or from a python program::

    import pytest ; pytest.main(arglist, pluginlist)

  see http://pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/usage.html for details.

- new and better reporting information in assert expressions
  if comparing lists, sequences or strings.

  see http://pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/assert.html#newreport

- new configuration through ini-files (setup.cfg or tox.ini recognized),
  for example::

    [pytest]
    norecursedirs = .hg data*  # don't ever recurse in such dirs
    addopts = -x --pyargs      # add these command line options by default

  see http://pytest.org/en/stable/reference/customize.html

- improved standard unittest support.  In general py.test should now
  better be able to run custom unittest.TestCases like twisted trial
  or Django based TestCases.  Also you can now run the tests of an
  installed 'unittest' package with py.test::

    py.test --pyargs unittest

- new "-q" option which decreases verbosity and prints a more
  nose/unittest-style "dot" output.

- many, many, more detailed improvements details

Fixes
-----------------------

- fix issue126 - introduce py.test.set_trace() to trace execution via
  PDB during the running of tests even if capturing is ongoing.
- fix issue124 - make reporting more resilient against tests opening
  files on filedescriptor 1 (stdout).
- fix issue109 - sibling conftest.py files will not be loaded.
  (and Directory collectors cannot be customized anymore from a Directory's
  conftest.py - this needs to happen at least one level up).
- fix issue88 (finding custom test nodes from command line arg)
- fix issue93 stdout/stderr is captured while importing conftest.py
- fix bug: unittest collected functions now also can have "pytestmark"
  applied at class/module level

Important Notes
--------------------

* The usual way in pre-2.0 times to use py.test in python code was
  to import "py" and then e.g. use "py.test.raises" for the helper.
  This remains valid and is not planned to be deprecated.  However,
  in most examples and internal code you'll find "import pytest"
  and "pytest.raises" used as the recommended default way.

* pytest now first performs collection of the complete test suite
  before running any test. This changes for example the semantics of when
  pytest_collectstart/pytest_collectreport are called.  Some plugins may
  need upgrading.

* The pytest package consists of a 400 LOC core.py and about 20 builtin plugins,
  summing up to roughly 5000 LOCs, including docstrings. To be fair, it also
  uses generic code from the "pylib", and the new "py" package to help
  with filesystem and introspection/code manipulation.

(Incompatible) Removals
-----------------------------

- py.test.config is now only available if you are in a test run.

- the following (mostly already deprecated) functionality was removed:

  - removed support for Module/Class/... collection node definitions
    in conftest.py files.  They will cause nothing special.
  - removed support for calling the pre-1.0 collection API of "run()" and "join"
  - removed reading option values from conftest.py files or env variables.
    This can now be done much, much, better and easier through the ini-file
    mechanism and the "addopts" entry in particular.
  - removed the "disabled" attribute in test classes.  Use the skipping
    and pytestmark mechanism to skip or xfail a test class.

- py.test.collect.Directory does not exist anymore and it
  is not possible to provide an own "Directory" object.
  If you have used this and don't know what to do, get
  in contact.  We'll figure something out.

  Note that pytest_collect_directory() is still called but
  any return value will be ignored.  This allows to keep
  old code working that performed for example "py.test.skip()"
  in collect() to prevent recursion into directory trees
  if a certain dependency or command line option is missing.


see :ref:`changelog` for more detailed changes.

py.test 2.0.1: bug fixes
===========================================================================

Welcome to pytest-2.0.1, a maintenance and bug fix release of pytest,
a mature testing tool for Python, supporting CPython 2.4-3.2, Jython
and latest PyPy interpreters.  See extensive docs with tested examples here:

    http://pytest.org/

If you want to install or upgrade pytest, just type one of::

    pip install -U pytest # or
    easy_install -U pytest

Many thanks to all issue reporters and people asking questions or
complaining.  Particular thanks to Floris Bruynooghe and Ronny Pfannschmidt
for their great coding contributions and many others for feedback and help.

Changes between 2.0.0 and 2.0.1
----------------------------------------------

- refine and unify initial capturing so that it works nicely
  even if the logging module is used on an early-loaded conftest.py
  file or plugin.
- fix issue12 - show plugin versions with "--version" and
  "--traceconfig" and also document how to add extra information
  to reporting test header
- fix issue17 (import-* reporting issue on python3) by
  requiring py>1.4.0 (1.4.1 is going to include it)
- fix issue10 (numpy arrays truth checking) by refining
  assertion interpretation in py lib
- fix issue15: make nose compatibility tests compatible
  with python3 (now that nose-1.0 supports python3)
- remove somewhat surprising "same-conftest" detection because
  it ignores conftest.py when they appear in several subdirs.
- improve assertions ("not in"), thanks Floris Bruynooghe
- improve behaviour/warnings when running on top of "python -OO"
  (assertions and docstrings are turned off, leading to potential
  false positives)
- introduce a pytest_cmdline_processargs(args) hook
  to allow dynamic computation of command line arguments.
  This fixes a regression because py.test prior to 2.0
  allowed to set command line options from conftest.py
  files which so far pytest-2.0 only allowed from ini-files now.
- fix issue7: assert failures in doctest modules.
  unexpected failures in doctests will not generally
  show nicer, i.e. within the doctest failing context.
- fix issue9: setup/teardown functions for an xfail-marked
  test will report as xfail if they fail but report as normally
  passing (not xpassing) if they succeed.  This only is true
  for "direct" setup/teardown invocations because teardown_class/
  teardown_module cannot closely relate to a single test.
- fix issue14: no logging errors at process exit
- refinements to "collecting" output on non-ttys
- refine internal plugin registration and --traceconfig output
- introduce a mechanism to prevent/unregister plugins from the
  command line, see http://pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/plugins.html#cmdunregister
- activate resultlog plugin by default
- fix regression wrt yielded tests which due to the
  collection-before-running semantics were not
  setup as with pytest 1.3.4.  Note, however, that
  the recommended and much cleaner way to do test
  parametrization remains the "pytest_generate_tests"
  mechanism, see the docs.

py.test 2.0.2: bug fixes, improved xfail/skip expressions, speed ups
===========================================================================

Welcome to pytest-2.0.2, a maintenance and bug fix release of pytest,
a mature testing tool for Python, supporting CPython 2.4-3.2, Jython
and latest PyPy interpreters.  See the extensive docs with tested examples here:

    http://pytest.org/

If you want to install or upgrade pytest, just type one of::

    pip install -U pytest # or
    easy_install -U pytest

Many thanks to all issue reporters and people asking questions
or complaining, particularly Jurko for his insistence,
Laura, Victor and Brianna for helping with improving
and Ronny for his general advise.

best,
holger krekel

Changes between 2.0.1 and 2.0.2
----------------------------------------------

- tackle issue32 - speed up test runs of very quick test functions
  by reducing the relative overhead

- fix issue30 - extended xfail/skipif handling and improved reporting.
  If you have a syntax error in your skip/xfail
  expressions you now get nice error reports.

  Also you can now access module globals from xfail/skipif
  expressions so that this for example works now::

    import pytest
    import mymodule
    @pytest.mark.skipif("mymodule.__version__[0] == "1")
    def test_function():
        pass

  This will not run the test function if the module's version string
  does not start with a "1".  Note that specifying a string instead
  of a boolean expressions allows py.test to report meaningful information
  when summarizing a test run as to what conditions lead to skipping
  (or xfail-ing) tests.

- fix issue28 - setup_method and pytest_generate_tests work together
  The setup_method fixture method now gets called also for
  test function invocations generated from the pytest_generate_tests
  hook.

- fix issue27 - collectonly and keyword-selection (-k) now work together
  Also, if you do "py.test --collectonly -q" you now get a flat list
  of test ids that you can use to paste to the py.test commandline
  in order to execute a particular test.

- fix issue25 avoid reported problems with --pdb and python3.2/encodings output

- fix issue23 - tmpdir argument now works on Python3.2 and WindowsXP
  Starting with Python3.2 os.symlink may be supported. By requiring
  a newer py lib version the py.path.local() implementation acknowledges
  this.

- fixed typos in the docs (thanks Victor Garcia, Brianna Laugher) and particular
  thanks to Laura Creighton who also reviewed parts of the documentation.

- fix slightly wrong output of verbose progress reporting for classes
  (thanks Amaury)

- more precise (avoiding of) deprecation warnings for node.Class|Function accesses

- avoid std unittest assertion helper code in tracebacks (thanks Ronny)

  deriving from object.

- don't require zlib (and other libs) for genscript plugin without
  --genscript actually being used.

py.test 2.1.0: perfected assertions and bug fixes
===========================================================================

Welcome to the release of pytest-2.1, a mature testing tool for Python,
supporting CPython 2.4-3.2, Jython and latest PyPy interpreters.  See
the improved extensive docs (now also as PDF!) with tested examples here:

     http://pytest.org/

The single biggest news about this release are **perfected assertions**
courtesy of Benjamin Peterson.  You can now safely use ``assert``
statements in test modules without having to worry about side effects
or python optimization ("-OO") options.  This is achieved by rewriting
assert statements in test modules upon import, using a PEP302 hook.
See https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/assert.html for
detailed information.  The work has been partly sponsored by my company,
merlinux GmbH.

For further details on bug fixes and smaller enhancements see below.

If you want to install or upgrade pytest, just type one of::

    pip install -U pytest # or
    easy_install -U pytest

best,
holger krekel / https://merlinux.eu/

Changes between 2.0.3 and 2.1.0
----------------------------------------------

- fix issue53 call nosestyle setup functions with correct ordering
- fix issue58 and issue59: new assertion code fixes
- merge Benjamin's assertionrewrite branch: now assertions
  for test modules on python 2.6 and above are done by rewriting
  the AST and saving the pyc file before the test module is imported.
  see doc/assert.txt for more info.
- fix issue43: improve doctests with better traceback reporting on
  unexpected exceptions
- fix issue47: timing output in junitxml for test cases is now correct
- fix issue48: typo in MarkInfo repr leading to exception
- fix issue49: avoid confusing error when initialization partially fails
- fix issue44: env/username expansion for junitxml file path
- show releaselevel information in test runs for pypy
- reworked doc pages for better navigation and PDF generation
- report KeyboardInterrupt even if interrupted during session startup
- fix issue 35 - provide PDF doc version and download link from index page

py.test 2.2.0: test marking++, parametrization++ and duration profiling
===========================================================================

pytest-2.2.0 is a test-suite compatible release of the popular
py.test testing tool.  Plugins might need upgrades. It comes
with these improvements:

* easier and more powerful parametrization of tests:

  - new @pytest.mark.parametrize decorator to run tests with different arguments
  - new metafunc.parametrize() API for parametrizing arguments independently
  - see examples at http://pytest.org/en/stable/example/how-to/parametrize.html
  - NOTE that parametrize() related APIs are still a bit experimental
    and might change in future releases.

* improved handling of test markers and refined marking mechanism:

  - "-m markexpr" option for selecting tests according to their mark
  - a new "markers" ini-variable for registering test markers for your project
  - the new "--strict" bails out with an error if using unregistered markers.
  - see examples at http://pytest.org/en/stable/example/markers.html

* duration profiling: new "--duration=N" option showing the N slowest test
  execution or setup/teardown calls. This is most useful if you want to
  find out where your slowest test code is.

* also 2.2.0 performs more eager calling of teardown/finalizers functions
  resulting in better and more accurate reporting when they fail

Besides there is the usual set of bug fixes along with a cleanup of
pytest's own test suite allowing it to run on a wider range of environments.

For general information, see extensive docs with examples here:

     http://pytest.org/

If you want to install or upgrade pytest you might just type::

    pip install -U pytest # or
    easy_install -U pytest

Thanks to Ronny Pfannschmidt, David Burns, Jeff Donner, Daniel Nouri, Alfredo Deza and all who gave feedback or sent bug reports.

best,
holger krekel


notes on incompatibility
------------------------------

While test suites should work unchanged you might need to upgrade plugins:

* You need a new version of the pytest-xdist plugin (1.7) for distributing
  test runs.

* Other plugins might need an upgrade if they implement
  the ``pytest_runtest_logreport`` hook which now is called unconditionally
  for the setup/teardown fixture phases of a test. You may choose to
  ignore setup/teardown failures by inserting "if rep.when != 'call': return"
  or something similar. Note that most code probably "just" works because
  the hook was already called for failing setup/teardown phases of a test
  so a plugin should have been ready to grok such reports already.


Changes between 2.1.3 and 2.2.0
----------------------------------------

- fix issue90: introduce eager tearing down of test items so that
  teardown function are called earlier.
- add an all-powerful metafunc.parametrize function which allows to
  parametrize test function arguments in multiple steps and therefore
  from independent plugins and places.
- add a @pytest.mark.parametrize helper which allows to easily
  call a test function with different argument values.
- Add examples to the "parametrize" example page, including a quick port
  of Test scenarios and the new parametrize function and decorator.
- introduce registration for "pytest.mark.*" helpers via ini-files
  or through plugin hooks.  Also introduce a "--strict" option which
  will treat unregistered markers as errors
  allowing to avoid typos and maintain a well described set of markers
  for your test suite.  See examples at http://pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/mark.html
  and its links.
- issue50: introduce "-m marker" option to select tests based on markers
  (this is a stricter and more predictable version of "-k" in that "-m"
  only matches complete markers and has more obvious rules for and/or
  semantics.
- new feature to help optimizing the speed of your tests:
  --durations=N option for displaying N slowest test calls
  and setup/teardown methods.
- fix issue87: --pastebin now works with python3
- fix issue89: --pdb with unexpected exceptions in doctest work more sensibly
- fix and cleanup pytest's own test suite to not leak FDs
- fix issue83: link to generated funcarg list
- fix issue74: pyarg module names are now checked against imp.find_module false positives
- fix compatibility with twisted/trial-11.1.0 use cases

  instead of waiting for the end of the session. Thanks Dave Hunt for
  the good reporting and feedback.  The pytest_runtest_protocol as well
  as the pytest_runtest_teardown hooks now have "nextitem" available

pytest-2.3: improved fixtures / better unittest integration
=============================================================================

pytest-2.3 comes with many major improvements for fixture/funcarg management
and parametrized testing in Python.  It is now easier, more efficient and
more predictable to re-run the same tests with different fixture
instances.  Also, you can directly declare the caching "scope" of
fixtures so that dependent tests throughout your whole test suite can
reuse database or other expensive fixture objects with ease.  Lastly,
it's possible for fixture functions (formerly known as funcarg
factories) to use other fixtures, allowing for a completely modular and
reusable fixture design.

For detailed info and tutorial-style examples, see:

    http://pytest.org/en/stable/explanation/fixtures.html

Moreover, there is now support for using pytest fixtures/funcargs with
unittest-style suites, see here for examples:

    http://pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/unittest.html

Besides, more unittest-test suites are now expected to "simply work"
with pytest.

All changes are backward compatible and you should be able to continue
to run your test suites and 3rd party plugins that worked with
pytest-2.2.4.

If you are interested in the precise reasoning (including examples) of the
pytest-2.3 fixture evolution, please consult
http://pytest.org/en/stable/funcarg_compare.html

Particular thanks for this release go to Floris Bruynooghe, Alex Okrushko
Carl Meyer, Ronny Pfannschmidt, Benjamin Peterson and Alex Gaynor for helping
to get the new features right and well integrated.  Ronny and Floris
also helped to fix a number of bugs and yet more people helped by
providing bug reports.

Changes between 2.2.4 and 2.3.0
-----------------------------------

- fix issue202 - better automatic names for parametrized test functions
- fix issue139 - introduce @pytest.fixture which allows direct scoping
  and parametrization of funcarg factories.  Introduce new @pytest.setup
  marker to allow the writing of setup functions which accept funcargs.
- fix issue198 - conftest fixtures were not found on windows32 in some
  circumstances with nested directory structures due to path manipulation issues
- fix issue193 skip test functions with were parametrized with empty
  parameter sets
- fix python3.3 compat, mostly reporting bits that previously depended
  on dict ordering
- introduce re-ordering of tests by resource and parametrization setup
  which takes precedence to the usual file-ordering
- fix issue185 monkeypatching time.time does not cause pytest to fail
- fix issue172 duplicate call of pytest.setup-decoratored setup_module
  functions
- fix junitxml=path construction so that if tests change the
  current working directory and the path is a relative path
  it is constructed correctly from the original current working dir.
- fix "python setup.py test" example to cause a proper "errno" return
- fix issue165 - fix broken doc links and mention stackoverflow for FAQ
- catch unicode-issues when writing failure representations
  to terminal to prevent the whole session from crashing
- fix xfail/skip confusion: a skip-mark or an imperative pytest.skip
  will now take precedence before xfail-markers because we
  can't determine xfail/xpass status in case of a skip. see also:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11105828/in-py-test-when-i-explicitly-skip-a-test-that-is-marked-as-xfail-how-can-i-get

- always report installed 3rd party plugins in the header of a test run

- fix issue160: a failing setup of an xfail-marked tests should
  be reported as xfail (not xpass)

- fix issue128: show captured output when capsys/capfd are used

- fix issue179: properly show the dependency chain of factories

- pluginmanager.register(...) now raises ValueError if the
  plugin has been already registered or the name is taken

- fix issue159: improve https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.0.1/faq.html
  especially with respect to the "magic" history, also mention
  pytest-django, trial and unittest integration.

- make request.keywords and node.keywords writable.  All descendant
  collection nodes will see keyword values.  Keywords are dictionaries
  containing markers and other info.

- fix issue 178: xml binary escapes are now wrapped in py.xml.raw

- fix issue 176: correctly catch the builtin AssertionError
  even when we replaced AssertionError with a subclass on the
  python level

- factory discovery no longer fails with magic global callables
  that provide no sane __code__ object (mock.call for example)

- fix issue 182: testdir.inprocess_run now considers passed plugins

- fix issue 188: ensure sys.exc_info is clear on python2
                 before calling into a test

- fix issue 191: add unittest TestCase runTest method support
- fix issue 156: monkeypatch correctly handles class level descriptors

- reporting refinements:

  - pytest_report_header now receives a "startdir" so that
    you can use startdir.bestrelpath(yourpath) to show
    nice relative path

  - allow plugins to implement both pytest_report_header and
    pytest_sessionstart (sessionstart is invoked first).

  - don't show deselected reason line if there is none

  - py.test -vv will show all of assert comparisons instead of truncating

and deep customization for testing with Python.  Particularly,
this release provides:

- integration fixes and improvements related to flask, numpy, nose,
  unittest, mock

- makes pytest work on py24 again (yes, people sometimes still need to use it)

- show ``*,**`` args in pytest tracebacks

Thanks to Manuel Jacob, Thomas Waldmann, Ronny Pfannschmidt, Pavel Repin
and Andreas Taumoefolau for providing patches and all for the issues.

Changes between 2.3.2 and 2.3.3
-----------------------------------

- fix issue214 - parse modules that contain special objects like e. g.
  flask's request object which blows up on getattr access if no request
  is active. thanks Thomas Waldmann.

- fix issue213 - allow to parametrize with values like numpy arrays that
  do not support an __eq__ operator

- fix issue215 - split test_python.org into multiple files

- fix issue148 - @unittest.skip on classes is now recognized and avoids
  calling setUpClass/tearDownClass, thanks Pavel Repin

- fix issue209 - reintroduce python2.4 support by depending on newer
  pylib which re-introduced statement-finding for pre-AST interpreters

- nose support: only call setup if it's a callable, thanks Andrew
  Taumoefolau

- fix issue219 - add py2.4-3.3 classifiers to TROVE list

- in tracebacks *,** arg values are now shown next to normal arguments
  (thanks Manuel Jacob)

- fix issue217 - support mock.patch with pytest's fixtures - note that
  you need either mock-1.0.1 or the python3.3 builtin unittest.mock.

- fix issue127 - improve documentation for pytest_addoption() and
  add a ``config.getoption(name)`` helper function for consistency.

pytest-2.3.4: stabilization, more flexible selection via "-k expr"
===========================================================================

pytest-2.3.4 is a small stabilization release of the py.test tool
which offers uebersimple assertions, scalable fixture mechanisms
and deep customization for testing with Python.  This release
comes with the following fixes and features:

- make "-k" option accept an expressions the same as with "-m" so that one
  can write: -k "name1 or name2" etc.  This is a slight usage incompatibility
  if you used special syntax like "TestClass.test_method" which you now
  need to write as -k "TestClass and test_method" to match a certain
  method in a certain test class.
- allow to dynamically define markers via
  item.keywords[...]=assignment integrating with "-m" option
- yielded test functions will now have autouse-fixtures active but
  cannot accept fixtures as funcargs - it's anyway recommended to
  rather use the post-2.0 parametrize features instead of yield, see:
  http://pytest.org/en/stable/example/how-to/parametrize.html
- fix autouse-issue where autouse-fixtures would not be discovered
  if defined in an a/conftest.py file and tests in a/tests/test_some.py
- fix issue226 - LIFO ordering for fixture teardowns
- fix issue224 - invocations with >256 char arguments now work
- fix issue91 - add/discuss package/directory level setups in example
- fixes related to autouse discovery and calling

Thanks in particular to Thomas Waldmann for spotting and reporting issues.

pytest-2.3.5: bug fixes and little improvements
===========================================================================

pytest-2.3.5 is a maintenance release with many bug fixes and little
improvements.  See the changelog below for details.  No backward
compatibility issues are foreseen and all plugins which worked with the
prior version are expected to work unmodified.   Speaking of which, a
few interesting new plugins saw the light last month:

- pytest-instafail: show failure information while tests are running
- pytest-qt: testing of GUI applications written with QT/Pyside
- pytest-xprocess: managing external processes across test runs
- pytest-random: randomize test ordering

And several others like pytest-django saw maintenance releases.
For a more complete list, check out

To install or upgrade pytest:

    pip install -U pytest # or
    easy_install -U pytest

Particular thanks to Floris, Ronny, Benjamin and the many bug reporters
and fix providers.

Changes between 2.3.4 and 2.3.5
-----------------------------------

- never consider a fixture function for test function collection

- allow re-running of test items / helps to fix pytest-reruntests plugin
  and also help to keep less fixture/resource references alive

- put captured stdout/stderr into junitxml output even for passing tests
  (thanks Adam Goucher)

- Issue 265 - integrate nose setup/teardown with setupstate
  so it doesn't try to teardown if it did not setup

- issue 271 - don't write junitxml on worker nodes

- Issue 274 - don't try to show full doctest example
  when doctest does not know the example location

- issue 280 - disable assertion rewriting on buggy CPython 2.6.0

- inject "getfixture()" helper to retrieve fixtures from doctests,
  thanks Andreas Zeidler

- issue 259 - when assertion rewriting, be consistent with the default
  source encoding of ASCII on Python 2

- issue 251 - report a skip instead of ignoring classes with init

- issue250 unicode/str mixes in parametrization names and values now works

- issue257, assertion-triggered compilation of source ending in a
  comment line doesn't blow up in python2.5 (fixed through py>=1.4.13.dev6)

- fix --genscript option to generate standalone scripts that also
  work with python3.3 (importer ordering)

- issue171 - in assertion rewriting, show the repr of some
  global variables

- fix option help for "-k"

- move long description of distribution into README.rst

- improve docstring for metafunc.parametrize()

- fix bug where using capsys with pytest.set_trace() in a test
  function would break when looking at capsys.readouterr()

- allow to specify prefixes starting with "_" when
  customizing python_functions test discovery. (thanks Graham Horler)

- improve PYTEST_DEBUG tracing output by putting
  extra data on a new lines with additional indent

- ensure OutcomeExceptions like skip/fail have initialized exception attributes

- issue 260 - don't use nose special setup on plain unittest cases

- fix issue134 - print the collect errors that prevent running specified test items

- fix issue266 - accept unicode in MarkEvaluator expressions

pytest-2.4.0: new fixture features/hooks and bug fixes
===========================================================================

The just released pytest-2.4.0 brings many improvements and numerous
bug fixes while remaining plugin- and test-suite compatible apart
from a few supposedly very minor incompatibilities.  See below for
a full list of details.  A few feature highlights:

- new yield-style fixtures `pytest.yield_fixture
  <http://pytest.org/en/stable/yieldfixture.html>`_, allowing to use
  existing with-style context managers in fixture functions.

- improved pdb support: ``import pdb ; pdb.set_trace()`` now works
  without requiring prior disabling of stdout/stderr capturing.
  Also the ``--pdb`` options works now on collection and internal errors
  and we introduced a new experimental hook for IDEs/plugins to
  intercept debugging: ``pytest_exception_interact(node, call, report)``.

- shorter monkeypatch variant to allow specifying an import path as
  a target, for example: ``monkeypatch.setattr("requests.get", myfunc)``

- better unittest/nose compatibility: all teardown methods are now only
  called if the corresponding setup method succeeded.

- integrate tab-completion on command line options if you
  have :pypi:`argcomplete` configured.

- allow boolean expression directly with skipif/xfail
  if a "reason" is also specified.

- a new hook ``pytest_load_initial_conftests`` allows plugins like
  :pypi:`pytest-django` to
  influence the environment before conftest files import ``django``.

- reporting: color the last line red or green depending if
  failures/errors occurred or everything passed.

The documentation has been updated to accommodate the changes,
see `http://pytest.org <http://pytest.org>`_

To install or upgrade pytest::

    pip install -U pytest # or
    easy_install -U pytest

may passing tests be with you,

holger krekel

Changes between 2.3.5 and 2.4
-----------------------------------

known incompatibilities:

- if calling --genscript from python2.7 or above, you only get a
  standalone script which works on python2.7 or above.  Use Python2.6
  to also get a python2.5 compatible version.

- all xunit-style teardown methods (nose-style, pytest-style,
  unittest-style) will not be called if the corresponding setup method failed,
  see issue322 below.

- the pytest_plugin_unregister hook wasn't ever properly called
  and there is no known implementation of the hook - so it got removed.

- pytest.fixture-decorated functions cannot be generators (i.e. use
  yield) anymore.  This change might be reversed in 2.4.1 if it causes
  unforeseen real-life issues.  However, you can always write and return
  an inner function/generator and change the fixture consumer to iterate
  over the returned generator.  This change was done in lieu of the new
  ``pytest.yield_fixture`` decorator, see below.

new features:

- experimentally introduce a new ``pytest.yield_fixture`` decorator
  which accepts exactly the same parameters as pytest.fixture but
  mandates a ``yield`` statement instead of a ``return statement`` from
  fixture functions.  This allows direct integration with "with-style"
  context managers in fixture functions and generally avoids registering
  of finalization callbacks in favour of treating the "after-yield" as
  teardown code.  Thanks Andreas Pelme, Vladimir Keleshev, Floris
  Bruynooghe, Ronny Pfannschmidt and many others for discussions.

- allow boolean expression directly with skipif/xfail
  if a "reason" is also specified.  Rework skipping documentation
  to recommend "condition as booleans" because it prevents surprises
  when importing markers between modules.  Specifying conditions
  as strings will remain fully supported.

- reporting: color the last line red or green depending if
  failures/errors occurred or everything passed.  thanks Christian
  Theunert.

- make "import pdb ; pdb.set_trace()" work natively wrt capturing (no
  "-s" needed anymore), making ``pytest.set_trace()`` a mere shortcut.

- fix issue181: --pdb now also works on collect errors (and
  on internal errors) .  This was implemented by a slight internal
  refactoring and the introduction of a new hook
  ``pytest_exception_interact`` hook (see next item).

- fix issue341: introduce new experimental hook for IDEs/terminals to
  intercept debugging: ``pytest_exception_interact(node, call, report)``.

- new monkeypatch.setattr() variant to provide a shorter
  invocation for patching out classes/functions from modules:

     monkeypatch.setattr("requests.get", myfunc)

  will replace the "get" function of the "requests" module with ``myfunc``.

- fix issue322: tearDownClass is not run if setUpClass failed. Thanks
  Mathieu Agopian for the initial fix.  Also make all of pytest/nose
  finalizer mimic the same generic behaviour: if a setupX exists and
  fails, don't run teardownX.  This internally introduces a new method
  "node.addfinalizer()" helper which can only be called during the setup
  phase of a node.

- simplify pytest.mark.parametrize() signature: allow to pass a
  CSV-separated string to specify argnames.  For example:
  ``pytest.mark.parametrize("input,expected",  [(1,2), (2,3)])``
  works as well as the previous:
  ``pytest.mark.parametrize(("input", "expected"), ...)``.

- add support for setUpModule/tearDownModule detection, thanks Brian Okken.

- integrate tab-completion on options through use of "argcomplete".
  Thanks Anthon van der Neut for the PR.

- change option names to be hyphen-separated long options but keep the
  old spelling backward compatible.  py.test -h will only show the
  hyphenated version, for example "--collect-only" but "--collectonly"
  will remain valid as well (for backward-compat reasons).  Many thanks to
  Anthon van der Neut for the implementation and to Hynek Schlawack for
  pushing us.

- fix issue 308 - allow to mark/xfail/skip individual parameter sets
  when parametrizing.  Thanks Brianna Laugher.

- call new experimental pytest_load_initial_conftests hook to allow
  3rd party plugins to do something before a conftest is loaded.

Bug fixes:

- fix issue358 - capturing options are now parsed more properly
  by using a new parser.parse_known_args method.

- pytest now uses argparse instead of optparse (thanks Anthon) which
  means that "argparse" is added as a dependency if installing into python2.6
  environments or below.

- fix issue333: fix a case of bad unittest/pytest hook interaction.

- PR27: correctly handle nose.SkipTest during collection.  Thanks
  Antonio Cuni, Ronny Pfannschmidt.

- fix issue355: junitxml puts name="pytest" attribute to testsuite tag.

- fix issue336: autouse fixture in plugins should work again.

- fix issue279: improve object comparisons on assertion failure
  for standard datatypes and recognise collections.abc.  Thanks to
  Brianna Laugher and Mathieu Agopian.

- fix issue317: assertion rewriter support for the is_package method

- fix issue335: document py.code.ExceptionInfo() object returned
  from pytest.raises(), thanks Mathieu Agopian.

- remove implicit distribute_setup support from setup.py.

- fix issue305: ignore any problems when writing pyc files.

- SO-17664702: call fixture finalizers even if the fixture function
  partially failed (finalizers would not always be called before)

- fix issue320 - fix class scope for fixtures when mixed with
  module-level functions.  Thanks Anatoly Bubenkoff.

- you can specify "-q" or "-qq" to get different levels of "quieter"
  reporting (thanks Katarzyna Jachim)

- fix issue300 - Fix order of conftest loading when starting py.test
  in a subdirectory.

- fix issue323 - sorting of many module-scoped arg parametrizations

- make sessionfinish hooks execute with the same cwd-context as at
  session start (helps fix plugin behaviour which write output files
  with relative path such as pytest-cov)

- fix issue316 - properly reference collection hooks in docs

- fix issue 306 - cleanup of -k/-m options to only match markers/test
  names/keywords respectively.  Thanks Wouter van Ackooy.

- improved doctest counting for doctests in python modules --
  files without any doctest items will not show up anymore
  and doctest examples are counted as separate test items.
  thanks Danilo Bellini.

- fix issue245 by depending on the released py-1.4.14
  which fixes py.io.dupfile to work with files with no
  mode. Thanks Jason R. Coombs.

- fix junitxml generation when test output contains control characters,
  addressing issue267, thanks Jaap Broekhuizen

- fix issue338: honor --tb style for setup/teardown errors as well.  Thanks Maho.

- fix issue307 - use yaml.safe_load in example, thanks Mark Eichin.

- better parametrize error messages, thanks Brianna Laugher

- pytest_terminal_summary(terminalreporter) hooks can now use
  ".section(title)" and ".line(msg)" methods to print extra
  information at the end of a test run.

pytest-2.4.1: fixing three regressions compared to 2.3.5
===========================================================================

pytest-2.4.1 is a quick follow up release to fix three regressions
compared to 2.3.5 before they hit more people:

- When using parser.addoption() unicode arguments to the
  "type" keyword should also be converted to the respective types.
  thanks Floris Bruynooghe, @dnozay. (fixes issue360 and issue362)

- fix dotted filename completion when using argcomplete
  thanks Anthon van der Neuth. (fixes issue361)

- fix regression when a 1-tuple ("arg",) is used for specifying
  parametrization (the values of the parametrization were passed
  nested in a tuple).  Thanks Donald Stufft.

- also merge doc typo fixes, thanks Andy Dirnberger

pytest-2.4.2: colorama on windows, plugin/tmpdir fixes
===========================================================================

pytest-2.4.2 is another bug-fixing release:

- on Windows require colorama and a newer py lib so that py.io.TerminalWriter()
  now uses colorama instead of its own ctypes hacks. (fixes issue365)
  thanks Paul Moore for bringing it up.

- fix "-k" matching of tests where "repr" and "attr" and other names would
  cause wrong matches because of an internal implementation quirk
  (don't ask) which is now properly implemented. fixes issue345.

- avoid tmpdir fixture to create too long filenames especially
  when parametrization is used (issue354)

- fix pytest-pep8 and pytest-flakes / pytest interactions
  (collection names in mark plugin was assuming an item always
  has a function which is not true for those plugins etc.)
  Thanks Andi Zeidler.

- introduce node.get_marker/node.add_marker API for plugins
  like pytest-pep8 and pytest-flakes to avoid the messy
  details of the node.keywords  pseudo-dicts.  Adapted
  docs.

- remove attempt to "dup" stdout at startup as it's icky.
  the normal capturing should catch enough possibilities
  of tests messing up standard FDs.

- add pluginmanager.do_configure(config) as a link to
  config.do_configure() for plugin-compatibility

pytest-2.5.0: now down to ZERO reported bugs!
===========================================================================

pytest-2.5.0 is a big fixing release, the result of two community bug
fixing days plus numerous additional works from many people and
reporters.  The release should be fully compatible to 2.4.2, existing
plugins and test suites.  We aim at maintaining this level of ZERO reported
bugs because it's no fun if your testing tool has bugs, is it?  Under a
condition, though: when submitting a bug report please provide
clear information about the circumstances and a simple example which
reproduces the problem.

The issue tracker is of course not empty now.  We have many remaining
"enhancement" issues which we'll hopefully can tackle in 2014 with your
help.

For those who use older Python versions, please note that pytest is not
automatically tested on python2.5 due to virtualenv, setuptools and tox
not supporting it anymore.  Manual verification shows that it mostly
works fine but it's not going to be part of the automated release
process and thus likely to break in the future.

As usual, current docs are at

    http://pytest.org

and you can upgrade from pypi via::

    pip install -U pytest

Particular thanks for helping with this release go to Anatoly Bubenkoff,
Floris Bruynooghe, Marc Abramowitz, Ralph Schmitt, Ronny Pfannschmidt,
Donald Stufft, James Lan, Rob Dennis, Jason R. Coombs, Mathieu Agopian,
Virgil Dupras, Bruno Oliveira, Alex Gaynor and others.

2.5.0
-----------------------------------

- dropped python2.5 from automated release testing of pytest itself
  which means it's probably going to break soon (but still works
  with this release we believe).

- simplified and fixed implementation for calling finalizers when
  parametrized fixtures or function arguments are involved.  finalization
  is now performed lazily at setup time instead of in the "teardown phase".
  While this might sound odd at first, it helps to ensure that we are
  correctly handling setup/teardown even in complex code.  User-level code
  should not be affected unless it's implementing the pytest_runtest_teardown
  hook and expecting certain fixture instances are torn down within (very
  unlikely and would have been unreliable anyway).

- PR90: add --color=yes|no|auto option to force terminal coloring
  mode ("auto" is default).  Thanks Marc Abramowitz.

- fix issue319 - correctly show unicode in assertion errors.  Many
  thanks to Floris Bruynooghe for the complete PR.  Also means
  we depend on py>=1.4.19 now.

- fix issue396 - correctly sort and finalize class-scoped parametrized
  tests independently from number of methods on the class.

- refix issue323 in a better way -- parametrization should now never
  cause Runtime Recursion errors because the underlying algorithm
  for re-ordering tests per-scope/per-fixture is not recursive
  anymore (it was tail-call recursive before which could lead
  to problems for more than >966 non-function scoped parameters).

- fix issue290 - there is preliminary support now for parametrizing
  with repeated same values (sometimes useful to test if calling
  a second time works as with the first time).

- close issue240 - document precisely how pytest module importing
  works, discuss the two common test directory layouts, and how it
  interacts with PEP420-namespace packages.

- fix issue246 fix finalizer order to be LIFO on independent fixtures
  depending on a parametrized higher-than-function scoped fixture.
  (was quite some effort so please bear with the complexity of this sentence :)
  Thanks Ralph Schmitt for the precise failure example.

- fix issue244 by implementing special index for parameters to only use
  indices for parametrized test ids

- fix issue287 by running all finalizers but saving the exception
  from the first failing finalizer and re-raising it so teardown will
  still have failed.  We reraise the first failing exception because
  it might be the cause for other finalizers to fail.

- fix ordering when mock.patch or other standard decorator-wrappings
  are used with test methods.  This fixes issue346 and should
  help with random "xdist" collection failures.  Thanks to
  Ronny Pfannschmidt and Donald Stufft for helping to isolate it.

- fix issue357 - special case "-k" expressions to allow for
  filtering with simple strings that are not valid python expressions.
  Examples: "-k 1.3" matches all tests parametrized with 1.3.
  "-k None" filters all tests that have "None" in their name
  and conversely "-k 'not None'".
  Previously these examples would raise syntax errors.

- fix issue384 by removing the trial support code
  since the unittest compat enhancements allow
  trial to handle it on its own

- don't hide an ImportError when importing a plugin produces one.
  fixes issue375.

- fix issue275 - allow usefixtures and autouse fixtures
  for running doctest text files.

- fix issue380 by making --resultlog only rely on longrepr instead
  of the "reprcrash" attribute which only exists sometimes.

- address issue122: allow @pytest.fixture(params=iterator) by exploding
  into a list early on.

- fix pexpect-3.0 compatibility for pytest's own tests.
  (fixes issue386)

- allow nested parametrize-value markers, thanks James Lan for the PR.

- fix unicode handling with new monkeypatch.setattr(import_path, value)
  API.  Thanks Rob Dennis.  Fixes issue371.

- fix unicode handling with junitxml, fixes issue368.

- In assertion rewriting mode on Python 2, fix the detection of coding
  cookies. See issue #330.

- make "--runxfail" turn imperative pytest.xfail calls into no ops
  (it already did neutralize pytest.mark.xfail markers)

- refine pytest / pkg_resources interactions: The AssertionRewritingHook
  PEP302 compliant loader now registers itself with setuptools/pkg_resources
  properly so that the pkg_resources.resource_stream method works properly.
  Fixes issue366.  Thanks for the investigations and full PR to Jason R. Coombs.

- pytestconfig fixture is now session-scoped as it is the same object during the
  whole test run.  Fixes issue370.

- avoid one surprising case of marker malfunction/confusion::

      @pytest.mark.some(lambda arg: ...)
      def test_function():

  would not work correctly because pytest assumes @pytest.mark.some
  gets a function to be decorated already.  We now at least detect if this
  arg is a lambda and thus the example will work.  Thanks Alex Gaynor
  for bringing it up.

- xfail a test on pypy that checks wrong encoding/ascii (pypy does
  not error out). fixes issue385.

- internally make varnames() deal with classes's __init__,
  although it's not needed by pytest itself atm.  Also
  fix caching.  Fixes issue376.

- fix issue221 - handle importing of namespace-package with no
  __init__.py properly.

- refactor internal FixtureRequest handling to avoid monkeypatching.
  One of the positive user-facing effects is that the "request" object
  can now be used in closures.

- fixed version comparison in pytest.importskip(modname, minverstring)

- fix issue377 by clarifying in the nose-compat docs that pytest
  does not duplicate the unittest-API into the "plain" namespace.

- fix verbose reporting for @mock'd test functions

pytest-2.5.1: fixes and new home page styling
===========================================================================

pytest is a mature Python testing tool with more than 1000 tests
against itself, passing on many different interpreters and platforms.

The 2.5.1 release maintains the "zero-reported-bugs" promise by fixing
the three bugs reported since the last release a few days ago.  It also
features a new home page styling implemented by Tobias Bieniek, based on
the flask theme from Armin Ronacher:

    http://pytest.org

If you have anything more to improve styling and docs,
we'd be very happy to merge further pull requests.

On the coding side, the release also contains a little enhancement to
fixture decorators allowing to directly influence generation of test
ids, thanks to Floris Bruynooghe.  Other thanks for helping with
this release go to Anatoly Bubenkoff and Ronny Pfannschmidt.

As usual, you can upgrade from pypi via::

pytest-2.6.0: shorter tracebacks, new warning system, test runner compat
===========================================================================

pytest is a mature Python testing tool with more than 1000 tests
against itself, passing on many different interpreters and platforms.

The 2.6.0 release should be drop-in backward compatible to 2.5.2 and
fixes a number of bugs and brings some new features, mainly:

- shorter tracebacks by default: only the first (test function) entry
  and the last (failure location) entry are shown, the ones between
  only in "short" format.  Use ``--tb=long`` to get back the old
  behaviour of showing "long" entries everywhere.

- a new warning system which reports oddities during collection
  and execution.  For example, ignoring collecting Test* classes with an
  ``__init__`` now produces a warning.

- various improvements to nose/mock/unittest integration

Note also that 2.6.0 departs with the "zero reported bugs" policy
because it has been too hard to keep up with it, unfortunately.
Instead we are for now rather bound to work on "upvoted" issues in
the https://bitbucket.org/pytest-dev/pytest/issues?status=new&status=open&sort=-votes
issue tracker.

See docs at:

    http://pytest.org

As usual, you can upgrade from pypi via::

    pip install -U pytest

2.6.0
-----------------------------------

- fix issue537: Avoid importing old assertion reinterpretation code by default.
  Thanks Benjamin Peterson.

- fix issue364: shorten and enhance tracebacks representation by default.
  The new "--tb=auto" option (default) will only display long tracebacks
  for the first and last entry.  You can get the old behaviour of printing
  all entries as long entries with "--tb=long".  Also short entries by
  default are now printed very similarly to "--tb=native" ones.

- fix issue514: teach assertion reinterpretation about private class attributes
  Thanks Benjamin Peterson.

- change -v output to include full node IDs of tests.  Users can copy
  a node ID from a test run, including line number, and use it as a
  positional argument in order to run only a single test.

- fix issue 475: fail early and comprehensible if calling
  pytest.raises with wrong exception type.

- fix issue516: tell in getting-started about current dependencies.

- cleanup setup.py a bit and specify supported versions. Thanks Jurko
  Gospodnetic for the PR.

- change XPASS colour to yellow rather than red when tests are run
  with -v.

- fix issue473: work around mock putting an unbound method into a class
  dict when double-patching.

- fix issue498: if a fixture finalizer fails, make sure that
  the fixture is still invalidated.

- fix issue453: the result of the pytest_assertrepr_compare hook now gets
  it's newlines escaped so that format_exception does not blow up.

- internal new warning system: pytest will now produce warnings when
  it detects oddities in your test collection or execution.
  Warnings are ultimately sent to a new pytest_logwarning hook which is
  currently only implemented by the terminal plugin which displays
  warnings in the summary line and shows more details when -rw (report on
  warnings) is specified.

- change skips into warnings for test classes with an __init__ and
  callables in test modules which look like a test but are not functions.

- fix issue436: improved finding of initial conftest files from command
  line arguments by using the result of parse_known_args rather than
  the previous flaky heuristics.  Thanks Marc Abramowitz for tests
  and initial fixing approaches in this area.

- fix issue #479: properly handle nose/unittest(2) SkipTest exceptions
  during collection/loading of test modules.  Thanks to Marc Schlaich
  for the complete PR.

- fix issue490: include pytest_load_initial_conftests in documentation
  and improve docstring.

- fix issue472: clarify that ``pytest.config.getvalue()`` cannot work
  if it's triggered ahead of command line parsing.

- merge PR123: improved integration with mock.patch decorator on tests.

- fix issue412: messing with stdout/stderr FD-level streams is now
  captured without crashes.

- fix issue483: trial/py33 works now properly.  Thanks Daniel Grana for PR.

- improve example for pytest integration with "python setup.py test"
  which now has a generic "-a" or "--pytest-args" option where you
  can pass additional options as a quoted string.  Thanks Trevor Bekolay.

- simplified internal capturing mechanism and made it more robust
  against tests or setups changing FD1/FD2, also better integrated
  now with pytest.pdb() in single tests.

- improvements to pytest's own test-suite leakage detection, courtesy of PRs
  from Marc Abramowitz

- fix issue492: avoid leak in test_writeorg.  Thanks Marc Abramowitz.

- fix issue493: don't run tests in doc directory with ``python setup.py test``
  (use tox -e doctesting for that)

- fix issue486: better reporting and handling of early conftest loading failures

- some cleanup and simplification of internal conftest handling.

- work a bit harder to break reference cycles when catching exceptions.
  Thanks Jurko Gospodnetic.

- fix issue443: fix skip examples to use proper comparison.  Thanks Alex
  Groenholm.

- support nose-style ``__test__`` attribute on modules, classes and
  functions, including unittest-style Classes.  If set to False, the
  test will not be collected.

- fix issue512: show "<notset>" for arguments which might not be set
  in monkeypatch plugin.  Improves output in documentation.

- avoid importing "py.test" (an old alias module for "pytest")

pytest-2.6.1: fixes and new xfail feature
===========================================================================

pytest is a mature Python testing tool with more than 1100 tests
against itself, passing on many different interpreters and platforms.
The 2.6.1 release is drop-in compatible to 2.5.2 and actually fixes some
regressions introduced with 2.6.0.  It also brings a little feature
to the xfail marker which now recognizes expected exceptions,
see the CHANGELOG below.

See docs at:

    http://pytest.org

As usual, you can upgrade from pypi via::

    pip install -U pytest

Thanks to all who contributed, among them:

    Floris Bruynooghe
    Bruno Oliveira
    Nicolas Delaby

have fun,
holger krekel

Changes 2.6.1
=================

- No longer show line numbers in the --verbose output, the output is now
  purely the nodeid.  The line number is still shown in failure reports.
  Thanks Floris Bruynooghe.

- fix issue437 where assertion rewriting could cause pytest-xdist worker nodes
  to collect different tests. Thanks Bruno Oliveira.

- fix issue555: add "errors" attribute to capture-streams to satisfy
  some distutils and possibly other code accessing sys.stdout.errors.

- fix issue547 capsys/capfd also work when output capturing ("-s") is disabled.

- address issue170: allow pytest.mark.xfail(...) to specify expected exceptions via
  an optional "raises=EXC" argument where EXC can be a single exception
  or a tuple of exception classes.  Thanks David Mohr for the complete
  PR.

- fix integration of pytest with unittest.mock.patch decorator when
  it uses the "new" argument.  Thanks Nicolas Delaby for test and PR.

- fix issue with detecting conftest files if the arguments contain
  "::" node id specifications (copy pasted from "-v" output)

- fix issue544 by only removing "@NUM" at the end of "::" separated parts
  and if the part has a ".py" extension

- don't use py.std import helper, rather import things directly.
  Thanks Bruno Oliveira.

2.6.2
-----------

- Added function pytest.freeze_includes(), which makes it easy to embed
  pytest into executables using tools like cx_freeze.
  See docs for examples and rationale. Thanks Bruno Oliveira.

- Improve assertion rewriting cache invalidation precision.

- fixed issue561: adapt autouse fixture example for python3.

- fixed issue453: assertion rewriting issue with __repr__ containing
  "\n{", "\n}" and "\n~".

- fix issue560: correctly display code if an "else:" or "finally:" is
  followed by statements on the same line.

- Fix example in monkeypatch documentation, thanks t-8ch.

- fix issue572: correct tmpdir doc example for python3.

- Do not mark as universal wheel because Python 2.6 is different from
  other builds due to the extra argparse dependency.  Fixes issue566.
  Thanks sontek.

  Pfannschmidt.

- Fix infinite recursion bug when pickling capture.EncodedFile, thanks
  Uwe Schmitt.

- fix issue589: fix bad interaction with numpy and others when showing
  exceptions.  Check for precise "maximum recursion depth exceed" exception
  instead of presuming any RuntimeError is that one (implemented in py
  dep).  Thanks Charles Cloud for analysing the issue.

- fix conftest related fixture visibility issue: when running with a
  CWD outside of a test package pytest would get fixture discovery wrong.
  Thanks to Wolfgang Schnerring for figuring out a reproducible example.

- Introduce pytest_enter_pdb hook (needed e.g. by pytest_timeout to cancel the
  timeout when interactively entering pdb).  Thanks Wolfgang Schnerring.

- check xfail/skip also with non-python function test items. Thanks
  Floris Bruynooghe.

2.7.0 (compared to 2.6.4)
-----------------------------

- fix issue435: make reload() work when assert rewriting is active.
  Thanks Daniel Hahler.

- fix issue616: conftest.py files and their contained fixtures are now
  properly considered for visibility, independently from the exact
  current working directory and test arguments that are used.
  Many thanks to Eric Siegerman and his PR235 which contains
  systematic tests for conftest visibility and now passes.
  This change also introduces the concept of a ``rootdir`` which
  is printed as a new pytest header and documented in the pytest
  customize web page.

- change reporting of "diverted" tests, i.e. tests that are collected
  in one file but actually come from another (e.g. when tests in a test class
  come from a base class in a different file).  We now show the nodeid
  and indicate via a postfix the other file.

- add ability to set command line options by environment variable PYTEST_ADDOPTS.

- added documentation on the new pytest-dev teams on bitbucket and
  github.  See https://pytest.org/en/stable/contributing.html .
  Thanks to Anatoly for pushing and initial work on this.

- fix issue650: new option ``--doctest-ignore-import-errors`` which
  will turn import errors in doctests into skips.  Thanks Charles Cloud
  for the complete PR.

- fix issue655: work around different ways that cause python2/3
  to leak sys.exc_info into fixtures/tests causing failures in 3rd party code

- fix issue615: assertion rewriting did not correctly escape % signs
  when formatting boolean operations, which tripped over mixing
  booleans with modulo operators.  Thanks to Tom Viner for the report,
  triaging and fix.

- implement issue351: add ability to specify parametrize ids as a callable
  to generate custom test ids.  Thanks Brianna Laugher for the idea and
  implementation.

- introduce and document new hookwrapper mechanism useful for plugins
  which want to wrap the execution of certain hooks for their purposes.
  This supersedes the undocumented ``__multicall__`` protocol which
  pytest itself and some external plugins use.  Note that pytest-2.8
  is scheduled to drop supporting the old ``__multicall__``
  and only support the hookwrapper protocol.

- majorly speed up invocation of plugin hooks

- use hookwrapper mechanism in builtin pytest plugins.

- add a doctest ini option for doctest flags, thanks Holger Peters.

- add note to docs that if you want to mark a parameter and the
  parameter is a callable, you also need to pass in a reason to disambiguate
  it from the "decorator" case.  Thanks Tom Viner.

- "python_classes" and "python_functions" options now support glob-patterns
  for test discovery, as discussed in issue600. Thanks Ldiary Translations.

- allow to override parametrized fixtures with non-parametrized ones and vice versa (bubenkoff).

- fix issue463: raise specific error for 'parameterize' misspelling (pfctdayelise).

- On failure, the ``sys.last_value``, ``sys.last_type`` and
  ``sys.last_traceback`` are set, so that a user can inspect the error
  via postmortem debugging (almarklein).

Happy testing,
The py.test Development Team


2.9.0 (compared to 2.8.7)
-------------------------

**New Features**

* New ``pytest.mark.skip`` mark, which unconditionally skips marked tests.
  Thanks :user:`MichaelAquilina` for the complete PR (:pr:`1040`).

* ``--doctest-glob`` may now be passed multiple times in the command-line.
  Thanks :user:`jab` and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* New ``-rp`` and ``-rP`` reporting options give the summary and full output
  of passing tests, respectively. Thanks to :user:`codewarrior0` for the PR.

* ``pytest.mark.xfail`` now has a ``strict`` option which makes ``XPASS``
  tests to fail the test suite, defaulting to ``False``. There's also a
  ``xfail_strict`` ini option that can be used to configure it project-wise.
  Thanks :user:`rabbbit` for the request and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR (:issue:`1355`).

* ``Parser.addini`` now supports options of type ``bool``. Thanks
  :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* New ``ALLOW_BYTES`` doctest option strips ``b`` prefixes from byte strings
  in doctest output (similar to ``ALLOW_UNICODE``).
  Thanks :user:`jaraco` for the request and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR (:issue:`1287`).

* give a hint on KeyboardInterrupt to use the --fulltrace option to show the errors,
  this fixes :issue:`1366`.
  Thanks to :user:`hpk42` for the report and :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for the PR.

* catch IndexError exceptions when getting exception source location. This fixes
  pytest internal error for dynamically generated code (fixtures and tests)
  where source lines are fake by intention

**Changes**

* **Important**: `py.code <https://pylib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code.html>`_ has been
  merged into the ``pytest`` repository as ``pytest._code``. This decision
  was made because ``py.code`` had very few uses outside ``pytest`` and the
  fact that it was in a different repository made it difficult to fix bugs on
  its code in a timely manner. The team hopes with this to be able to better
  refactor out and improve that code.
  This change shouldn't affect users, but it is useful to let users aware
  if they encounter any strange behavior.

  Keep in mind that the code for ``pytest._code`` is **private** and
  **experimental**, so you definitely should not import it explicitly!

  Please note that the original ``py.code`` is still available in
  `pylib <https://pylib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.

* ``pytest_enter_pdb`` now optionally receives the pytest config object.
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Removed code and documentation for Python 2.5 or lower versions,
  including removal of the obsolete ``_pytest.assertion.oldinterpret`` module.
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR (:issue:`1226`).

* Comparisons now always show up in full when ``CI`` or ``BUILD_NUMBER`` is
  found in the environment, even when -vv isn't used.
  Thanks :user:`The-Compiler` for the PR.

* ``--lf`` and ``--ff`` now support long names: ``--last-failed`` and
  ``--failed-first`` respectively.
  Thanks :user:`MichaelAquilina` for the PR.

* Added expected exceptions to pytest.raises fail message

* Collection only displays progress ("collecting X items") when in a terminal.
  This avoids cluttering the output when using ``--color=yes`` to obtain
  colors in CI integrations systems (:issue:`1397`).

**Bug Fixes**

* The ``-s`` and ``-c`` options should now work under ``xdist``;
  ``Config.fromdictargs`` now represents its input much more faithfully.
  Thanks to :user:`bukzor` for the complete PR (:issue:`680`).

* Fix (:issue:`1290`): support Python 3.5's ``@`` operator in assertion rewriting.
  Thanks :user:`Shinkenjoe` for report with test case and :user:`tomviner` for the PR.

* Fix formatting utf-8 explanation messages (:issue:`1379`).
  Thanks :user:`biern` for the PR.

* Fix `traceback style docs`_ to describe all of the available options
  (auto/long/short/line/native/no), with ``auto`` being the default since v2.6.
  Thanks :user:`hackebrot` for the PR.

* Fix (:issue:`1422`): junit record_xml_property doesn't allow multiple records
  with same name.

  ``pytest.fail`` with non-ascii characters raises an internal pytest error.
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

python testing sprint June 20th-26th 2016
======================================================

.. image:: ../img/freiburg2.jpg
   :width: 400

The pytest core group held the biggest sprint
in its history in June 2016, taking place in the black forest town Freiburg
in Germany.  In February 2016 we started a `funding
campaign on Indiegogo to cover expenses
<http://igg.me/at/pytest-sprint/x/4034848>`_ The page also mentions
some preliminary topics:

- improving pytest-xdist test scheduling to take into account
  fixture setups and explicit user hints.

- provide info on fixture dependencies during --collect-only

- tying pytest-xdist to tox so that you can do "py.test -e py34"
  to run tests in a particular tox-managed virtualenv.  Also
  look into making pytest-xdist use tox environments on
  remote ssh-sides so that remote dependency management becomes
  easier.

- refactoring the fixture system so more people understand it :)

- integrating PyUnit setup methods as autouse fixtures.
  possibly adding ways to influence ordering of same-scoped
  fixtures (so you can make a choice of which fixtures come
  before others)

- fixing bugs and issues from the tracker, really an endless source :)


Participants
--------------

Over 20 participants took part from 4 continents, including employees
from Splunk, Personalkollen, Cobe.io, FanDuel and Dolby. Some newcomers
mixed with developers who have worked on pytest since its beginning, and
of course everyone in between.


Sprint organisation, schedule
-------------------------------

People arrived in Freiburg on the 19th, with sprint development taking
place on 20th, 21st, 22nd, 24th and 25th. On the 23rd we took a break
day for some hot hiking in the Black Forest.

Sprint activity was organised heavily around pairing, with plenty of group
discussions to take advantage of the high bandwidth, and lightning talks
as well.


Money / funding
---------------


The Indiegogo campaign aimed for 11000 USD and in the end raised over
12000, to reimburse travel costs, pay for a sprint venue and catering.

Excess money is reserved for further sprint/travel funding for pytest/tox
contributors.

.. _`accept example`:

example: specifying and selecting acceptance tests
--------------------------------------------------------------

.. sourcecode:: python

    # ./conftest.py
    def pytest_option(parser):
        group = parser.getgroup("myproject")
        group.addoption(
            "-A", dest="acceptance", action="store_true", help="run (slow) acceptance tests"
        )


    def pytest_funcarg__accept(request):
        return AcceptFixture(request)


    class AcceptFixture:
        def __init__(self, request):
            if not request.config.getoption("acceptance"):
                pytest.skip("specify -A to run acceptance tests")
            self.tmpdir = request.config.mktemp(request.function.__name__, numbered=True)

        def run(self, *cmd):
            """called by test code to execute an acceptance test."""
            self.tmpdir.chdir()
            return subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode()


and the actual test function example:

.. sourcecode:: python

    def test_some_acceptance_aspect(accept):
        accept.tmpdir.mkdir("somesub")
        result = accept.run("ls", "-la")
        assert "somesub" in result

If you run this test without specifying a command line option
the test will get skipped with an appropriate message. Otherwise
you can start to add convenience and test support methods
to your AcceptFixture and drive running of tools or
applications and provide ways to do assertions about
the output.

.. _`decorate a funcarg`:

example: decorating a funcarg in a test module
--------------------------------------------------------------

For larger scale setups it's sometimes useful to decorate
a funcarg just for a particular test module.  We can
extend the `accept example`_ by putting this in our test module:

.. sourcecode:: python

    def pytest_funcarg__accept(request):
        # call the next factory (living in our conftest.py)
        arg = request.getfuncargvalue("accept")
        # create a special layout in our tempdir
        arg.tmpdir.mkdir("special")
        return arg


    class TestSpecialAcceptance:
        def test_sometest(self, accept):
            assert accept.tmpdir.join("special").check()

Our module level factory will be invoked first and it can
ask its request object to call the next factory and then
decorate its result.  This mechanism allows us to stay
ignorant of how/where the function argument is provided -
in our example from a `conftest plugin`_.

sidenote: the temporary directory used here are instances of
the `py.path.local`_ class which provides many of the os.path
methods in a convenient way.

.. _`py.path.local`: ../path.html#local
.. _`conftest plugin`: customize.html#conftestplugin
````

## File: doc/en/example/customdirectory.rst

.. _`custom directory collectors`:

Using a custom directory collector
====================================================

By default, pytest collects directories using :class:`pytest.Package`, for directories with ``__init__.py`` files,
and :class:`pytest.Dir` for other directories.
If you want to customize how a directory is collected, you can write your own :class:`pytest.Directory` collector,
and use :hook:`pytest_collect_directory` to hook it up.

.. _`directory manifest plugin`:

A basic example for a directory manifest file
--------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose you want to customize how collection is done on a per-directory basis.
Here is an example ``conftest.py`` plugin that allows directories to contain a ``manifest.json`` file,
which defines how the collection should be done for the directory.
In this example, only a simple list of files is supported,
however you can imagine adding other keys, such as exclusions and globs.

.. include:: customdirectory/conftest.py
    :literal:

You can create a ``manifest.json`` file and some test files:

.. include:: customdirectory/tests/manifest.json
    :literal:

.. include:: customdirectory/tests/test_first.py
    :literal:

.. include:: customdirectory/tests/test_second.py
    :literal:

.. include:: customdirectory/tests/test_third.py
    :literal:

An you can now execute the test specification:

.. code-block:: pytest

    customdirectory $ pytest
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project/customdirectory
    configfile: pytest.ini
    collected 2 items

    tests/test_first.py .                                                [ 50%]
    tests/test_second.py .                                               [100%]

    ============================ 2 passed in 0.12s =============================

.. regendoc:wipe

Notice how ``test_three.py`` was not executed, because it is not listed in the manifest.

You can verify that your custom collector appears in the collection tree:

.. code-block:: pytest

    customdirectory $ pytest --collect-only
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y

Examples and customization tricks
=================================

Here is a (growing) list of examples. :ref:`Contact <contact>` us if you
need more examples or have questions. Also take a look at the
:ref:`comprehensive documentation <toc>` which contains many example
snippets as well.  Also, `pytest on stackoverflow.com
<http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=pytest>`_ often comes with example
answers.

For basic examples, see

- :ref:`get-started` for basic introductory examples
- :ref:`assert` for basic assertion examples
- :ref:`Fixtures <fixtures>` for basic fixture/setup examples
- :ref:`parametrize` for basic test function parametrization
- :ref:`unittest` for basic unittest integration

The following examples aim at various use cases you might encounter.

.. _`mark examples`:

Working with custom markers
=================================================

Here are some examples using the :ref:`mark` mechanism.

.. _`mark run`:

Marking test functions and selecting them for a run
----------------------------------------------------

You can "mark" a test function with custom metadata like this:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_server.py

    import pytest


    @pytest.mark.webtest
    def test_send_http():
        pass  # perform some webtest test for your app


    @pytest.mark.device(serial="123")
    def test_something_quick():
        pass


    @pytest.mark.device(serial="abc")
    def test_another():
        pass


    class TestClass:
        def test_method(self):
            pass



You can then restrict a test run to only run tests marked with ``webtest``:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -v -m webtest
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python
    cachedir: .pytest_cache
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collecting ... collected 4 items / 3 deselected / 1 selected

    test_server.py::test_send_http PASSED                                [100%]

    ===================== 1 passed, 3 deselected in 0.12s ======================

Or the inverse, running all tests except the webtest ones:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -v -m "not webtest"
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python
    cachedir: .pytest_cache
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collecting ... collected 4 items / 1 deselected / 3 selected

    test_server.py::test_something_quick PASSED                          [ 33%]
    test_server.py::test_another PASSED                                  [ 66%]
    test_server.py::TestClass::test_method PASSED                        [100%]

    ===================== 3 passed, 1 deselected in 0.12s ======================

.. _`marker_keyword_expression_example`:

Additionally, you can restrict a test run to only run tests matching one or multiple marker
keyword arguments, e.g. to run only tests marked with ``device`` and the specific ``serial="123"``:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -v -m "device(serial='123')"
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python
    cachedir: .pytest_cache
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collecting ... collected 4 items / 3 deselected / 1 selected

    test_server.py::test_something_quick PASSED                          [100%]

    ===================== 1 passed, 3 deselected in 0.12s ======================

.. note:: Only keyword argument matching is supported in marker expressions.

.. note:: Only :class:`int`, (unescaped) :class:`str`, :class:`bool` & :data:`None` values are supported in marker expressions.

Selecting tests based on their node ID
--------------------------------------

You can provide one or more :ref:`node IDs <node-id>` as positional
arguments to select only specified tests. This makes it easy to select
tests based on their module, class, method, or function name:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -v test_server.py::TestClass::test_method
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python
    cachedir: .pytest_cache
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collecting ... collected 1 item

    test_server.py::TestClass::test_method PASSED                        [100%]

    ============================ 1 passed in 0.12s =============================

You can also select on the class:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -v test_server.py::TestClass
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python
    cachedir: .pytest_cache
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collecting ... collected 1 item

    test_server.py::TestClass::test_method PASSED                        [100%]

    ============================ 1 passed in 0.12s =============================

Or select multiple nodes:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -v test_server.py::TestClass test_server.py::test_send_http
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python
    cachedir: .pytest_cache
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collecting ... collected 2 items

    test_server.py::TestClass::test_method PASSED                        [ 50%]
    test_server.py::test_send_http PASSED                                [100%]

    ============================ 2 passed in 0.12s =============================

.. _node-id:

.. note::

    Node IDs are of the form ``module.py::class::method`` or
    ``module.py::function``.  Node IDs control which tests are
    collected, so ``module.py::class`` will select all test methods
    on the class.  Nodes are also created for each parameter of a
    parametrized fixture or test, so selecting a parametrized test
    must include the parameter value, e.g.
    ``module.py::function[param]``.

    Node IDs for failing tests are displayed in the test summary info
    when running pytest with the ``-rf`` option.  You can also
    construct Node IDs from the output of ``pytest --collect-only``.

Using ``-k expr`` to select tests based on their name
-------------------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.0/2.3.4

You can use the ``-k`` command line option to specify an expression
which implements a substring match on the test names instead of the
exact match on markers that ``-m`` provides.  This makes it easy to
select tests based on their names:

.. versionchanged:: 5.4

The expression matching is now case-insensitive.

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -v -k http  # running with the above defined example module
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python
    cachedir: .pytest_cache
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project

Or to select "http" and "quick" tests:

    ===================== 2 passed, 2 deselected in 0.12s ======================

You can use ``and``, ``or``, ``not`` and parentheses.


In addition to the test's name, ``-k`` also matches the names of the test's parents (usually, the name of the file and class it's in),
attributes set on the test function, markers applied to it or its parents and any :attr:`extra keywords <_pytest.nodes.Node.extra_keyword_matches>`
explicitly added to it or its parents.


Registering markers
-------------------------------------



.. ini-syntax for custom markers:

Registering markers for your test suite is simple:

.. code-block:: ini

    # content of pytest.ini
    [pytest]
    markers =
        webtest: mark a test as a webtest.
        slow: mark test as slow.

Multiple custom markers can be registered, by defining each one in its own line, as shown in above example.

You can ask which markers exist for your test suite - the list includes our just defined ``webtest`` and ``slow`` markers:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest --markers
    @pytest.mark.webtest: mark a test as a webtest.

    @pytest.mark.slow: mark test as slow.

    @pytest.mark.filterwarnings(warning): add a warning filter to the given test. see https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/capture-warnings.html#pytest-mark-filterwarnings

    @pytest.mark.skip(reason=None): skip the given test function with an optional reason. Example: skip(reason="no way of currently testing this") skips the test.

    @pytest.mark.skipif(condition, ..., *, reason=...): skip the given test function if any of the conditions evaluate to True. Example: skipif(sys.platform == 'win32') skips the test if we are on the win32 platform. See https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/reference.html#pytest-mark-skipif

    @pytest.mark.xfail(condition, ..., *, reason=..., run=True, raises=None, strict=xfail_strict): mark the test function as an expected failure if any of the conditions evaluate to True. Optionally specify a reason for better reporting and run=False if you don't even want to execute the test function. If only specific exception(s) are expected, you can list them in raises, and if the test fails in other ways, it will be reported as a true failure. See https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/reference.html#pytest-mark-xfail

    @pytest.mark.parametrize(argnames, argvalues): call a test function multiple times passing in different arguments in turn. argvalues generally needs to be a list of values if argnames specifies only one name or a list of tuples of values if argnames specifies multiple names. Example: @parametrize('arg1', [1,2]) would lead to two calls of the decorated test function, one with arg1=1 and another with arg1=2.see https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/parametrize.html for more info and examples.

    @pytest.mark.usefixtures(fixturename1, fixturename2, ...): mark tests as needing all of the specified fixtures. see https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/explanation/fixtures.html#usefixtures

    @pytest.mark.tryfirst: mark a hook implementation function such that the plugin machinery will try to call it first/as early as possible. DEPRECATED, use @pytest.hookimpl(tryfirst=True) instead.

    @pytest.mark.trylast: mark a hook implementation function such that the plugin machinery will try to call it last/as late as possible. DEPRECATED, use @pytest.hookimpl(trylast=True) instead.


For an example on how to add and work with markers from a plugin, see
:ref:`adding a custom marker from a plugin`.

.. note::

    It is recommended to explicitly register markers so that:

    * There is one place in your test suite defining your markers

    * Asking for existing markers via ``pytest --markers`` gives good output

    * Typos in function markers are treated as an error if you use
      the ``--strict-markers`` option.

.. _`scoped-marking`:

Marking whole classes or modules
----------------------------------------------------

You may use ``pytest.mark`` decorators with classes to apply markers to all of
its test methods:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_mark_classlevel.py
    import pytest


    @pytest.mark.webtest
    class TestClass:
        def test_startup(self):
            pass

        def test_startup_and_more(self):
            pass

This is equivalent to directly applying the decorator to the
two test functions.

To apply marks at the module level, use the :globalvar:`pytestmark` global variable::

    import pytest
    pytestmark = pytest.mark.webtest

or multiple markers::

    pytestmark = [pytest.mark.webtest, pytest.mark.slowtest]


Due to legacy reasons, before class decorators were introduced, it is possible to set the
:globalvar:`pytestmark` attribute on a test class like this:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    class TestClass:
        pytestmark = pytest.mark.webtest

.. _`marking individual tests when using parametrize`:

Marking individual tests when using parametrize
-----------------------------------------------

When using parametrize, applying a mark will make it apply
to each individual test. However it is also possible to
apply a marker to an individual test instance:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    @pytest.mark.foo
    @pytest.mark.parametrize(
        ("n", "expected"), [(1, 2), pytest.param(1, 3, marks=pytest.mark.bar), (2, 3)]
    )
    def test_increment(n, expected):
        assert n + 1 == expected

In this example the mark "foo" will apply to each of the three
tests, whereas the "bar" mark is only applied to the second test.
Skip and xfail marks can also be applied in this way, see :ref:`skip/xfail with parametrize`.

.. _`adding a custom marker from a plugin`:

Custom marker and command line option to control test runs
----------------------------------------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

Plugins can provide custom markers and implement specific behaviour
based on it. This is a self-contained example which adds a command
line option and a parametrized test function marker to run tests
specified via named environments:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py

    import pytest


    def pytest_addoption(parser):
        parser.addoption(
            "-E",
            action="store",
            metavar="NAME",
            help="only run tests matching the environment NAME.",
        )


    def pytest_configure(config):
        # register an additional marker
        config.addinivalue_line(
            "markers", "env(name): mark test to run only on named environment"
        )


    def pytest_runtest_setup(item):
        envnames = [mark.args[0] for mark in item.iter_markers(name="env")]
        if envnames:
            if item.config.getoption("-E") not in envnames:
                pytest.skip(f"test requires env in {envnames!r}")

A test file using this local plugin:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_someenv.py

    import pytest


    @pytest.mark.env("stage1")
    def test_basic_db_operation():
        pass

and an example invocations specifying a different environment than what
the test needs:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -E stage2
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 1 item

    test_someenv.py s                                                    [100%]

    ============================ 1 skipped in 0.12s ============================

and here is one that specifies exactly the environment needed:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -E stage1
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 1 item

    test_someenv.py .                                                    [100%]

    ============================ 1 passed in 0.12s =============================

The ``--markers`` option always gives you a list of available markers:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest --markers
    @pytest.mark.env(name): mark test to run only on named environment

    @pytest.mark.filterwarnings(warning): add a warning filter to the given test. see https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/capture-warnings.html#pytest-mark-filterwarnings

    @pytest.mark.skip(reason=None): skip the given test function with an optional reason. Example: skip(reason="no way of currently testing this") skips the test.

    @pytest.mark.skipif(condition, ..., *, reason=...): skip the given test function if any of the conditions evaluate to True. Example: skipif(sys.platform == 'win32') skips the test if we are on the win32 platform. See https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/reference.html#pytest-mark-skipif

    @pytest.mark.xfail(condition, ..., *, reason=..., run=True, raises=None, strict=xfail_strict): mark the test function as an expected failure if any of the conditions evaluate to True. Optionally specify a reason for better reporting and run=False if you don't even want to execute the test function. If only specific exception(s) are expected, you can list them in raises, and if the test fails in other ways, it will be reported as a true failure. See https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/reference.html#pytest-mark-xfail

    @pytest.mark.parametrize(argnames, argvalues): call a test function multiple times passing in different arguments in turn. argvalues generally needs to be a list of values if argnames specifies only one name or a list of tuples of values if argnames specifies multiple names. Example: @parametrize('arg1', [1,2]) would lead to two calls of the decorated test function, one with arg1=1 and another with arg1=2.see https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/parametrize.html for more info and examples.

    @pytest.mark.usefixtures(fixturename1, fixturename2, ...): mark tests as needing all of the specified fixtures. see https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/explanation/fixtures.html#usefixtures

    @pytest.mark.tryfirst: mark a hook implementation function such that the plugin machinery will try to call it first/as early as possible. DEPRECATED, use @pytest.hookimpl(tryfirst=True) instead.

    @pytest.mark.trylast: mark a hook implementation function such that the plugin machinery will try to call it last/as late as possible. DEPRECATED, use @pytest.hookimpl(trylast=True) instead.


.. _`passing callables to custom markers`:

Passing a callable to custom markers
--------------------------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

Below is the config file that will be used in the next examples:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py
    import sys


    def pytest_runtest_setup(item):
        for marker in item.iter_markers(name="my_marker"):
            print(marker)
            sys.stdout.flush()

A custom marker can have its argument set, i.e. ``args`` and ``kwargs`` properties, defined by either invoking it as a callable or using ``pytest.mark.MARKER_NAME.with_args``. These two methods achieve the same effect most of the time.

However, if there is a callable as the single positional argument with no keyword arguments, using the ``pytest.mark.MARKER_NAME(c)`` will not pass ``c`` as a positional argument but decorate ``c`` with the custom marker (see :ref:`MarkDecorator <mark>`). Fortunately, ``pytest.mark.MARKER_NAME.with_args`` comes to the rescue:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_custom_marker.py
    import pytest


    def hello_world(*args, **kwargs):
        return "Hello World"


    @pytest.mark.my_marker.with_args(hello_world)
    def test_with_args():
        pass

The output is as follows:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q -s
    Mark(name='my_marker', args=(<function hello_world at 0xdeadbeef0001>,), kwargs={})
    .
    1 passed in 0.12s

We can see that the custom marker has its argument set extended with the function ``hello_world``. This is the key difference between creating a custom marker as a callable, which invokes ``__call__`` behind the scenes, and using ``with_args``.


Reading markers which were set from multiple places
----------------------------------------------------

.. versionadded: 2.2.2

.. regendoc:wipe

If you are heavily using markers in your test suite you may encounter the case where a marker is applied several times to a test function.  From plugin
code you can read over all such settings.  Example:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_mark_three_times.py
    import pytest

    pytestmark = pytest.mark.glob("module", x=1)


    @pytest.mark.glob("class", x=2)
    class TestClass:
        @pytest.mark.glob("function", x=3)
        def test_something(self):
            pass

Here we have the marker "glob" applied three times to the same
test function.  From a conftest file we can read it like this:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py
    import sys


    def pytest_runtest_setup(item):
        for mark in item.iter_markers(name="glob"):
            print(f"glob args={mark.args} kwargs={mark.kwargs}")
            sys.stdout.flush()

Let's run this without capturing output and see what we get:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q -s
    glob args=('function',) kwargs={'x': 3}
    glob args=('class',) kwargs={'x': 2}
    glob args=('module',) kwargs={'x': 1}
    .
    1 passed in 0.12s

Marking platform specific tests with pytest
--------------------------------------------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

Consider you have a test suite which marks tests for particular platforms,
namely ``pytest.mark.darwin``, ``pytest.mark.win32`` etc. and you
also have tests that run on all platforms and have no specific
marker.  If you now want to have a way to only run the tests
for your particular platform, you could use the following plugin:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py
    #
    import sys

    import pytest

    ALL = set("darwin linux win32".split())


    def pytest_runtest_setup(item):
        supported_platforms = ALL.intersection(mark.name for mark in item.iter_markers())
        plat = sys.platform
        if supported_platforms and plat not in supported_platforms:
            pytest.skip(f"cannot run on platform {plat}")

then tests will be skipped if they were specified for a different platform.
Let's do a little test file to show how this looks like:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_plat.py

    import pytest


    @pytest.mark.darwin
    def test_if_apple_is_evil():
        pass


    @pytest.mark.linux
    def test_if_linux_works():
        pass


    @pytest.mark.win32
    def test_if_win32_crashes():
        pass


    def test_runs_everywhere():
        pass

then you will see two tests skipped and two executed tests as expected:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -rs # this option reports skip reasons
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 4 items

    test_plat.py s.s.                                                    [100%]

    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    SKIPPED [2] conftest.py:13: cannot run on platform linux
    ======================= 2 passed, 2 skipped in 0.12s =======================

Note that if you specify a platform via the marker-command line option like this:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -m linux
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 4 items / 3 deselected / 1 selected

    test_plat.py .                                                       [100%]

    ===================== 1 passed, 3 deselected in 0.12s ======================

then the unmarked-tests will not be run.  It is thus a way to restrict the run to the specific tests.

Automatically adding markers based on test names
--------------------------------------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

If you have a test suite where test function names indicate a certain
type of test, you can implement a hook that automatically defines
markers so that you can use the ``-m`` option with it. Let's look
at this test module:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_module.py


    def test_interface_simple():
        assert 0


    def test_interface_complex():
        assert 0


    def test_event_simple():
        assert 0


    def test_something_else():
        assert 0

We want to dynamically define two markers and can do it in a
``conftest.py`` plugin:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py

    import pytest


    def pytest_collection_modifyitems(items):
        for item in items:
            if "interface" in item.nodeid:
                item.add_marker(pytest.mark.interface)
            elif "event" in item.nodeid:
                item.add_marker(pytest.mark.event)

We can now use the ``-m option`` to select one set:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -m interface --tb=short
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y

    test_module.py FF                                                    [100%]

or to select both "event" and "interface" tests:

    $ pytest -m "interface or event" --tb=short

.. _`non-python tests`:

Working with non-python tests
====================================================

.. _`yaml plugin`:

A basic example for specifying tests in Yaml files
--------------------------------------------------------------

.. _`pytest-yamlwsgi`: https://pypi.org/project/pytest-yamlwsgi/

Here is an example ``conftest.py`` (extracted from Ali Afshar's special purpose `pytest-yamlwsgi`_ plugin).   This ``conftest.py`` will  collect ``test*.yaml`` files and will execute the yaml-formatted content as custom tests:

.. include:: nonpython/conftest.py
    :literal:

You can create a simple example file:

.. include:: nonpython/test_simple.yaml
    :literal:

and if you installed :pypi:`PyYAML` or a compatible YAML-parser you can
now execute the test specification:

.. code-block:: pytest

    nonpython $ pytest test_simple.yaml
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project/nonpython
    collected 2 items

    test_simple.yaml F.                                                  [100%]

    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    ______________________________ usecase: hello ______________________________

       spec failed: 'some': 'other'
       no further details known at this point.
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_simple.yaml::hello
    ======================= 1 failed, 1 passed in 0.12s ========================

.. regendoc:wipe

You get one dot for the passing ``sub1: sub1`` check and one failure.
Obviously in the above ``conftest.py`` you'll want to implement a more
interesting interpretation of the yaml-values.  You can easily write
your own domain specific testing language this way.

.. note::

    ``repr_failure(excinfo)`` is called for representing test failures.
    If you create custom collection nodes you can return an error
    representation string of your choice.  It
    will be reported as a (red) string.

``reportinfo()`` is used for representing the test location and is also
consulted when reporting in ``verbose`` mode:

.. code-block:: pytest

    nonpython $ pytest -v
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python

.. regendoc:wipe

While developing your custom test collection and execution it's also
interesting to just look at the collection tree:

Parametrizing tests
=================================================

``pytest`` allows to easily parametrize test functions.
For basic docs, see :ref:`parametrize-basics`.

In the following we provide some examples using
the builtin mechanisms.

Generating parameters combinations, depending on command line
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

Let's say we want to execute a test with different computation
parameters and the parameter range shall be determined by a command
line argument.  Let's first write a simple (do-nothing) computation test:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_compute.py


    def test_compute(param1):
        assert param1 < 4

Now we add a test configuration like this:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py


    def pytest_addoption(parser):
        parser.addoption("--all", action="store_true", help="run all combinations")


    def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):
        if "param1" in metafunc.fixturenames:
            if metafunc.config.getoption("all"):
                end = 5
            else:
                end = 2
            metafunc.parametrize("param1", range(end))

This means that we only run 2 tests if we do not pass ``--all``:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q test_compute.py
    ..                                                                   [100%]
    2 passed in 0.12s

We run only two computations, so we see two dots.
let's run the full monty:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q --all
    ....F                                                                [100%]
    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    _____________________________ test_compute[4] ______________________________

    param1 = 4

        def test_compute(param1):
    >       assert param1 < 4
    E       assert 4 < 4

    test_compute.py:4: AssertionError
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_compute.py::test_compute[4] - assert 4 < 4
    1 failed, 4 passed in 0.12s

As expected when running the full range of ``param1`` values
we'll get an error on the last one.


Different options for test IDs
------------------------------------

pytest will build a string that is the test ID for each set of values in a
parametrized test. These IDs can be used with ``-k`` to select specific cases
to run, and they will also identify the specific case when one is failing.
Running pytest with ``--collect-only`` will show the generated IDs.

Numbers, strings, booleans and None will have their usual string representation
used in the test ID. For other objects, pytest will make a string based on
the argument name:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_time.py

    from datetime import datetime, timedelta

    import pytest

    testdata = [
        (datetime(2001, 12, 12), datetime(2001, 12, 11), timedelta(1)),
        (datetime(2001, 12, 11), datetime(2001, 12, 12), timedelta(-1)),
    ]


    @pytest.mark.parametrize("a,b,expected", testdata)
    def test_timedistance_v0(a, b, expected):
        diff = a - b
        assert diff == expected


    @pytest.mark.parametrize("a,b,expected", testdata, ids=["forward", "backward"])
    def test_timedistance_v1(a, b, expected):
        diff = a - b
        assert diff == expected


    def idfn(val):
        if isinstance(val, (datetime,)):
            # note this wouldn't show any hours/minutes/seconds
            return val.strftime("%Y%m%d")


    @pytest.mark.parametrize("a,b,expected", testdata, ids=idfn)
    def test_timedistance_v2(a, b, expected):
        diff = a - b
        assert diff == expected


    @pytest.mark.parametrize(
        "a,b,expected",
        [
            pytest.param(
                datetime(2001, 12, 12), datetime(2001, 12, 11), timedelta(1), id="forward"
            ),
            pytest.param(
                datetime(2001, 12, 11), datetime(2001, 12, 12), timedelta(-1), id="backward"
            ),
        ],
    )
    def test_timedistance_v3(a, b, expected):
        diff = a - b
        assert diff == expected

In ``test_timedistance_v0``, we let pytest generate the test IDs.

In ``test_timedistance_v1``, we specified ``ids`` as a list of strings which were
used as the test IDs. These are succinct, but can be a pain to maintain.

In ``test_timedistance_v2``, we specified ``ids`` as a function that can generate a
string representation to make part of the test ID. So our ``datetime`` values use the
label generated by ``idfn``, but because we didn't generate a label for ``timedelta``
objects, they are still using the default pytest representation:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest test_time.py --collect-only
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y

        <Function test_timedistance_v3[backward]>

    ======================== 8 tests collected in 0.12s ========================

In ``test_timedistance_v3``, we used ``pytest.param`` to specify the test IDs
together with the actual data, instead of listing them separately.

A quick port of "testscenarios"
------------------------------------

Here is a quick port to run tests configured with :pypi:`testscenarios`,
an add-on from Robert Collins for the standard unittest framework. We
only have to work a bit to construct the correct arguments for pytest's
:py:func:`Metafunc.parametrize <pytest.Metafunc.parametrize>`:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_scenarios.py


    def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):
        idlist = []
        argvalues = []
        for scenario in metafunc.cls.scenarios:
            idlist.append(scenario[0])
            items = scenario[1].items()
            argnames = [x[0] for x in items]
            argvalues.append([x[1] for x in items])
        metafunc.parametrize(argnames, argvalues, ids=idlist, scope="class")


    scenario1 = ("basic", {"attribute": "value"})
    scenario2 = ("advanced", {"attribute": "value2"})


    class TestSampleWithScenarios:
        scenarios = [scenario1, scenario2]

        def test_demo1(self, attribute):
            assert isinstance(attribute, str)

        def test_demo2(self, attribute):
            assert isinstance(attribute, str)

this is a fully self-contained example which you can run with:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest test_scenarios.py
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 4 items

    test_scenarios.py ....                                               [100%]

    ============================ 4 passed in 0.12s =============================

If you just collect tests you'll also nicely see 'advanced' and 'basic' as variants for the test function:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest --collect-only test_scenarios.py
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 4 items

    <Dir parametrize.rst-208>
      <Module test_scenarios.py>
        <Class TestSampleWithScenarios>
          <Function test_demo1[basic]>
          <Function test_demo2[basic]>
          <Function test_demo1[advanced]>
          <Function test_demo2[advanced]>

    ======================== 4 tests collected in 0.12s ========================

Note that we told ``metafunc.parametrize()`` that your scenario values
should be considered class-scoped.  With pytest-2.3 this leads to a
resource-based ordering.

Deferring the setup of parametrized resources
---------------------------------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

The parametrization of test functions happens at collection
time.  It is a good idea to setup expensive resources like DB
connections or subprocess only when the actual test is run.
Here is a simple example how you can achieve that. This test
requires a ``db`` object fixture:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_backends.py

    import pytest


    def test_db_initialized(db):
        # a dummy test
        if db.__class__.__name__ == "DB2":
            pytest.fail("deliberately failing for demo purposes")

We can now add a test configuration that generates two invocations of
the ``test_db_initialized`` function and also implements a factory that
creates a database object for the actual test invocations:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py
    import pytest


    def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):
        if "db" in metafunc.fixturenames:
            metafunc.parametrize("db", ["d1", "d2"], indirect=True)


    class DB1:
        "one database object"


    class DB2:
        "alternative database object"


    @pytest.fixture
    def db(request):
        if request.param == "d1":
            return DB1()
        elif request.param == "d2":
            return DB2()
        else:
            raise ValueError("invalid internal test config")

Let's first see how it looks like at collection time:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest test_backends.py --collect-only
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 2 items

    <Dir parametrize.rst-208>
      <Module test_backends.py>
        <Function test_db_initialized[d1]>
        <Function test_db_initialized[d2]>

    ======================== 2 tests collected in 0.12s ========================

And then when we run the test:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q test_backends.py
    .F                                                                   [100%]
    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    _________________________ test_db_initialized[d2] __________________________

    db = <conftest.DB2 object at 0xdeadbeef0001>

        def test_db_initialized(db):
            # a dummy test
            if db.__class__.__name__ == "DB2":
    >           pytest.fail("deliberately failing for demo purposes")
    E           Failed: deliberately failing for demo purposes

    test_backends.py:8: Failed
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_backends.py::test_db_initialized[d2] - Failed: deliberately f...
    1 failed, 1 passed in 0.12s

The first invocation with ``db == "DB1"`` passed while the second with ``db == "DB2"`` failed.  Our ``db`` fixture function has instantiated each of the DB values during the setup phase while the ``pytest_generate_tests`` generated two according calls to the ``test_db_initialized`` during the collection phase.

Indirect parametrization
---------------------------------------------------

Using the ``indirect=True`` parameter when parametrizing a test allows one to
parametrize a test with a fixture receiving the values before passing them to a
test:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture
    def fixt(request):
        return request.param * 3


    @pytest.mark.parametrize("fixt", ["a", "b"], indirect=True)
    def test_indirect(fixt):
        assert len(fixt) == 3

This can be used, for example, to do more expensive setup at test run time in
the fixture, rather than having to run those setup steps at collection time.

.. regendoc:wipe

Apply indirect on particular arguments
---------------------------------------------------

Very often parametrization uses more than one argument name. There is opportunity to apply ``indirect``
parameter on particular arguments. It can be done by passing list or tuple of
arguments' names to ``indirect``. In the example below there is a function ``test_indirect`` which uses
two fixtures: ``x`` and ``y``. Here we give to indirect the list, which contains the name of the
fixture ``x``. The indirect parameter will be applied to this argument only, and the value ``a``
will be passed to respective fixture function:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_indirect_list.py

    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture(scope="function")
    def x(request):
        return request.param * 3


    @pytest.fixture(scope="function")
    def y(request):
        return request.param * 2


    @pytest.mark.parametrize("x, y", [("a", "b")], indirect=["x"])
    def test_indirect(x, y):
        assert x == "aaa"
        assert y == "b"

The result of this test will be successful:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -v test_indirect_list.py
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python

    ============================ 1 passed in 0.12s =============================

.. regendoc:wipe

Parametrizing test methods through per-class configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------

.. _`unittest parametrizer`: https://github.com/testing-cabal/unittest-ext/blob/master/params.py


Here is an example ``pytest_generate_tests`` function implementing a
parametrization scheme similar to Michael Foord's `unittest
parametrizer`_ but in a lot less code:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of ./test_parametrize.py
    import pytest


    def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):
        # called once per each test function
        funcarglist = metafunc.cls.params[metafunc.function.__name__]
        argnames = sorted(funcarglist[0])
        metafunc.parametrize(
            argnames, [[funcargs[name] for name in argnames] for funcargs in funcarglist]
        )


    class TestClass:
        # a map specifying multiple argument sets for a test method
        params = {
            "test_equals": [dict(a=1, b=2), dict(a=3, b=3)],
            "test_zerodivision": [dict(a=1, b=0)],
        }

        def test_equals(self, a, b):
            assert a == b

        def test_zerodivision(self, a, b):
            with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):
                a / b

Our test generator looks up a class-level definition which specifies which
argument sets to use for each test function.  Let's run it:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q
    F..                                                                  [100%]
    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    ________________________ TestClass.test_equals[1-2] ________________________

    self = <test_parametrize.TestClass object at 0xdeadbeef0002>, a = 1, b = 2

        def test_equals(self, a, b):
    >       assert a == b
    E       assert 1 == 2

    test_parametrize.py:21: AssertionError
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_parametrize.py::TestClass::test_equals[1-2] - assert 1 == 2
    1 failed, 2 passed in 0.12s

Parametrization with multiple fixtures
--------------------------------------

Here is a stripped down real-life example of using parametrized
testing for testing serialization of objects between different python
interpreters.  We define a ``test_basic_objects`` function which
is to be run with different sets of arguments for its three arguments:

* ``python1``: first python interpreter, run to pickle-dump an object to a file
* ``python2``: second interpreter, run to pickle-load an object from a file
* ``obj``: object to be dumped/loaded

.. literalinclude:: multipython.py

Running it results in some skips if we don't have all the python interpreters installed and otherwise runs all combinations (3 interpreters times 3 interpreters times 3 objects to serialize/deserialize):

.. code-block:: pytest

   . $ pytest -rs -q multipython.py
   sssssssssssssssssssssssssss                                          [100%]
   ========================= short test summary info ==========================
   SKIPPED [9] multipython.py:67: 'python3.9' not found
   SKIPPED [9] multipython.py:67: 'python3.10' not found
   SKIPPED [9] multipython.py:67: 'python3.11' not found
   27 skipped in 0.12s

Parametrization of optional implementations/imports
---------------------------------------------------

If you want to compare the outcomes of several implementations of a given
API, you can write test functions that receive the already imported implementations
and get skipped in case the implementation is not importable/available.  Let's
say we have a "base" implementation and the other (possibly optimized ones)
need to provide similar results:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py

    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
    def basemod(request):
        return pytest.importorskip("base")


    @pytest.fixture(scope="session", params=["opt1", "opt2"])
    def optmod(request):
        return pytest.importorskip(request.param)

And then a base implementation of a simple function:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of base.py
    def func1():
        return 1

And an optimized version:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of opt1.py
    def func1():
        return 1.0001

And finally a little test module:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_module.py


    def test_func1(basemod, optmod):
        assert round(basemod.func1(), 3) == round(optmod.func1(), 3)


If you run this with reporting for skips enabled:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -rs test_module.py
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 2 items

    test_module.py .s                                                    [100%]

    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    SKIPPED [1] test_module.py:3: could not import 'opt2': No module named 'opt2'
    ======================= 1 passed, 1 skipped in 0.12s =======================

You'll see that we don't have an ``opt2`` module and thus the second test run
of our ``test_func1`` was skipped.  A few notes:

- the fixture functions in the ``conftest.py`` file are "session-scoped" because we
  don't need to import more than once

- if you have multiple test functions and a skipped import, you will see
  the ``[1]`` count increasing in the report

- you can put :ref:`@pytest.mark.parametrize <@pytest.mark.parametrize>` style
  parametrization on the test functions to parametrize input/output
  values as well.


Set marks or test ID for individual parametrized test
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Use ``pytest.param`` to apply marks or set test ID to individual parametrized test.
For example:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_pytest_param_example.py
    import pytest


    @pytest.mark.parametrize(
        "test_input,expected",
        [
            ("3+5", 8),
            pytest.param("1+7", 8, marks=pytest.mark.basic),
            pytest.param("2+4", 6, marks=pytest.mark.basic, id="basic_2+4"),
            pytest.param(
                "6*9", 42, marks=[pytest.mark.basic, pytest.mark.xfail], id="basic_6*9"
            ),
        ],
    )
    def test_eval(test_input, expected):
        assert eval(test_input) == expected

In this example, we have 4 parametrized tests. Except for the first test,
we mark the rest three parametrized tests with the custom marker ``basic``,
and for the fourth test we also use the built-in mark ``xfail`` to indicate this
test is expected to fail. For explicitness, we set test ids for some tests.

Then run ``pytest`` with verbose mode and with only the ``basic`` marker:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -v -m basic
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python
    cachedir: .pytest_cache
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collecting ... collected 24 items / 21 deselected / 3 selected

    test_pytest_param_example.py::test_eval[1+7-8] PASSED                [ 33%]
    test_pytest_param_example.py::test_eval[basic_2+4] PASSED            [ 66%]
    test_pytest_param_example.py::test_eval[basic_6*9] XFAIL             [100%]

    =============== 2 passed, 21 deselected, 1 xfailed in 0.12s ================

As the result:

- Four tests were collected
- One test was deselected because it doesn't have the ``basic`` mark.
- Three tests with the ``basic`` mark was selected.
- The test ``test_eval[1+7-8]`` passed, but the name is autogenerated and confusing.
- The test ``test_eval[basic_2+4]`` passed.
- The test ``test_eval[basic_6*9]`` was expected to fail and did fail.

.. _`parametrizing_conditional_raising`:

Parametrizing conditional raising
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Use :func:`pytest.raises` with the
:ref:`pytest.mark.parametrize ref` decorator to write parametrized tests
in which some tests raise exceptions and others do not.

``contextlib.nullcontext`` can be used to test cases that are not expected to
raise exceptions but that should result in some value. The value is given as the
``enter_result`` parameter, which will be available as the ``with`` statement’s
target (``e`` in the example below).

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    from contextlib import nullcontext

    import pytest


    @pytest.mark.parametrize(
        "example_input,expectation",
        [
            (3, nullcontext(2)),
            (2, nullcontext(3)),
            (1, nullcontext(6)),
            (0, pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError)),
        ],
    )
    def test_division(example_input, expectation):
        """Test how much I know division."""
        with expectation as e:
            assert (6 / example_input) == e

In the example above, the first three test cases should run without any
exceptions, while the fourth should raise a ``ZeroDivisionError`` exception,
which is expected by pytest.

Changing standard (Python) test discovery
===============================================

Ignore paths during test collection
-----------------------------------

You can easily ignore certain test directories and modules during collection
by passing the ``--ignore=path`` option on the cli. ``pytest`` allows multiple
``--ignore`` options. Example:

.. code-block:: text

    tests/
    |-- example
    |   |-- test_example_01.py
    |   |-- test_example_02.py
    |   '-- test_example_03.py
    |-- foobar
    |   |-- test_foobar_01.py
    |   |-- test_foobar_02.py
    |   '-- test_foobar_03.py
    '-- hello
        '-- world
            |-- test_world_01.py
            |-- test_world_02.py
            '-- test_world_03.py

Now if you invoke ``pytest`` with ``--ignore=tests/foobar/test_foobar_03.py --ignore=tests/hello/``,
you will see that ``pytest`` only collects test-modules, which do not match the patterns specified:

.. code-block:: pytest

    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-5.x.y, py-1.x.y, pluggy-0.x.y
    rootdir: $REGENDOC_TMPDIR, inifile:
    collected 5 items

    tests/example/test_example_01.py .                                   [ 20%]
    tests/example/test_example_02.py .                                   [ 40%]
    tests/example/test_example_03.py .                                   [ 60%]
    tests/foobar/test_foobar_01.py .                                     [ 80%]
    tests/foobar/test_foobar_02.py .                                     [100%]

    ========================= 5 passed in 0.02 seconds =========================

The ``--ignore-glob`` option allows to ignore test file paths based on Unix shell-style wildcards.
If you want to exclude test-modules that end with ``_01.py``, execute ``pytest`` with ``--ignore-glob='*_01.py'``.

Deselect tests during test collection
-------------------------------------

Tests can individually be deselected during collection by passing the ``--deselect=item`` option.
For example, say ``tests/foobar/test_foobar_01.py`` contains ``test_a`` and ``test_b``.
You can run all of the tests within ``tests/`` *except* for ``tests/foobar/test_foobar_01.py::test_a``
by invoking ``pytest`` with ``--deselect tests/foobar/test_foobar_01.py::test_a``.
``pytest`` allows multiple ``--deselect`` options.

Keeping duplicate paths specified from command line
----------------------------------------------------

Default behavior of ``pytest`` is to ignore duplicate paths specified from the command line.
Example:

.. code-block:: pytest

    pytest path_a path_a

    ...
    collected 1 item
    ...

Just collect tests once.

To collect duplicate tests, use the ``--keep-duplicates`` option on the cli.
Example:

.. code-block:: pytest

    pytest --keep-duplicates path_a path_a

    ...
    collected 2 items
    ...

As the collector just works on directories, if you specify twice a single test file, ``pytest`` will
still collect it twice, no matter if the ``--keep-duplicates`` is not specified.
Example:

.. code-block:: pytest

    pytest test_a.py test_a.py

    ...
    collected 2 items
    ...


Changing directory recursion
-----------------------------------------------------

You can set the :confval:`norecursedirs` option in an ini-file, for example your ``pytest.ini`` in the project root directory:

.. code-block:: ini

    # content of pytest.ini
    [pytest]
    norecursedirs = .svn _build tmp*

This would tell ``pytest`` to not recurse into typical subversion or sphinx-build directories or into any ``tmp`` prefixed directory.

.. _`change naming conventions`:

Changing naming conventions
-----------------------------------------------------

You can configure different naming conventions by setting
the :confval:`python_files`, :confval:`python_classes` and
:confval:`python_functions` in your :ref:`configuration file <config file formats>`.
Here is an example:

.. code-block:: ini

    # content of pytest.ini
    # Example 1: have pytest look for "check" instead of "test"
    [pytest]
    python_files = check_*.py
    python_classes = Check
    python_functions = *_check

This would make ``pytest`` look for tests in files that match the ``check_*
.py`` glob-pattern, ``Check`` prefixes in classes, and functions and methods
that match ``*_check``. For example, if we have:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of check_myapp.py
    class CheckMyApp:
        def simple_check(self):
            pass

        def complex_check(self):
            pass

The test collection would look like this:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest --collect-only
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    configfile: pytest.ini
    collected 2 items

    <Dir pythoncollection.rst-209>
      <Module check_myapp.py>
        <Class CheckMyApp>
          <Function simple_check>
          <Function complex_check>

    ======================== 2 tests collected in 0.12s ========================

You can check for multiple glob patterns by adding a space between the patterns:

.. code-block:: ini

    # Example 2: have pytest look for files with "test" and "example"
    # content of pytest.ini
    [pytest]
    python_files = test_*.py example_*.py

.. note::

   the ``python_functions`` and ``python_classes`` options has no effect
   for ``unittest.TestCase`` test discovery because pytest delegates
   discovery of test case methods to unittest code.

Interpreting cmdline arguments as Python packages
-----------------------------------------------------

You can use the ``--pyargs`` option to make ``pytest`` try
interpreting arguments as python package names, deriving
their file system path and then running the test. For
example if you have unittest2 installed you can type:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --pyargs unittest2.test.test_skipping -q

which would run the respective test module.  Like with
other options, through an ini-file and the :confval:`addopts` option you
can make this change more permanently:

.. code-block:: ini

    # content of pytest.ini
    [pytest]
    addopts = --pyargs

Now a simple invocation of ``pytest NAME`` will check
if NAME exists as an importable package/module and otherwise
treat it as a filesystem path.

Finding out what is collected
-----------------------------------------------

You can always peek at the collection tree without running tests like this:

.. code-block:: pytest

    . $ pytest --collect-only pythoncollection.py
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    configfile: pytest.ini
    collected 3 items

    <Dir pythoncollection.rst-209>
      <Dir CWD>
        <Module pythoncollection.py>
          <Function test_function>
          <Class TestClass>
            <Function test_method>
            <Function test_anothermethod>

    ======================== 3 tests collected in 0.12s ========================

.. _customizing-test-collection:

Customizing test collection
---------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

You can easily instruct ``pytest`` to discover tests from every Python file:

.. code-block:: ini

    # content of pytest.ini
    [pytest]
    python_files = *.py

However, many projects will have a ``setup.py`` which they don't want to be
imported. Moreover, there may files only importable by a specific python
version. For such cases you can dynamically define files to be ignored by
listing them in a ``conftest.py`` file:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py
    import sys

    collect_ignore = ["setup.py"]
    if sys.version_info[0] > 2:
        collect_ignore.append("pkg/module_py2.py")

and then if you have a module file like this:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of pkg/module_py2.py
    def test_only_on_python2():
        try:
            assert 0
        except Exception, e:
            pass

and a ``setup.py`` dummy file like this:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of setup.py
    0 / 0  # will raise exception if imported

If you run with a Python 2 interpreter then you will find the one test and will
leave out the ``setup.py`` file:

.. code-block:: pytest

    #$ pytest --collect-only
    ====== test session starts ======
    platform linux2 -- Python 2.7.10, pytest-2.9.1, py-1.4.31, pluggy-0.3.1
    rootdir: $REGENDOC_TMPDIR, inifile: pytest.ini
    collected 1 items
    <Module 'pkg/module_py2.py'>
      <Function 'test_only_on_python2'>

    ====== 1 tests found in 0.04 seconds ======

If you run with a Python 3 interpreter both the one test and the ``setup.py``
file will be left out:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest --collect-only
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    configfile: pytest.ini
    collected 0 items

    ======================= no tests collected in 0.12s ========================

It's also possible to ignore files based on Unix shell-style wildcards by adding
patterns to :globalvar:`collect_ignore_glob`.

The following example ``conftest.py`` ignores the file ``setup.py`` and in
addition all files that end with ``*_py2.py`` when executed with a Python 3
interpreter:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py
    import sys

    collect_ignore = ["setup.py"]
    if sys.version_info[0] > 2:
        collect_ignore_glob = ["*_py2.py"]

Since Pytest 2.6, users can prevent pytest from discovering classes that start
with ``Test`` by setting a boolean ``__test__`` attribute to ``False``.

.. code-block:: python

    # Will not be discovered as a test
    class TestClass:
        __test__ = False

.. note::

   If you are working with abstract test classes and want to avoid manually setting
   the ``__test__`` attribute for subclasses, you can use a mixin class to handle
   this automatically. For example:

   .. code-block:: python

       # Mixin to handle abstract test classes
       class NotATest:
           def __init_subclass__(cls):
               cls.__test__ = NotATest not in cls.__bases__


       # Abstract test class
       class AbstractTest(NotATest):
           pass


       # Subclass that will be collected as a test
       class RealTest(AbstractTest):
           def test_example(self):
               assert 1 + 1 == 2

   This approach ensures that subclasses of abstract test classes are automatically
   collected without needing to explicitly set the ``__test__`` attribute.

How to change command line options defaults
-------------------------------------------

It can be tedious to type the same series of command line options
every time you use ``pytest``.  For example, if you always want to see
detailed info on skipped and xfailed tests, as well as have terser "dot"
progress output, you can write it into a configuration file:

.. code-block:: ini

    # content of pytest.ini
    [pytest]
    addopts = -ra -q


Alternatively, you can set a ``PYTEST_ADDOPTS`` environment variable to add command
line options while the environment is in use:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PYTEST_ADDOPTS="-v"

Here's how the command-line is built in the presence of ``addopts`` or the environment variable:

.. code-block:: text

    <pytest.ini:addopts> $PYTEST_ADDOPTS <extra command-line arguments>

So if the user executes in the command-line:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -m slow

The actual command line executed is:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -ra -q -v -m slow

Note that as usual for other command-line applications, in case of conflicting options the last one wins, so the example
above will show verbose output because ``-v`` overwrites ``-q``.


.. _request example:

Pass different values to a test function, depending on command line options
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

Suppose we want to write a test that depends on a command line option.
Here is a basic pattern to achieve this:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_sample.py
    def test_answer(cmdopt):
        if cmdopt == "type1":
            print("first")
        elif cmdopt == "type2":
            print("second")
        assert 0  # to see what was printed


For this to work we need to add a command line option and
provide the ``cmdopt`` through a :ref:`fixture function <fixture>`:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py
    import pytest


    def pytest_addoption(parser):
        parser.addoption(
            "--cmdopt", action="store", default="type1", help="my option: type1 or type2"
        )


    @pytest.fixture
    def cmdopt(request):
        return request.config.getoption("--cmdopt")

Let's run this without supplying our new option:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q test_sample.py
    F                                                                    [100%]
    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    _______________________________ test_answer ________________________________

    cmdopt = 'type1'

        def test_answer(cmdopt):
            if cmdopt == "type1":
                print("first")
            elif cmdopt == "type2":
                print("second")
    >       assert 0  # to see what was printed
            ^^^^^^^^
    E       assert 0

    test_sample.py:6: AssertionError
    --------------------------- Captured stdout call ---------------------------
    first
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_sample.py::test_answer - assert 0
    1 failed in 0.12s

And now with supplying a command line option:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q --cmdopt=type2
    F                                                                    [100%]
    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    _______________________________ test_answer ________________________________

    cmdopt = 'type2'

        def test_answer(cmdopt):
            if cmdopt == "type1":
                print("first")
            elif cmdopt == "type2":
                print("second")
    >       assert 0  # to see what was printed
            ^^^^^^^^
    E       assert 0

    test_sample.py:6: AssertionError
    --------------------------- Captured stdout call ---------------------------
    second
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_sample.py::test_answer - assert 0
    1 failed in 0.12s

You can see that the command line option arrived in our test.

We could add simple validation for the input by listing the choices:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py
    import pytest


    def pytest_addoption(parser):
        parser.addoption(
            "--cmdopt",
            action="store",
            default="type1",
            help="my option: type1 or type2",
            choices=("type1", "type2"),
        )

Now we'll get feedback on a bad argument:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q --cmdopt=type3
    ERROR: usage: pytest [options] [file_or_dir] [file_or_dir] [...]
    pytest: error: argument --cmdopt: invalid choice: 'type3' (choose from type1, type2)


If you need to provide more detailed error messages, you can use the
``type`` parameter and raise :exc:`pytest.UsageError`:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py
    import pytest


    def type_checker(value):
        msg = "cmdopt must specify a numeric type as typeNNN"
        if not value.startswith("type"):
            raise pytest.UsageError(msg)
        try:
            int(value[4:])
        except ValueError:
            raise pytest.UsageError(msg)

        return value


    def pytest_addoption(parser):
        parser.addoption(
            "--cmdopt",
            action="store",
            default="type1",
            help="my option: type1 or type2",
            type=type_checker,
        )

This completes the basic pattern.  However, one often rather wants to
process command line options outside of the test and rather pass in
different or more complex objects.

Dynamically adding command line options
--------------------------------------------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

Through :confval:`addopts` you can statically add command line
options for your project.  You can also dynamically modify
the command line arguments before they get processed:

.. code-block:: python

    # installable external plugin
    import sys


    def pytest_load_initial_conftests(args):
        if "xdist" in sys.modules:  # pytest-xdist plugin
            import multiprocessing

            num = max(multiprocessing.cpu_count() / 2, 1)
            args[:] = ["-n", str(num)] + args

If you have the :pypi:`xdist plugin <pytest-xdist>` installed
you will now always perform test runs using a number
of subprocesses close to your CPU. Running in an empty
directory with the above conftest.py:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 0 items

    ========================== no tests ran in 0.12s ===========================

.. _`excontrolskip`:

Control skipping of tests according to command line option
--------------------------------------------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

Here is a ``conftest.py`` file adding a ``--runslow`` command
line option to control skipping of ``pytest.mark.slow`` marked tests:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py

    import pytest


    def pytest_addoption(parser):
        parser.addoption(
            "--runslow", action="store_true", default=False, help="run slow tests"
        )


    def pytest_configure(config):
        config.addinivalue_line("markers", "slow: mark test as slow to run")


    def pytest_collection_modifyitems(config, items):
        if config.getoption("--runslow"):
            # --runslow given in cli: do not skip slow tests
            return
        skip_slow = pytest.mark.skip(reason="need --runslow option to run")
        for item in items:
            if "slow" in item.keywords:
                item.add_marker(skip_slow)

We can now write a test module like this:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_module.py
    import pytest


    def test_func_fast():
        pass


    @pytest.mark.slow
    def test_func_slow():
        pass

and when running it will see a skipped "slow" test:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -rs    # "-rs" means report details on the little 's'
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 2 items

    test_module.py .s                                                    [100%]

    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    SKIPPED [1] test_module.py:8: need --runslow option to run
    ======================= 1 passed, 1 skipped in 0.12s =======================

Or run it including the ``slow`` marked test:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest --runslow
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 2 items

    test_module.py ..                                                    [100%]

    ============================ 2 passed in 0.12s =============================

.. _`__tracebackhide__`:

Writing well integrated assertion helpers
-----------------------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

If you have a test helper function called from a test you can
use the ``pytest.fail`` marker to fail a test with a certain message.
The test support function will not show up in the traceback if you
set the ``__tracebackhide__`` option somewhere in the helper function.
Example:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_checkconfig.py
    import pytest


    def checkconfig(x):
        __tracebackhide__ = True
        if not hasattr(x, "config"):
            pytest.fail(f"not configured: {x}")


    def test_something():
        checkconfig(42)

The ``__tracebackhide__`` setting influences ``pytest`` showing
of tracebacks: the ``checkconfig`` function will not be shown
unless the ``--full-trace`` command line option is specified.
Let's run our little function:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q test_checkconfig.py
    F                                                                    [100%]
    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    ______________________________ test_something ______________________________

        def test_something():
    >       checkconfig(42)
    E       Failed: not configured: 42

    test_checkconfig.py:11: Failed
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_checkconfig.py::test_something - Failed: not configured: 42
    1 failed in 0.12s

If you only want to hide certain exceptions, you can set ``__tracebackhide__``
to a callable which gets the ``ExceptionInfo`` object. You can for example use
this to make sure unexpected exception types aren't hidden:

.. code-block:: python

    import operator

    import pytest


    class ConfigException(Exception):
        pass


    def checkconfig(x):
        __tracebackhide__ = operator.methodcaller("errisinstance", ConfigException)
        if not hasattr(x, "config"):
            raise ConfigException(f"not configured: {x}")


    def test_something():
        checkconfig(42)

This will avoid hiding the exception traceback on unrelated exceptions (i.e.
bugs in assertion helpers).


Detect if running from within a pytest run
--------------------------------------------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

Usually it is a bad idea to make application code
behave differently if called from a test.  But if you
absolutely must find out if your application code is
running from a test you can do this:

.. code-block:: python

    import os


    if os.environ.get("PYTEST_VERSION") is not None:
        # Things you want to to do if your code is called by pytest.
        ...
    else:
        # Things you want to to do if your code is not called by pytest.
        ...


Adding info to test report header
--------------------------------------------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

It's easy to present extra information in a ``pytest`` run:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py


    def pytest_report_header(config):
        return "project deps: mylib-1.1"

which will add the string to the test header accordingly:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    project deps: mylib-1.1
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 0 items

    ========================== no tests ran in 0.12s ===========================

.. regendoc:wipe

It is also possible to return a list of strings which will be considered as several
lines of information. You may consider ``config.getoption('verbose')`` in order to
display more information if applicable:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py


    def pytest_report_header(config):
        if config.get_verbosity() > 0:
            return ["info1: did you know that ...", "did you?"]

which will add info only when run with "--v":

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -v
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python
    cachedir: .pytest_cache
    info1: did you know that ...
    did you?
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collecting ... collected 0 items

    ========================== no tests ran in 0.12s ===========================

and nothing when run plainly:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 0 items

    ========================== no tests ran in 0.12s ===========================

Profiling test duration
--------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

.. versionadded: 2.2

If you have a slow running large test suite you might want to find
out which tests are the slowest. Let's make an artificial test suite:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_some_are_slow.py
    import time


    def test_funcfast():
        time.sleep(0.1)


    def test_funcslow1():
        time.sleep(0.2)


    def test_funcslow2():
        time.sleep(0.3)

Now we can profile which test functions execute the slowest:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest --durations=3
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 3 items

    test_some_are_slow.py ...                                            [100%]

    =========================== slowest 3 durations ============================
    0.30s call     test_some_are_slow.py::test_funcslow2
    0.20s call     test_some_are_slow.py::test_funcslow1
    0.10s call     test_some_are_slow.py::test_funcfast
    ============================ 3 passed in 0.12s =============================

Incremental testing - test steps
---------------------------------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

Sometimes you may have a testing situation which consists of a series
of test steps.  If one step fails it makes no sense to execute further
steps as they are all expected to fail anyway and their tracebacks
add no insight.  Here is a simple ``conftest.py`` file which introduces
an ``incremental`` marker which is to be used on classes:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py

    from typing import Dict, Tuple

    import pytest

    # store history of failures per test class name and per index in parametrize (if parametrize used)
    _test_failed_incremental: Dict[str, Dict[Tuple[int, ...], str]] = {}


    def pytest_runtest_makereport(item, call):
        if "incremental" in item.keywords:
            # incremental marker is used
            if call.excinfo is not None:
                # the test has failed
                # retrieve the class name of the test
                cls_name = str(item.cls)
                # retrieve the index of the test (if parametrize is used in combination with incremental)
                parametrize_index = (
                    tuple(item.callspec.indices.values())
                    if hasattr(item, "callspec")
                    else ()
                )
                # retrieve the name of the test function
                test_name = item.originalname or item.name
                # store in _test_failed_incremental the original name of the failed test
                _test_failed_incremental.setdefault(cls_name, {}).setdefault(
                    parametrize_index, test_name
                )


    def pytest_runtest_setup(item):
        if "incremental" in item.keywords:
            # retrieve the class name of the test
            cls_name = str(item.cls)
            # check if a previous test has failed for this class
            if cls_name in _test_failed_incremental:
                # retrieve the index of the test (if parametrize is used in combination with incremental)
                parametrize_index = (
                    tuple(item.callspec.indices.values())
                    if hasattr(item, "callspec")
                    else ()
                )
                # retrieve the name of the first test function to fail for this class name and index
                test_name = _test_failed_incremental[cls_name].get(parametrize_index, None)
                # if name found, test has failed for the combination of class name & test name
                if test_name is not None:
                    pytest.xfail(f"previous test failed ({test_name})")


These two hook implementations work together to abort incremental-marked
tests in a class.  Here is a test module example:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_step.py

    import pytest


    @pytest.mark.incremental
    class TestUserHandling:
        def test_login(self):
            pass

        def test_modification(self):
            assert 0

        def test_deletion(self):
            pass


    def test_normal():
        pass

If we run this:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -rx
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 4 items

    test_step.py .Fx.                                                    [100%]

    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    ____________________ TestUserHandling.test_modification ____________________

    self = <test_step.TestUserHandling object at 0xdeadbeef0001>

        def test_modification(self):
    >       assert 0
    E       assert 0

    test_step.py:11: AssertionError
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    XFAIL test_step.py::TestUserHandling::test_deletion - previous test failed (test_modification)
    ================== 1 failed, 2 passed, 1 xfailed in 0.12s ==================

We'll see that ``test_deletion`` was not executed because ``test_modification``
failed.  It is reported as an "expected failure".


Package/Directory-level fixtures (setups)
-------------------------------------------------------

If you have nested test directories, you can have per-directory fixture scopes
by placing fixture functions in a ``conftest.py`` file in that directory.
You can use all types of fixtures including :ref:`autouse fixtures
<autouse fixtures>` which are the equivalent of xUnit's setup/teardown
concept.  It's however recommended to have explicit fixture references in your
tests or test classes rather than relying on implicitly executing
setup/teardown functions, especially if they are far away from the actual tests.

Here is an example for making a ``db`` fixture available in a directory:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of a/conftest.py
    import pytest


    class DB:
        pass


    @pytest.fixture(scope="package")
    def db():
        return DB()

and then a test module in that directory:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of a/test_db.py
    def test_a1(db):
        assert 0, db  # to show value

another test module:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of a/test_db2.py
    def test_a2(db):
        assert 0, db  # to show value

and then a module in a sister directory which will not see
the ``db`` fixture:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of b/test_error.py
    def test_root(db):  # no db here, will error out
        pass

We can run this:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project

The two test modules in the ``a`` directory see the same ``db`` fixture instance
while the one test in the sister-directory ``b`` doesn't see it.  We could of course
also define a ``db`` fixture in that sister directory's ``conftest.py`` file.
Note that each fixture is only instantiated if there is a test actually needing
it (unless you use "autouse" fixture which are always executed ahead of the first test
executing).


Post-process test reports / failures
---------------------------------------

If you want to postprocess test reports and need access to the executing
environment you can implement a hook that gets called when the test
"report" object is about to be created.  Here we write out all failing
test calls and also access a fixture (if it was used by the test) in
case you want to query/look at it during your post processing.  In our
case we just write some information out to a ``failures`` file:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py

    import os.path

    import pytest


    @pytest.hookimpl(wrapper=True, tryfirst=True)
    def pytest_runtest_makereport(item, call):
        # execute all other hooks to obtain the report object
        rep = yield

        # we only look at actual failing test calls, not setup/teardown
        if rep.when == "call" and rep.failed:
            mode = "a" if os.path.exists("failures") else "w"
            with open("failures", mode, encoding="utf-8") as f:
                # let's also access a fixture for the fun of it
                if "tmp_path" in item.fixturenames:
                    extra = " ({})".format(item.funcargs["tmp_path"])
                else:
                    extra = ""

                f.write(rep.nodeid + extra + "\n")

        return rep


if you then have failing tests:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_module.py
    def test_fail1(tmp_path):
        assert 0


    def test_fail2():
        assert 0

and run them:

.. code-block:: pytest

Making test result information available in fixtures
-----------------------------------------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

If you want to make test result reports available in fixture finalizers
here is a little example implemented via a local plugin:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py
    from typing import Dict
    import pytest
    from pytest import StashKey, CollectReport

    phase_report_key = StashKey[Dict[str, CollectReport]]()


    @pytest.hookimpl(wrapper=True, tryfirst=True)
    def pytest_runtest_makereport(item, call):
        # execute all other hooks to obtain the report object
        rep = yield

        # store test results for each phase of a call, which can
        # be "setup", "call", "teardown"
        item.stash.setdefault(phase_report_key, {})[rep.when] = rep

        return rep


    @pytest.fixture
    def something(request):
        yield
        # request.node is an "item" because we use the default
        # "function" scope
        report = request.node.stash[phase_report_key]
        if report["setup"].failed:
            print("setting up a test failed", request.node.nodeid)
        elif report["setup"].skipped:
            print("setting up a test skipped", request.node.nodeid)
        elif ("call" not in report) or report["call"].failed:
            print("executing test failed or skipped", request.node.nodeid)


if you then have failing tests:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_module.py

    @pytest.fixture
    def other():
        assert 0


    def test_setup_fails(something, other):

You'll see that the fixture finalizers could use the precise reporting
information.

.. _pytest current test env:

``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` environment variable
--------------------------------------------



Sometimes a test session might get stuck and there might be no easy way to figure out
which test got stuck, for example if pytest was run in quiet mode (``-q``) or you don't have access to the console
output. This is particularly a problem if the problem happens only sporadically, the famous "flaky" kind of tests.

``pytest`` sets the :envvar:`PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST` environment variable when running tests, which can be inspected
by process monitoring utilities or libraries like :pypi:`psutil` to discover which test got stuck if necessary:

.. code-block:: python

    import psutil

    for pid in psutil.pids():
        environ = psutil.Process(pid).environ()
        if "PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST" in environ:
            print(f'pytest process {pid} running: {environ["PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST"]}')

During the test session pytest will set ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` to the current test
:ref:`nodeid <nodeids>` and the current stage, which can be ``setup``, ``call``,
or ``teardown``.

For example, when running a single test function named ``test_foo`` from ``foo_module.py``,
``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` will be set to:

#. ``foo_module.py::test_foo (setup)``
#. ``foo_module.py::test_foo (call)``
#. ``foo_module.py::test_foo (teardown)``

In that order.

.. note::

    The contents of ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` is meant to be human readable and the actual format
    can be changed between releases (even bug fixes) so it shouldn't be relied on for scripting
    or automation.

.. _freezing-pytest:

Freezing pytest
---------------

If you freeze your application using a tool like
`PyInstaller <https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io>`_
in order to distribute it to your end-users, it is a good idea to also package
your test runner and run your tests using the frozen application. This way packaging
errors such as dependencies not being included into the executable can be detected early
while also allowing you to send test files to users so they can run them in their
machines, which can be useful to obtain more information about a hard to reproduce bug.

Fortunately recent ``PyInstaller`` releases already have a custom hook
for pytest, but if you are using another tool to freeze executables
such as ``cx_freeze`` or ``py2exe``, you can use ``pytest.freeze_includes()``
to obtain the full list of internal pytest modules. How to configure the tools
to find the internal modules varies from tool to tool, however.

Instead of freezing the pytest runner as a separate executable, you can make
your frozen program work as the pytest runner by some clever
argument handling during program startup. This allows you to
have a single executable, which is usually more convenient.
Please note that the mechanism for plugin discovery used by pytest (:ref:`entry
points <pip-installable plugins>`) doesn't work with frozen executables so pytest
can't find any third party plugins automatically. To include third party plugins
like ``pytest-timeout`` they must be imported explicitly and passed on to pytest.main.

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of app_main.py
    import sys

    import pytest_timeout  # Third party plugin

    if len(sys.argv) > 1 and sys.argv[1] == "--pytest":
        import pytest

        sys.exit(pytest.main(sys.argv[2:], plugins=[pytest_timeout]))
    else:
        # normal application execution: at this point argv can be parsed
        # by your argument-parsing library of choice as usual
        ...


This allows you to execute tests using the frozen
application with standard ``pytest`` command-line options:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./app_main --pytest --verbose --tb=long --junit=xml=results.xml test-suite/
````

A session-fixture which can look at all collected tests
----------------------------------------------------------------

A session-scoped fixture effectively has access to all
collected test items.  Here is an example of a fixture
function which walks all collected tests and looks
if their test class defines a ``callme`` method and
calls it:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py

    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
    def callattr_ahead_of_alltests(request):
        print("callattr_ahead_of_alltests called")
        seen = {None}
        session = request.node
        for item in session.items:
            cls = item.getparent(pytest.Class)
            if cls not in seen:
                if hasattr(cls.obj, "callme"):
                    cls.obj.callme()
                seen.add(cls)

test classes may now define a ``callme`` method which
will be called ahead of running any tests:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_module.py


    class TestHello:
        @classmethod
        def callme(cls):
            print("callme called!")

        def test_method1(self):
            print("test_method1 called")

        def test_method2(self):
            print("test_method2 called")


    class TestOther:
        @classmethod
        def callme(cls):
            print("callme other called")

        def test_other(self):
            print("test other")


    # works with unittest as well ...
    import unittest


    class SomeTest(unittest.TestCase):
        @classmethod
        def callme(self):
            print("SomeTest callme called")

        def test_unit1(self):
            print("test_unit1 method called")

If you run this without output capturing:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q -s test_module.py
    callattr_ahead_of_alltests called
    callme called!
    callme other called
    SomeTest callme called
    test_method1 called
    .test_method2 called
    .test other
    .test_unit1 method called
    .

.. _test-anatomy:

Anatomy of a test
=================

In the simplest terms, a test is meant to look at the result of a particular
behavior, and make sure that result aligns with what you would expect.
Behavior is not something that can be empirically measured, which is why writing
tests can be challenging.

"Behavior" is the way in which some system **acts in response** to a particular
situation and/or stimuli. But exactly *how* or *why* something is done is not
quite as important as *what* was done.

You can think of a test as being broken down into four steps:

1. **Arrange**
2. **Act**
3. **Assert**
4. **Cleanup**

**Arrange** is where we prepare everything for our test. This means pretty
much everything except for the "**act**". It's lining up the dominoes so that
the **act** can do its thing in one, state-changing step. This can mean
preparing objects, starting/killing services, entering records into a database,
or even things like defining a URL to query, generating some credentials for a
user that doesn't exist yet, or just waiting for some process to finish.

**Act** is the singular, state-changing action that kicks off the **behavior**
we want to test. This behavior is what carries out the changing of the state of
the system under test (SUT), and it's the resulting changed state that we can
look at to make a judgement about the behavior. This typically takes the form of
a function/method call.

**Assert** is where we look at that resulting state and check if it looks how
we'd expect after the dust has settled. It's where we gather evidence to say the
behavior does or does not align with what we expect. The ``assert`` in our test
is where we take that measurement/observation and apply our judgement to it. If
something should be green, we'd say ``assert thing == "green"``.

**Cleanup** is where the test picks up after itself, so other tests aren't being
accidentally influenced by it.

At its core, the test is ultimately the **act** and **assert** steps, with the
**arrange** step only providing the context. **Behavior** exists between **act**
and **assert**.

.. _`ci-pipelines`:

CI Pipelines
============

Rationale
---------

The goal of testing in a CI pipeline is different from testing locally. Indeed,
you can quickly edit some code and run your tests again on your computer, but
it is not possible with CI pipeline. They run on a separate server and are
triggered by specific actions.

From that observation, pytest can detect when it is in a CI environment and
adapt some of its behaviours.

How CI is detected
------------------

Pytest knows it is in a CI environment when either one of these environment variables are set,
regardless of their value:

* `CI`: used by many CI systems.
* `BUILD_NUMBER`: used by Jenkins.

Effects on CI
-------------

For now, the effects on pytest of being in a CI environment are limited.

When a CI environment is detected, the output of the short test summary info is no longer truncated to the terminal size i.e. the entire message will be shown.

  .. code-block:: python

        # content of test_ci.py
        import pytest


        def test_db_initialized():
            pytest.fail(
                "deliberately failing for demo purpose, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, "
                "consectetur adipiscing elit. Cras facilisis, massa in suscipit "
                "dignissim, mauris lacus molestie nisi, quis varius metus nulla ut ipsum."
            )


Running this locally, without any extra options, will output:

  .. code-block:: pytest

     $ pytest test_ci.py
     ...
     ========================= short test summary info ==========================
     FAILED test_backends.py::test_db_initialized[d2] - Failed: deliberately f...

*(Note the truncated text)*


While running this on CI will output:

  .. code-block:: pytest

     $ export CI=true
     $ pytest test_ci.py
     ...
     ========================= short test summary info ==========================
     FAILED test_backends.py::test_db_initialized[d2] - Failed: deliberately failing

.. _about-fixtures:

About fixtures
===============

.. seealso:: :ref:`how-to-fixtures`
.. seealso:: :ref:`Fixtures reference <reference-fixtures>`

pytest fixtures are designed to be explicit, modular and scalable.

What fixtures are
-----------------

In testing, a `fixture <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_fixture#Software>`_
provides a defined, reliable and consistent context for the tests. This could
include environment (for example a database configured with known parameters)
or content (such as a dataset).

Fixtures define the steps and data that constitute the *arrange* phase of a
test (see :ref:`test-anatomy`). In pytest, they are functions you define that
serve this purpose. They can also be used to define a test's *act* phase; this
is a powerful technique for designing more complex tests.

The services, state, or other operating environments set up by fixtures are
accessed by test functions through arguments. For each fixture used by a test
function there is typically a parameter (named after the fixture) in the test
function's definition.

We can tell pytest that a particular function is a fixture by decorating it with
:py:func:`@pytest.fixture <pytest.fixture>`. Here's a simple example of
what a fixture in pytest might look like:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    class Fruit:
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name

        def __eq__(self, other):
            return self.name == other.name


    @pytest.fixture
    def my_fruit():
        return Fruit("apple")


    @pytest.fixture
    def fruit_basket(my_fruit):
        return [Fruit("banana"), my_fruit]


    def test_my_fruit_in_basket(my_fruit, fruit_basket):
        assert my_fruit in fruit_basket

Tests don't have to be limited to a single fixture, either. They can depend on
as many fixtures as you want, and fixtures can use other fixtures, as well. This
is where pytest's fixture system really shines.


Improvements over xUnit-style setup/teardown functions
-----------------------------------------------------------

pytest fixtures offer dramatic improvements over the classic xUnit
style of setup/teardown functions:

* fixtures have explicit names and are activated by declaring their use
  from test functions, modules, classes or whole projects.

* fixtures are implemented in a modular manner, as each fixture name
  triggers a *fixture function* which can itself use other fixtures.

* fixture management scales from simple unit to complex
  functional testing, allowing to parametrize fixtures and tests according
  to configuration and component options, or to reuse fixtures
  across function, class, module or whole test session scopes.

* teardown logic can be easily, and safely managed, no matter how many fixtures
  are used, without the need to carefully handle errors by hand or micromanage
  the order that cleanup steps are added.

In addition, pytest continues to support :ref:`xunitsetup`.  You can mix
both styles, moving incrementally from classic to new style, as you
prefer.  You can also start out from existing :ref:`unittest.TestCase
style <unittest.TestCase>`.



Fixture errors
--------------

pytest does its best to put all the fixtures for a given test in a linear order
so that it can see which fixture happens first, second, third, and so on. If an
earlier fixture has a problem, though, and raises an exception, pytest will stop
executing fixtures for that test and mark the test as having an error.

When a test is marked as having an error, it doesn't mean the test failed,
though. It just means the test couldn't even be attempted because one of the
things it depends on had a problem.

This is one reason why it's a good idea to cut out as many unnecessary
dependencies as possible for a given test. That way a problem in something
unrelated isn't causing us to have an incomplete picture of what may or may not
have issues.

Here's a quick example to help explain:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture
    def order():
        return []


    @pytest.fixture
    def append_first(order):
        order.append(1)


    @pytest.fixture
    def append_second(order, append_first):
        order.extend([2])


    @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
    def append_third(order, append_second):
        order += [3]


    def test_order(order):
        assert order == [1, 2, 3]


If, for whatever reason, ``order.append(1)`` had a bug and it raises an exception,
we wouldn't be able to know if ``order.extend([2])`` or ``order += [3]`` would
also have problems. After ``append_first`` throws an exception, pytest won't run
any more fixtures for ``test_order``, and it won't even try to run
``test_order`` itself. The only things that would've run would be ``order`` and
``append_first``.


Sharing test data
-----------------

If you want to make test data from files available to your tests, a good way
to do this is by loading these data in a fixture for use by your tests.
This makes use of the automatic caching mechanisms of pytest.

Another good approach is by adding the data files in the ``tests`` folder.
There are also community plugins available to help to manage this aspect of
testing, e.g. :pypi:`pytest-datadir` and :pypi:`pytest-datafiles`.

.. _fixtures-signal-cleanup:

A note about fixture cleanup
----------------------------

pytest does not do any special processing for :data:`SIGTERM <signal.SIGTERM>` and
``SIGQUIT`` signals (:data:`SIGINT <signal.SIGINT>` is handled naturally
by the Python runtime via :class:`KeyboardInterrupt`), so fixtures that manage external resources which are important
to be cleared when the Python process is terminated (by those signals) might leak resources.

The reason pytest does not handle those signals to perform fixture cleanup is that signal handlers are global,
and changing them might interfere with the code under execution.

If fixtures in your suite need special care regarding termination in those scenarios,
see :issue:`this comment <5243#issuecomment-491522595>` in the issue
tracker for a possible workaround.

Flaky tests
-----------

A "flaky" test is one that exhibits intermittent or sporadic failure, that seems to have non-deterministic behaviour. Sometimes it passes, sometimes it fails, and it's not clear why. This page discusses pytest features that can help and other general strategies for identifying, fixing or mitigating them.

Why flaky tests are a problem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Flaky tests are particularly troublesome when a continuous integration (CI) server is being used, so that all tests must pass before a new code change can be merged. If the test result is not a reliable signal -- that a test failure means the code change broke the test -- developers can become mistrustful of the test results, which can lead to overlooking genuine failures. It is also a source of wasted time as developers must re-run test suites and investigate spurious failures.


Potential root causes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

System state
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Broadly speaking, a flaky test indicates that the test relies on some system state that is not being appropriately controlled - the test environment is not sufficiently isolated. Higher level tests are more likely to be flaky as they rely on more state.

Flaky tests sometimes appear when a test suite is run in parallel (such as use of `pytest-xdist`_). This can indicate a test is reliant on test ordering.

-  Perhaps a different test is failing to clean up after itself and leaving behind data which causes the flaky test to fail.
- The flaky test is reliant on data from a previous test that doesn't clean up after itself, and in parallel runs that previous test is not always present
- Tests that modify global state typically cannot be run in parallel.


Overly strict assertion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overly strict assertions can cause problems with floating point comparison as well as timing issues. :func:`pytest.approx` is useful here.

Thread safety
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pytest is single-threaded, executing its tests always in the same thread, sequentially, never spawning any threads itself.

Even in case of plugins which run tests in parallel, for example `pytest-xdist`_, usually work by spawning multiple *processes* and running tests in batches, without using multiple threads.

It is of course possible (and common) for tests and fixtures to spawn threads themselves as part of their testing workflow (for example, a fixture that starts a server thread in the background, or a test which executes production code that spawns threads), but some care must be taken:

* Make sure to eventually wait on any spawned threads -- for example at the end of a test, or during the teardown of a fixture.
* Avoid using primitives provided by pytest (:func:`pytest.warns`, :func:`pytest.raises`, etc) from multiple threads, as they are not thread-safe.

If your test suite uses threads and your are seeing flaky test results, do not discount the possibility that the test is implicitly using global state in pytest itself.

Related features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Xfail strict
~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`pytest.mark.xfail ref` with ``strict=False`` can be used to mark a test so that its failure does not cause the whole build to break. This could be considered like a manual quarantine, and is rather dangerous to use permanently.


PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:envvar:`PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST` may be useful for figuring out "which test got stuck".
See :ref:`pytest current test env` for more details.


Plugins
~~~~~~~

Rerunning any failed tests can mitigate the negative effects of flaky tests by giving them additional chances to pass, so that the overall build does not fail. Several pytest plugins support this:

* `pytest-rerunfailures <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-rerunfailures>`_
* `pytest-replay <https://github.com/ESSS/pytest-replay>`_: This plugin helps to reproduce locally crashes or flaky tests observed during CI runs.
* `pytest-flakefinder <https://github.com/dropbox/pytest-flakefinder>`_ - `blog post <https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2016/03/open-sourcing-pytest-tools/>`_

Plugins to deliberately randomize tests can help expose tests with state problems:

* `pytest-random-order <https://github.com/jbasko/pytest-random-order>`_
* `pytest-randomly <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-randomly>`_


Other general strategies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Split up test suites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It can be common to split a single test suite into two, such as unit vs integration, and only use the unit test suite as a CI gate. This also helps keep build times manageable as high level tests tend to be slower. However, it means it does become possible for code that breaks the build to be merged, so extra vigilance is needed for monitoring the integration test results.


Video/screenshot on failure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For UI tests these are important for understanding what the state of the UI was when the test failed. pytest-splinter can be used with plugins like pytest-bdd and can `save a screenshot on test failure <https://pytest-splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#automatic-screenshots-on-test-failure>`_, which can help to isolate the cause.


Delete or rewrite the test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the functionality is covered by other tests, perhaps the test can be removed. If not, perhaps it can be rewritten at a lower level which will remove the flakiness or make its source more apparent.


Quarantine
~~~~~~~~~~

Mark Lapierre discusses the `Pros and Cons of Quarantined Tests <https://dev.to/mlapierre/pros-and-cons-of-quarantined-tests-2emj>`_ in a post from 2018.



CI tools that rerun on failure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Azure Pipelines (the Azure cloud CI/CD tool, formerly Visual Studio Team Services or VSTS) has a feature to `identify flaky tests <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/devops/2017/dec-11-vsts?view=tfs-2017#identify-flaky-tests>`_ and rerun failed tests.

.. _`goodpractices`:

Good Integration Practices
=================================================

Install package with pip
-------------------------------------------------

For development, we recommend you use :mod:`venv` for virtual environments and
:doc:`pip:index` for installing your application and any dependencies,
as well as the ``pytest`` package itself.
This ensures your code and dependencies are isolated from your system Python installation.

Create a ``pyproject.toml`` file in the root of your repository as described in
:doc:`packaging:tutorials/packaging-projects`.
The first few lines should look like this:

.. code-block:: toml

    [build-system]
    requires = ["hatchling"]
    build-backend = "hatchling.build"

    [project]
    name = "PACKAGENAME"
    version = "PACKAGEVERSION"

where ``PACKAGENAME`` and ``PACKAGEVERSION`` are the name and version of your package respectively.

You can then install your package in "editable" mode by running from the same directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e .

which lets you change your source code (both tests and application) and rerun tests at will.

.. _`test discovery`:
.. _`Python test discovery`:

Conventions for Python test discovery
-------------------------------------------------

``pytest`` implements the following standard test discovery:

* If no arguments are specified then collection starts from :confval:`testpaths`
  (if configured) or the current directory. Alternatively, command line arguments
  can be used in any combination of directories, file names or node ids.
* Recurse into directories, unless they match :confval:`norecursedirs`.
* In those directories, search for ``test_*.py`` or ``*_test.py`` files, imported by their `test package name`_.
* From those files, collect test items:

  * ``test`` prefixed test functions or methods outside of class.
  * ``test`` prefixed test functions or methods inside ``Test`` prefixed test classes (without an ``__init__`` method). Methods decorated with ``@staticmethod`` and ``@classmethods`` are also considered.

For examples of how to customize your test discovery :doc:`/example/pythoncollection`.

Within Python modules, ``pytest`` also discovers tests using the standard
:ref:`unittest.TestCase <unittest.TestCase>` subclassing technique.


.. _`test layout`:

Choosing a test layout
----------------------

``pytest`` supports two common test layouts:

Tests outside application code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Putting tests into an extra directory outside your actual application code
might be useful if you have many functional tests or for other reasons want
to keep tests separate from actual application code (often a good idea):

.. code-block:: text

    pyproject.toml
    src/
        mypkg/
            __init__.py
            app.py
            view.py
    tests/
        test_app.py
        test_view.py
        ...

This has the following benefits:

* Your tests can run against an installed version after executing ``pip install .``.
* Your tests can run against the local copy with an editable install after executing ``pip install --editable .``.

For new projects, we recommend to use ``importlib`` :ref:`import mode <import-modes>`
(see which-import-mode_ for a detailed explanation).
To this end, add the following to your ``pyproject.toml``:

.. code-block:: toml

    [tool.pytest.ini_options]
    addopts = [
        "--import-mode=importlib",
    ]

.. _src-layout:

Generally, but especially if you use the default import mode ``prepend``,
it is **strongly** suggested to use a ``src`` layout.
Here, your application root package resides in a sub-directory of your root,
i.e. ``src/mypkg/`` instead of ``mypkg``.

This layout prevents a lot of common pitfalls and has many benefits,
which are better explained in this excellent `blog post`_ by Ionel Cristian Mărieș.

.. _blog post: https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/#the-structure>

.. note::

    If you do not use an editable install and use the ``src`` layout as above you need to extend the Python's
    search path for module files to execute the tests against the local copy directly. You can do it in an
    ad-hoc manner by setting the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable:

    .. code-block:: bash

       PYTHONPATH=src pytest

    or in a permanent manner by using the :confval:`pythonpath` configuration variable and adding the
    following to your ``pyproject.toml``:

    .. code-block:: toml

        [tool.pytest.ini_options]
        pythonpath = "src"

.. note::

    If you do not use an editable install and not use the ``src`` layout (``mypkg`` directly in the root
    directory) you can rely on the fact that Python by default puts the current directory in ``sys.path`` to
    import your package and run ``python -m pytest`` to execute the tests against the local copy directly.

    See :ref:`pytest vs python -m pytest` for more information about the difference between calling ``pytest`` and
    ``python -m pytest``.

Tests as part of application code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inlining test directories into your application package
is useful if you have direct relation between tests and application modules and
want to distribute them along with your application:

.. code-block:: text

    pyproject.toml
    [src/]mypkg/
        __init__.py
        app.py
        view.py
        tests/
            __init__.py
            test_app.py
            test_view.py
            ...

In this scheme, it is easy to run your tests using the ``--pyargs`` option:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --pyargs mypkg

``pytest`` will discover where ``mypkg`` is installed and collect tests from there.

Note that this layout also works in conjunction with the ``src`` layout mentioned in the previous section.


.. note::

    You can use namespace packages (PEP420) for your application
    but pytest will still perform `test package name`_ discovery based on the
    presence of ``__init__.py`` files.  If you use one of the
    two recommended file system layouts above but leave away the ``__init__.py``
    files from your directories, it should just work.  From
    "inlined tests", however, you will need to use absolute imports for
    getting at your application code.

.. _`test package name`:

.. note::

    In ``prepend`` and ``append`` import-modes, if pytest finds a ``"a/b/test_module.py"``
    test file while recursing into the filesystem it determines the import name
    as follows:

    * determine ``basedir``: this is the first "upward" (towards the root)
      directory not containing an ``__init__.py``.  If e.g. both ``a``
      and ``b`` contain an ``__init__.py`` file then the parent directory
      of ``a`` will become the ``basedir``.

    * perform ``sys.path.insert(0, basedir)`` to make the test module
      importable under the fully qualified import name.

    * ``import a.b.test_module`` where the path is determined
      by converting path separators ``/`` into "." characters.  This means
      you must follow the convention of having directory and file
      names map directly to the import names.

    The reason for this somewhat evolved importing technique is
    that in larger projects multiple test modules might import
    from each other and thus deriving a canonical import name helps
    to avoid surprises such as a test module getting imported twice.

    With ``--import-mode=importlib`` things are less convoluted because
    pytest doesn't need to change ``sys.path``, making things much less
    surprising.


.. _which-import-mode:

Choosing an import mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For historical reasons, pytest defaults to the ``prepend`` :ref:`import mode <import-modes>`
instead of the ``importlib`` import mode we recommend for new projects.
The reason lies in the way the ``prepend`` mode works:

Since there are no packages to derive a full package name from,
``pytest`` will import your test files as *top-level* modules.
The test files in the first example (:ref:`src layout <src-layout>`) would be imported as
``test_app`` and ``test_view`` top-level modules by adding ``tests/`` to ``sys.path``.

This results in a drawback compared to the import mode ``importlib``:
your test files must have **unique names**.

If you need to have test modules with the same name,
as a workaround you might add ``__init__.py`` files to your ``tests`` folder and subfolders,
changing them to packages:

.. code-block:: text

    pyproject.toml
    mypkg/
        ...
    tests/
        __init__.py
        foo/
            __init__.py
            test_view.py
        bar/
            __init__.py
            test_view.py

Now pytest will load the modules as ``tests.foo.test_view`` and ``tests.bar.test_view``,
allowing you to have modules with the same name.
But now this introduces a subtle problem:
in order to load the test modules from the ``tests`` directory,
pytest prepends the root of the repository to ``sys.path``,
which adds the side-effect that now ``mypkg`` is also importable.

This is problematic if you are using a tool like tox_ to test your package in a virtual environment,
because you want to test the *installed* version of your package,
not the local code from the repository.

The ``importlib`` import mode does not have any of the drawbacks above,
because ``sys.path`` is not changed when importing test modules.


.. _`buildout`: http://www.buildout.org/en/latest/

.. _`use tox`:

tox
---

Once you are done with your work and want to make sure that your actual
package passes all tests you may want to look into :doc:`tox <tox:index>`, the
virtualenv test automation tool.
``tox`` helps you to setup virtualenv environments with pre-defined
dependencies and then executing a pre-configured test command with
options.  It will run tests against the installed package and not
against your source code checkout, helping to detect packaging
glitches.

Do not run via setuptools
-------------------------

Integration with setuptools is **not recommended**,
i.e. you should not be using ``python setup.py test`` or ``pytest-runner``,
and may stop working in the future.

This is deprecated since it depends on deprecated features of setuptools
and relies on features that break security mechanisms in pip.
For example 'setup_requires' and 'tests_require' bypass ``pip --require-hashes``.
For more information and migration instructions,
see the `pytest-runner notice <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-runner#deprecation-notice>`_.
See also `pypa/setuptools#1684 <https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/1684>`_.

setuptools intends to
`remove the test command <https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/931>`_.

Checking with flake8-pytest-style
---------------------------------

In order to ensure that pytest is being used correctly in your project,
it can be helpful to use the `flake8-pytest-style <https://github.com/m-burst/flake8-pytest-style>`_ flake8 plugin.

flake8-pytest-style checks for common mistakes and coding style violations in pytest code,
such as incorrect use of fixtures, test function names, and markers.
By using this plugin, you can catch these errors early in the development process
and ensure that your pytest code is consistent and easy to maintain.

A list of the lints detected by flake8-pytest-style can be found on its `PyPI page <https://pypi.org/project/flake8-pytest-style/>`_.

.. note::

    flake8-pytest-style is not an official pytest project. Some of the rules enforce certain style choices, such as using `@pytest.fixture()` over `@pytest.fixture`, but you can configure the plugin to fit your preferred style.

pytest import mechanisms and ``sys.path``/``PYTHONPATH``
========================================================

.. _`import-modes`:

Import modes
------------

pytest as a testing framework needs to import test modules and ``conftest.py`` files for execution.

Importing files in Python is a non-trivial process, so aspects of the
import process can be controlled through the ``--import-mode`` command-line flag, which can assume
these values:

.. _`import-mode-prepend`:

* ``prepend`` (default): The directory path containing each module will be inserted into the *beginning*
  of :py:data:`sys.path` if not already there, and then imported with
  the :func:`importlib.import_module <importlib.import_module>` function.

  It is highly recommended to arrange your test modules as packages by adding ``__init__.py`` files to your directories
  containing tests. This will make the tests part of a proper Python package, allowing pytest to resolve their full
  name (for example ``tests.core.test_core`` for ``test_core.py`` inside the ``tests.core`` package).

  If the test directory tree is not arranged as packages, then each test file needs to have a unique name
  compared to the other test files, otherwise pytest will raise an error if it finds two tests with the same name.

  This is the classic mechanism, dating back from the time Python 2 was still supported.

.. _`import-mode-append`:

* ``append``: the directory containing each module is appended to the end of :py:data:`sys.path` if not already
  there, and imported with :func:`importlib.import_module <importlib.import_module>`.

  This better allows users to run test modules against installed versions of a package even if the
  package under test has the same import root. For example:

  ::

        testing/__init__.py
        testing/test_pkg_under_test.py
        pkg_under_test/

  the tests will run against the installed version
  of ``pkg_under_test`` when ``--import-mode=append`` is used whereas
  with ``prepend``, they would pick up the local version. This kind of confusion is why
  we advocate for using :ref:`src-layouts <src-layout>`.

  Same as ``prepend``, requires test module names to be unique when the test directory tree is
  not arranged in packages, because the modules will put in :py:data:`sys.modules` after importing.

.. _`import-mode-importlib`:

* ``importlib``: this mode uses more fine control mechanisms provided by :mod:`importlib` to import test modules, without changing :py:data:`sys.path`.

  Advantages of this mode:

  * pytest will not change :py:data:`sys.path` at all.
  * Test module names do not need to be unique -- pytest will generate a unique name automatically based on the ``rootdir``.

  Disadvantages:

  * Test modules can't import each other.
  * Testing utility modules in the tests directories (for example a ``tests.helpers`` module containing test-related functions/classes)
    are not importable. The recommendation in this case it to place testing utility modules together with the application/library
    code, for example ``app.testing.helpers``.

    Important: by "test utility modules", we mean functions/classes which are imported by
    other tests directly; this does not include fixtures, which should be placed in ``conftest.py`` files, along
    with the test modules, and are discovered automatically by pytest.

  It works like this:

  1. Given a certain module path, for example ``tests/core/test_models.py``, derives a canonical name
     like ``tests.core.test_models`` and tries to import it.

     For non-test modules, this will work if they are accessible via :py:data:`sys.path`. So
     for example, ``.env/lib/site-packages/app/core.py`` will be importable as ``app.core``.
     This happens when plugins import non-test modules (for example doctesting).

     If this step succeeds, the module is returned.

     For test modules, unless they are reachable from :py:data:`sys.path`, this step will fail.

  2. If the previous step fails, we import the module directly using ``importlib`` facilities, which lets us import it without
     changing :py:data:`sys.path`.

     Because Python requires the module to also be available in :py:data:`sys.modules`, pytest derives a unique name for it based
     on its relative location from the ``rootdir``, and adds the module to :py:data:`sys.modules`.

     For example, ``tests/core/test_models.py`` will end up being imported as the module ``tests.core.test_models``.

  .. versionadded:: 6.0

.. note::

    Initially we intended to make ``importlib`` the default in future releases, however it is clear now that
    it has its own set of drawbacks so the default will remain ``prepend`` for the foreseeable future.

.. note::

    By default, pytest will not attempt to resolve namespace packages automatically, but that can
    be changed via the :confval:`consider_namespace_packages` configuration variable.

.. seealso::

    The :confval:`pythonpath` configuration variable.

``prepend`` and ``append`` import modes scenarios
-------------------------------------------------

Here's a list of scenarios when using ``prepend`` or ``append`` import modes where pytest needs to
change :py:data:`sys.path` in order to import test modules or ``conftest.py`` files, and the issues users
might encounter because of that.

Test modules / ``conftest.py`` files inside packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consider this file and directory layout::

    root/
    |- foo/
       |- __init__.py
       |- conftest.py
       |- bar/
          |- __init__.py
          |- tests/
             |- __init__.py
             |- test_foo.py


When executing:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest root/

pytest will find ``foo/bar/tests/test_foo.py`` and realize it is part of a package given that
there's an ``__init__.py`` file in the same folder. It will then search upwards until it can find the
last folder which still contains an ``__init__.py`` file in order to find the package *root* (in
this case ``foo/``). To load the module, it will insert ``root/``  to the front of
:py:data:`sys.path` (if not there already) in order to load
``test_foo.py`` as the *module* ``foo.bar.tests.test_foo``.

The same logic applies to the ``conftest.py`` file: it will be imported as ``foo.conftest`` module.

Preserving the full package name is important when tests live in a package to avoid problems
and allow test modules to have duplicated names. This is also discussed in details in
:ref:`test discovery`.

Standalone test modules / ``conftest.py`` files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consider this file and directory layout::

    root/
    |- foo/
       |- conftest.py
       |- bar/
          |- tests/
             |- test_foo.py


When executing:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest root/

pytest will find ``foo/bar/tests/test_foo.py`` and realize it is NOT part of a package given that
there's no ``__init__.py`` file in the same folder. It will then add ``root/foo/bar/tests`` to
:py:data:`sys.path` in order to import ``test_foo.py`` as the *module* ``test_foo``. The same is done
with the ``conftest.py`` file by adding ``root/foo`` to :py:data:`sys.path` to import it as ``conftest``.

For this reason this layout cannot have test modules with the same name, as they all will be
imported in the global import namespace.

This is also discussed in details in :ref:`test discovery`.

.. _`pytest vs python -m pytest`:

Invoking ``pytest`` versus ``python -m pytest``
-----------------------------------------------

Running pytest with ``pytest [...]`` instead of ``python -m pytest [...]`` yields nearly
equivalent behaviour, except that the latter will add the current directory to :py:data:`sys.path`, which
is standard ``python`` behavior.

See also :ref:`invoke-python`.

.. _types:

Typing in pytest
================

.. note::
    This page assumes the reader is familiar with Python's typing system and its advantages.

    For more information, refer to `Python's Typing Documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html>`_.

Why type tests?
---------------

Typing tests provides significant advantages:

- **Readability:** Clearly defines expected inputs and outputs, improving readability, especially in complex or parameterized tests.

- **Refactoring:** This is the main benefit in typing tests, as it will greatly help with refactoring, letting the type checker point out the necessary changes in both production and tests, without needing to run the full test suite.

For production code, typing also helps catching some bugs that might not be caught by tests at all (regardless of coverage), for example:

.. code-block:: python

    def get_caption(target: int, items: list[tuple[int, str]]) -> str:
        for value, caption in items:
            if value == target:
                return caption


The type checker will correctly error out that the function might return `None`, however even a full coverage test suite might miss that case:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_get_caption() -> None:
        assert get_caption(10, [(1, "foo"), (10, "bar")]) == "bar"


Note the code above has 100% coverage, but the bug is not caught (of course the example is "obvious", but serves to illustrate the point).



Using typing in test suites
---------------------------

To type fixtures in pytest, just add normal types to the fixture functions -- there is nothing special that needs to be done just because of the `fixture` decorator.

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture
    def sample_fixture() -> int:
        return 38

In the same manner, the fixtures passed to test functions need be annotated with the fixture's return type:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_sample_fixture(sample_fixture: int) -> None:
        assert sample_fixture == 38

From the POV of the type checker, it does not matter that `sample_fixture` is actually a fixture managed by pytest, all it matters to it is that `sample_fixture` is a parameter of type `int`.


The same logic applies to :ref:`@pytest.mark.parametrize <@pytest.mark.parametrize>`:

.. code-block:: python


    @pytest.mark.parametrize("input_value, expected_output", [(1, 2), (5, 6), (10, 11)])
    def test_increment(input_value: int, expected_output: int) -> None:
        assert input_value + 1 == expected_output


The same logic applies when typing fixture functions which receive other fixtures:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_env_user(monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch) -> None:
        monkeypatch.setenv("USER", "TestingUser")


Conclusion
----------

Incorporating typing into pytest tests enhances **clarity**, improves **debugging** and **maintenance**, and ensures **type safety**.
These practices lead to a **robust**, **readable**, and **easily maintainable** test suite that is better equipped to handle future changes with minimal risk of errors.

.. _`assert`:

How to write and report assertions in tests
==================================================

.. _`assert with the assert statement`:

Asserting with the ``assert`` statement
---------------------------------------------------------

``pytest`` allows you to use the standard Python ``assert`` for verifying
expectations and values in Python tests.  For example, you can write the
following:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_assert1.py
    def f():
        return 3


    def test_function():
        assert f() == 4

to assert that your function returns a certain value. If this assertion fails
you will see the return value of the function call:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest test_assert1.py
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 1 item

    test_assert1.py F                                                    [100%]

    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    ______________________________ test_function _______________________________

        def test_function():
    >       assert f() == 4
    E       assert 3 == 4
    E        +  where 3 = f()

    test_assert1.py:6: AssertionError
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_assert1.py::test_function - assert 3 == 4
    ============================ 1 failed in 0.12s =============================

``pytest`` has support for showing the values of the most common subexpressions
including calls, attributes, comparisons, and binary and unary
operators. (See :ref:`tbreportdemo`).  This allows you to use the
idiomatic python constructs without boilerplate code while not losing
introspection information.

If a message is specified with the assertion like this:

.. code-block:: python

    assert a % 2 == 0, "value was odd, should be even"

it is printed alongside the assertion introspection in the traceback.

See :ref:`assert-details` for more information on assertion introspection.

.. _`assertraises`:

Assertions about expected exceptions
------------------------------------------

In order to write assertions about raised exceptions, you can use
:func:`pytest.raises` as a context manager like this:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    def test_zero_division():
        with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):
            1 / 0

and if you need to have access to the actual exception info you may use:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_recursion_depth():
        with pytest.raises(RuntimeError) as excinfo:

            def f():
                f()

            f()
        assert "maximum recursion" in str(excinfo.value)

``excinfo`` is an :class:`~pytest.ExceptionInfo` instance, which is a wrapper around
the actual exception raised.  The main attributes of interest are
``.type``, ``.value`` and ``.traceback``.

Note that ``pytest.raises`` will match the exception type or any subclasses (like the standard ``except`` statement).
If you want to check if a block of code is raising an exact exception type, you need to check that explicitly:


.. code-block:: python

    def test_foo_not_implemented():
        def foo():
            raise NotImplementedError

        with pytest.raises(RuntimeError) as excinfo:
            foo()
        assert excinfo.type is RuntimeError

The :func:`pytest.raises` call will succeed, even though the function raises :class:`NotImplementedError`, because
:class:`NotImplementedError` is a subclass of :class:`RuntimeError`; however the following `assert` statement will
catch the problem.

Matching exception messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can pass a ``match`` keyword parameter to the context-manager to test
that a regular expression matches on the string representation of an exception
(similar to the ``TestCase.assertRaisesRegex`` method from ``unittest``):

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    def myfunc():
        raise ValueError("Exception 123 raised")


    def test_match():
        with pytest.raises(ValueError, match=r".* 123 .*"):
            myfunc()

Notes:

* The ``match`` parameter is matched with the :func:`re.search`
  function, so in the above example ``match='123'`` would have worked as well.
* The ``match`` parameter also matches against `PEP-678 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0678/>`__ ``__notes__``.


.. _`assert-matching-exception-groups`:

Assertions about expected exception groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When expecting a :exc:`BaseExceptionGroup` or :exc:`ExceptionGroup` you can use :class:`pytest.RaisesGroup`:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_exception_in_group():
        with pytest.RaisesGroup(ValueError):
            raise ExceptionGroup("group msg", [ValueError("value msg")])
        with pytest.RaisesGroup(ValueError, TypeError):
            raise ExceptionGroup("msg", [ValueError("foo"), TypeError("bar")])


It accepts a ``match`` parameter, that checks against the group message, and a ``check`` parameter that takes an arbitrary callable which it passes the group to, and only succeeds if the callable returns ``True``.

.. code-block:: python

    def test_raisesgroup_match_and_check():
        with pytest.RaisesGroup(BaseException, match="my group msg"):
            raise BaseExceptionGroup("my group msg", [KeyboardInterrupt()])
        with pytest.RaisesGroup(
            Exception, check=lambda eg: isinstance(eg.__cause__, ValueError)
        ):
            raise ExceptionGroup("", [TypeError()]) from ValueError()

It is strict about structure and unwrapped exceptions, unlike :ref:`except* <except_star>`, so you might want to set the ``flatten_subgroups`` and/or ``allow_unwrapped`` parameters.

.. code-block:: python

    def test_structure():
        with pytest.RaisesGroup(pytest.RaisesGroup(ValueError)):
            raise ExceptionGroup("", (ExceptionGroup("", (ValueError(),)),))
        with pytest.RaisesGroup(ValueError, flatten_subgroups=True):
            raise ExceptionGroup("1st group", [ExceptionGroup("2nd group", [ValueError()])])
        with pytest.RaisesGroup(ValueError, allow_unwrapped=True):
            raise ValueError

To specify more details about the contained exception you can use :class:`pytest.RaisesExc`

.. code-block:: python

    def test_raises_exc():
        with pytest.RaisesGroup(pytest.RaisesExc(ValueError, match="foo")):
            raise ExceptionGroup("", (ValueError("foo")))

They both supply a method :meth:`pytest.RaisesGroup.matches` :meth:`pytest.RaisesExc.matches` if you want to do matching outside of using it as a contextmanager. This can be helpful when checking ``.__context__`` or ``.__cause__``.

.. code-block:: python

    def test_matches():
        exc = ValueError()
        exc_group = ExceptionGroup("", [exc])
        if RaisesGroup(ValueError).matches(exc_group):
            ...
        # helpful error is available in `.fail_reason` if it fails to match
        r = RaisesExc(ValueError)
        assert r.matches(e), r.fail_reason

Check the documentation on :class:`pytest.RaisesGroup` and :class:`pytest.RaisesExc` for more details and examples.

``ExceptionInfo.group_contains()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   This helper makes it easy to check for the presence of specific exceptions, but it is very bad for checking that the group does *not* contain *any other exceptions*. So this will pass:

    .. code-block:: python

       class EXTREMELYBADERROR(BaseException):
           """This is a very bad error to miss"""


       def test_for_value_error():
           with pytest.raises(ExceptionGroup) as excinfo:
               excs = [ValueError()]
               if very_unlucky():
                   excs.append(EXTREMELYBADERROR())
               raise ExceptionGroup("", excs)
           # This passes regardless of if there's other exceptions.
           assert excinfo.group_contains(ValueError)
           # You can't simply list all exceptions you *don't* want to get here.


   There is no good way of using :func:`excinfo.group_contains() <pytest.ExceptionInfo.group_contains>` to ensure you're not getting *any* other exceptions than the one you expected.
   You should instead use :class:`pytest.RaisesGroup`, see :ref:`assert-matching-exception-groups`.

You can also use the :func:`excinfo.group_contains() <pytest.ExceptionInfo.group_contains>`
method to test for exceptions returned as part of an :class:`ExceptionGroup`:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_exception_in_group():
        with pytest.raises(ExceptionGroup) as excinfo:
            raise ExceptionGroup(
                "Group message",
                [
                    RuntimeError("Exception 123 raised"),
                ],
            )
        assert excinfo.group_contains(RuntimeError, match=r".* 123 .*")
        assert not excinfo.group_contains(TypeError)

The optional ``match`` keyword parameter works the same way as for
:func:`pytest.raises`.

By default ``group_contains()`` will recursively search for a matching
exception at any level of nested ``ExceptionGroup`` instances. You can
specify a ``depth`` keyword parameter if you only want to match an
exception at a specific level; exceptions contained directly in the top
``ExceptionGroup`` would match ``depth=1``.

.. code-block:: python

    def test_exception_in_group_at_given_depth():
        with pytest.raises(ExceptionGroup) as excinfo:
            raise ExceptionGroup(
                "Group message",
                [
                    RuntimeError(),
                    ExceptionGroup(
                        "Nested group",
                        [
                            TypeError(),
                        ],
                    ),
                ],
            )
        assert excinfo.group_contains(RuntimeError, depth=1)
        assert excinfo.group_contains(TypeError, depth=2)
        assert not excinfo.group_contains(RuntimeError, depth=2)
        assert not excinfo.group_contains(TypeError, depth=1)

Alternate `pytest.raises` form (legacy)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is an alternate form of :func:`pytest.raises` where you pass
a function that will be executed, along with ``*args`` and ``**kwargs``. :func:`pytest.raises`
will then execute the function with those arguments and assert that the given exception is raised:

.. code-block:: python

    def func(x):
        if x <= 0:
            raise ValueError("x needs to be larger than zero")


    pytest.raises(ValueError, func, x=-1)

The reporter will provide you with helpful output in case of failures such as *no
exception* or *wrong exception*.

This form was the original :func:`pytest.raises` API, developed before the ``with`` statement was
added to the Python language. Nowadays, this form is rarely used, with the context-manager form (using ``with``)
being considered more readable.
Nonetheless, this form is fully supported and not deprecated in any way.

xfail mark and pytest.raises
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is also possible to specify a ``raises`` argument to
:ref:`pytest.mark.xfail <pytest.mark.xfail ref>`, which checks that the test is failing in a more
specific way than just having any exception raised:

.. code-block:: python

    def f():
        raise IndexError()


    @pytest.mark.xfail(raises=IndexError)
    def test_f():
        f()


This will only "xfail" if the test fails by raising ``IndexError`` or subclasses.

* Using :ref:`pytest.mark.xfail <pytest.mark.xfail ref>` with the ``raises`` parameter is probably better for something
  like documenting unfixed bugs (where the test describes what "should" happen) or bugs in dependencies.

* Using :func:`pytest.raises` is likely to be better for cases where you are
  testing exceptions your own code is deliberately raising, which is the majority of cases.

You can also use :class:`pytest.RaisesGroup`:

.. code-block:: python

    def f():
        raise ExceptionGroup("", [IndexError()])


    @pytest.mark.xfail(raises=RaisesGroup(IndexError))
    def test_f():
        f()


.. _`assertwarns`:

Assertions about expected warnings
-----------------------------------------



You can check that code raises a particular warning using
:ref:`pytest.warns <warns>`.


.. _newreport:

Making use of context-sensitive comparisons
-------------------------------------------------



``pytest`` has rich support for providing context-sensitive information
when it encounters comparisons.  For example:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_assert2.py
    def test_set_comparison():
        set1 = set("1308")
        set2 = set("8035")
        assert set1 == set2

if you run this module:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest test_assert2.py
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 1 item

    test_assert2.py F                                                    [100%]

    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    ___________________________ test_set_comparison ____________________________

        def test_set_comparison():
            set1 = set("1308")
            set2 = set("8035")
    >       assert set1 == set2
    E       AssertionError: assert {'0', '1', '3', '8'} == {'0', '3', '5', '8'}
    E
    E         Extra items in the left set:
    E         '1'
    E         Extra items in the right set:
    E         '5'
    E         Use -v to get more diff

    test_assert2.py:4: AssertionError
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_assert2.py::test_set_comparison - AssertionError: assert {'0'...
    ============================ 1 failed in 0.12s =============================

Special comparisons are done for a number of cases:

* comparing long strings: a context diff is shown
* comparing long sequences: first failing indices
* comparing dicts: different entries

See the :ref:`reporting demo <tbreportdemo>` for many more examples.

Defining your own explanation for failed assertions
---------------------------------------------------

It is possible to add your own detailed explanations by implementing
the ``pytest_assertrepr_compare`` hook.

.. autofunction:: _pytest.hookspec.pytest_assertrepr_compare
   :noindex:

As an example consider adding the following hook in a :ref:`conftest.py <conftest.py>`
file which provides an alternative explanation for ``Foo`` objects:

.. code-block:: python

   # content of conftest.py
   from test_foocompare import Foo


   def pytest_assertrepr_compare(op, left, right):
       if isinstance(left, Foo) and isinstance(right, Foo) and op == "==":
           return [
               "Comparing Foo instances:",
               f"   vals: {left.val} != {right.val}",
           ]

now, given this test module:

.. code-block:: python

   # content of test_foocompare.py
   class Foo:
       def __init__(self, val):
           self.val = val

       def __eq__(self, other):
           return self.val == other.val


   def test_compare():
       f1 = Foo(1)
       f2 = Foo(2)
       assert f1 == f2

you can run the test module and get the custom output defined in
the conftest file:

.. code-block:: pytest

   $ pytest -q test_foocompare.py
   F                                                                    [100%]
   ================================= FAILURES =================================
   _______________________________ test_compare _______________________________

       def test_compare():
           f1 = Foo(1)
           f2 = Foo(2)
   >       assert f1 == f2
   E       assert Comparing Foo instances:
   E            vals: 1 != 2

   test_foocompare.py:12: AssertionError
   ========================= short test summary info ==========================
   FAILED test_foocompare.py::test_compare - assert Comparing Foo instances:
   1 failed in 0.12s

.. _`return-not-none`:

Returning non-None value in test functions
------------------------------------------

A :class:`pytest.PytestReturnNotNoneWarning` is emitted when a test function returns a value other than ``None``.

This helps prevent a common mistake made by beginners who assume that returning a ``bool`` (e.g., ``True`` or ``False``) will determine whether a test passes or fails.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.parametrize(
        ["a", "b", "result"],
        [
            [1, 2, 5],
            [2, 3, 8],
            [5, 3, 18],
        ],
    )
    def test_foo(a, b, result):
        return foo(a, b) == result  # Incorrect usage, do not do this.

Since pytest ignores return values, it might be surprising that the test will never fail based on the returned value.

The correct fix is to replace the ``return`` statement with an ``assert``:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.parametrize(
        ["a", "b", "result"],
        [
            [1, 2, 5],
            [2, 3, 8],
            [5, 3, 18],
        ],
    )
    def test_foo(a, b, result):
        assert foo(a, b) == result




.. _assert-details:
.. _`assert introspection`:

Assertion introspection details
-------------------------------


Reporting details about a failing assertion is achieved by rewriting assert
statements before they are run.  Rewritten assert statements put introspection
information into the assertion failure message.  ``pytest`` only rewrites test
modules directly discovered by its test collection process, so **asserts in
supporting modules which are not themselves test modules will not be rewritten**.

You can manually enable assertion rewriting for an imported module by calling
:ref:`register_assert_rewrite <assertion-rewriting>`
before you import it (a good place to do that is in your root ``conftest.py``).

For further information, Benjamin Peterson wrote up `Behind the scenes of pytest's new assertion rewriting <http://pybites.blogspot.com/2011/07/behind-scenes-of-pytests-new-assertion.html>`_.

Assertion rewriting caches files on disk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``pytest`` will write back the rewritten modules to disk for caching. You can disable
this behavior (for example to avoid leaving stale ``.pyc`` files around in projects that
move files around a lot) by adding this to the top of your ``conftest.py`` file:

.. code-block:: python

   import sys

   sys.dont_write_bytecode = True

Note that you still get the benefits of assertion introspection, the only change is that
the ``.pyc`` files won't be cached on disk.

Additionally, rewriting will silently skip caching if it cannot write new ``.pyc`` files,
e.g. in a read-only filesystem or a zipfile.


Disabling assert rewriting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``pytest`` rewrites test modules on import by using an import
hook to write new ``pyc`` files. Most of the time this works transparently.
However, if you are working with the import machinery yourself, the import hook may
interfere.

If this is the case you have two options:

* Disable rewriting for a specific module by adding the string
  ``PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE`` to its docstring.

* Disable rewriting for all modules by using ``--assert=plain``.

.. _bash_completion:

How to set up bash completion
=============================

When using bash as your shell, ``pytest`` can use argcomplete
(https://kislyuk.github.io/argcomplete/) for auto-completion.
For this ``argcomplete`` needs to be installed **and** enabled.

Install argcomplete using:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo pip install 'argcomplete>=0.5.7'

For global activation of all argcomplete enabled python applications run:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete

For permanent (but not global) ``pytest`` activation, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    register-python-argcomplete pytest >> ~/.bashrc

For one-time activation of argcomplete for ``pytest`` only, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    eval "$(register-python-argcomplete pytest)"

.. _`cache_provider`:
.. _cache:


How to re-run failed tests and maintain state between test runs
===============================================================



Usage
---------

The plugin provides two command line options to rerun failures from the
last ``pytest`` invocation:

* ``--lf``, ``--last-failed`` - to only re-run the failures.
* ``--ff``, ``--failed-first`` - to run the failures first and then the rest of
  the tests.

For cleanup (usually not needed), a ``--cache-clear`` option allows to remove
all cross-session cache contents ahead of a test run.

Other plugins may access the `config.cache`_ object to set/get
**json encodable** values between ``pytest`` invocations.

.. note::

    This plugin is enabled by default, but can be disabled if needed: see
    :ref:`cmdunregister` (the internal name for this plugin is
    ``cacheprovider``).


Rerunning only failures or failures first
-----------------------------------------------

First, let's create 50 test invocation of which only 2 fail:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_50.py
    import pytest


    @pytest.mark.parametrize("i", range(50))
    def test_num(i):
        if i in (17, 25):
            pytest.fail("bad luck")

If you run this for the first time you will see two failures:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q
    .................F.......F........................                   [100%]
    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    _______________________________ test_num[17] _______________________________

    i = 17

        @pytest.mark.parametrize("i", range(50))
        def test_num(i):
            if i in (17, 25):
    >           pytest.fail("bad luck")
    E           Failed: bad luck

    test_50.py:7: Failed
    _______________________________ test_num[25] _______________________________

    i = 25

        @pytest.mark.parametrize("i", range(50))
        def test_num(i):
            if i in (17, 25):
    >           pytest.fail("bad luck")
    E           Failed: bad luck

    test_50.py:7: Failed
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_50.py::test_num[17] - Failed: bad luck
    FAILED test_50.py::test_num[25] - Failed: bad luck
    2 failed, 48 passed in 0.12s

If you then run it with ``--lf``:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest --lf
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project

    run-last-failure: rerun previous 2 failures

    test_50.py FF                                                        [100%]

    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    _______________________________ test_num[17] _______________________________

    i = 17

        @pytest.mark.parametrize("i", range(50))
        def test_num(i):
            if i in (17, 25):
    >           pytest.fail("bad luck")
    E           Failed: bad luck

    test_50.py:7: Failed
    _______________________________ test_num[25] _______________________________

    i = 25

        @pytest.mark.parametrize("i", range(50))
        def test_num(i):
            if i in (17, 25):
    >           pytest.fail("bad luck")
    E           Failed: bad luck

    test_50.py:7: Failed

    FAILED test_50.py::test_num[25] - Failed: bad luck
    ============================ 2 failed in 0.12s =============================

You have run only the two failing tests from the last run, while the 48 passing
tests have not been run ("deselected").

Now, if you run with the ``--ff`` option, all tests will be run but the first
previous failures will be executed first (as can be seen from the series
of ``FF`` and dots):

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest --ff
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project

    test_50.py FF................................................        [100%]

    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    _______________________________ test_num[17] _______________________________

    i = 17

        @pytest.mark.parametrize("i", range(50))
        def test_num(i):
            if i in (17, 25):
    >           pytest.fail("bad luck")
    E           Failed: bad luck

    test_50.py:7: Failed
    _______________________________ test_num[25] _______________________________

    i = 25

        @pytest.mark.parametrize("i", range(50))

.. _`config.cache`:

New ``--nf``, ``--new-first`` options: run new tests first followed by the rest
of the tests, in both cases tests are also sorted by the file modified time,
with more recent files coming first.

Behavior when no tests failed in the last run
---------------------------------------------

The ``--lfnf/--last-failed-no-failures`` option governs the behavior of ``--last-failed``.
Determines whether to execute tests when there are no previously (known)
failures or when no cached ``lastfailed`` data was found.

There are two options:

* ``all``:  when there are no known test failures, runs all tests (the full test suite). This is the default.
* ``none``: when there are no known test failures, just emits a message stating this and exit successfully.

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --last-failed --last-failed-no-failures all    # runs the full test suite (default behavior)
    pytest --last-failed --last-failed-no-failures none   # runs no tests and exits successfully

The new config.cache object
--------------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

Plugins or conftest.py support code can get a cached value using the
pytest ``config`` object.  Here is a basic example plugin which
implements a :ref:`fixture <fixture>` which reuses previously created state
across pytest invocations:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_caching.py
    import pytest


    def expensive_computation():
        print("running expensive computation...")


    @pytest.fixture
    def mydata(pytestconfig):
        val = pytestconfig.cache.get("example/value", None)
        if val is None:
            expensive_computation()
            val = 42
            pytestconfig.cache.set("example/value", val)
        return val


    def test_function(mydata):
        assert mydata == 23

If you run this command for the first time, you can see the print statement:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q
    F                                                                    [100%]
    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    ______________________________ test_function _______________________________

    mydata = 42

        def test_function(mydata):
    >       assert mydata == 23
    E       assert 42 == 23

    test_caching.py:19: AssertionError
    -------------------------- Captured stdout setup ---------------------------
    running expensive computation...
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_caching.py::test_function - assert 42 == 23
    1 failed in 0.12s

If you run it a second time, the value will be retrieved from
the cache and nothing will be printed:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q
    F                                                                    [100%]
    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    ______________________________ test_function _______________________________

    mydata = 42

        def test_function(mydata):
    >       assert mydata == 23
    E       assert 42 == 23

    test_caching.py:19: AssertionError
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_caching.py::test_function - assert 42 == 23
    1 failed in 0.12s

See the :fixture:`config.cache fixture <cache>` for more details.


Inspecting Cache content
------------------------

You can always peek at the content of the cache using the
``--cache-show`` command line option:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest --cache-show
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    cachedir: /home/sweet/project/.pytest_cache
    --------------------------- cache values for '*' ---------------------------
    cache/lastfailed contains:
      {'test_caching.py::test_function': True}
    cache/nodeids contains:
      ['test_caching.py::test_function']
    example/value contains:
      42

    ========================== no tests ran in 0.12s ===========================

``--cache-show`` takes an optional argument to specify a glob pattern for
filtering:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest --cache-show example/*
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    cachedir: /home/sweet/project/.pytest_cache
    ----------------------- cache values for 'example/*' -----------------------
    example/value contains:
      42

    ========================== no tests ran in 0.12s ===========================

Clearing Cache content
----------------------

You can instruct pytest to clear all cache files and values
by adding the ``--cache-clear`` option like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --cache-clear

This is recommended for invocations from Continuous Integration
servers where isolation and correctness is more important
than speed.


.. _cache stepwise:

Stepwise
--------

As an alternative to ``--lf -x``, especially for cases where you expect a large part of the test suite will fail, ``--sw``, ``--stepwise`` allows you to fix them one at a time. The test suite will run until the first failure and then stop. At the next invocation, tests will continue from the last failing test and then run until the next failing test. You may use the ``--stepwise-skip`` option to ignore one failing test and stop the test execution on the second failing test instead. This is useful if you get stuck on a failing test and just want to ignore it until later.  Providing ``--stepwise-skip`` will also enable ``--stepwise`` implicitly.

## File: doc/en/how-to/capture-stdout-stderr.rst
````
.. _`captures`:

How to capture stdout/stderr output
=========================================================

Pytest intercepts stdout and stderr as configured by the ``--capture=``
command-line argument or by using fixtures. The ``--capture=`` flag configures
reporting, whereas the fixtures offer more granular control and allows
inspection of output during testing. The reports can be customized with the
`-r flag <../reference/reference.html#command-line-flags>`_.

Default stdout/stderr/stdin capturing behaviour
---------------------------------------------------------

During test execution any output sent to ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` is
captured.  If a test or a setup method fails its according captured
output will usually be shown along with the failure traceback. (this
behavior can be configured by the ``--show-capture`` command-line option).

In addition, ``stdin`` is set to a "null" object which will
fail on attempts to read from it because it is rarely desired
to wait for interactive input when running automated tests.

By default capturing is done by intercepting writes to low level
file descriptors.  This allows to capture output from simple
print statements as well as output from a subprocess started by
a test.

.. _capture-method:

Setting capturing methods or disabling capturing
-------------------------------------------------

There are three ways in which ``pytest`` can perform capturing:

* ``fd`` (file descriptor) level capturing (default): All writes going to the
  operating system file descriptors 1 and 2 will be captured.

* ``sys`` level capturing: Only writes to Python files ``sys.stdout``
  and ``sys.stderr`` will be captured.  No capturing of writes to
  filedescriptors is performed.

* ``tee-sys`` capturing: Python writes to ``sys.stdout`` and ``sys.stderr``
  will be captured, however the writes will also be passed-through to
  the actual ``sys.stdout`` and ``sys.stderr``. This allows output to be
  'live printed' and captured for plugin use, such as junitxml (new in pytest 5.4).

.. _`disable capturing`:

You can influence output capturing mechanisms from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -s                  # disable all capturing
    pytest --capture=sys       # replace sys.stdout/stderr with in-mem files
    pytest --capture=fd        # also point filedescriptors 1 and 2 to temp file
    pytest --capture=tee-sys   # combines 'sys' and '-s', capturing sys.stdout/stderr
                               # and passing it along to the actual sys.stdout/stderr

.. _printdebugging:

Using print statements for debugging
---------------------------------------------------

One primary benefit of the default capturing of stdout/stderr output
is that you can use print statements for debugging:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_module.py


    def setup_function(function):
        print("setting up", function)


    def test_func1():
        assert True


    def test_func2():
        assert False

and running this module will show you precisely the output
of the failing function and hide the other one:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 2 items

    test_module.py .F                                                    [100%]

    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    ________________________________ test_func2 ________________________________

        def test_func2():
    >       assert False
    E       assert False

    test_module.py:12: AssertionError
    -------------------------- Captured stdout setup ---------------------------
    setting up <function test_func2 at 0xdeadbeef0001>
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_module.py::test_func2 - assert False
    ======================= 1 failed, 1 passed in 0.12s ========================

Accessing captured output from a test function
---------------------------------------------------

The :fixture:`capsys`, :fixture:`capteesys`, :fixture:`capsysbinary`, :fixture:`capfd`, and :fixture:`capfdbinary`
fixtures allow access to ``stdout``/``stderr`` output created during test execution.

Here is an example test function that performs some output related checks:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_myoutput(capsys):  # or use "capfd" for fd-level
        print("hello")
        sys.stderr.write("world\n")
        captured = capsys.readouterr()
        assert captured.out == "hello\n"
        assert captured.err == "world\n"
        print("next")
        captured = capsys.readouterr()
        assert captured.out == "next\n"

The ``readouterr()`` call snapshots the output so far -
and capturing will be continued.  After the test
function finishes the original streams will
be restored.  Using :fixture:`capsys` this way frees your
test from having to care about setting/resetting
output streams and also interacts well with pytest's
own per-test capturing.

The return value of ``readouterr()`` is a ``namedtuple`` with two attributes, ``out`` and ``err``.

If the code under test writes non-textual data (``bytes``), you can capture this using
the :fixture:`capsysbinary` fixture which instead returns ``bytes`` from
the ``readouterr`` method.

If you want to capture at the file descriptor level you can use
the :fixture:`capfd` fixture which offers the exact
same interface but allows to also capture output from
libraries or subprocesses that directly write to operating
system level output streams (FD1 and FD2). Similarly to :fixture:`capsysbinary`, :fixture:`capfdbinary` can be
used to capture ``bytes`` at the file descriptor level.


To temporarily disable capture within a test, the capture fixtures
have a ``disabled()`` method that can be used
as a context manager, disabling capture inside the ``with`` block:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_disabling_capturing(capsys):
        print("this output is captured")
        with capsys.disabled():
            print("output not captured, going directly to sys.stdout")
        print("this output is also captured")
````

## File: doc/en/how-to/capture-warnings.rst
````
.. _`warnings`:

How to capture warnings
=======================



Starting from version ``3.1``, pytest now automatically catches warnings during test execution
and displays them at the end of the session:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_show_warnings.py
    import warnings


    def api_v1():
        warnings.warn(UserWarning("api v1, should use functions from v2"))
        return 1


    def test_one():
        assert api_v1() == 1

Running pytest now produces this output:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest test_show_warnings.py
    =========================== test session starts ============================

    ======================= 1 passed, 1 warning in 0.12s =======================

.. _`controlling-warnings`:

Controlling warnings
--------------------

Similar to Python's `warning filter`_ and :option:`-W option <python:-W>` flag, pytest provides
its own ``-W`` flag to control which warnings are ignored, displayed, or turned into
errors. See the `warning filter`_ documentation for more
advanced use-cases.

.. _`warning filter`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#warning-filter

This code sample shows how to treat any ``UserWarning`` category class of warning
as an error:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q test_show_warnings.py -W error::UserWarning
    F                                                                    [100%]

        def api_v1():

    E       UserWarning: api v1, should use functions from v2

    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_show_warnings.py::test_one - UserWarning: api v1, should use ...
    1 failed in 0.12s

The same option can be set in the ``pytest.ini`` or ``pyproject.toml`` file using the
``filterwarnings`` ini option. For example, the configuration below will ignore all
user warnings and specific deprecation warnings matching a regex, but will transform
all other warnings into errors.

.. code-block:: ini

    # pytest.ini
    [pytest]
    filterwarnings =
        error
        ignore::UserWarning
        ignore:function ham\(\) is deprecated:DeprecationWarning

.. code-block:: toml

    # pyproject.toml
    [tool.pytest.ini_options]
    filterwarnings = [
        "error",
        "ignore::UserWarning",
        # note the use of single quote below to denote "raw" strings in TOML
        'ignore:function ham\(\) is deprecated:DeprecationWarning',
    ]


When a warning matches more than one option in the list, the action for the last matching option
is performed.


.. note::

    The ``-W`` flag and the ``filterwarnings`` ini option use warning filters that are
    similar in structure, but each configuration option interprets its filter
    differently. For example, *message* in ``filterwarnings`` is a string containing a
    regular expression that the start of the warning message must match,
    case-insensitively, while *message* in ``-W`` is a literal string that the start of
    the warning message must contain (case-insensitively), ignoring any whitespace at
    the start or end of message. Consult the `warning filter`_ documentation for more
    details.


.. _`filterwarnings`:

``@pytest.mark.filterwarnings``
-------------------------------



You can use the :ref:`@pytest.mark.filterwarnings <pytest.mark.filterwarnings ref>` mark to add warning filters to specific test items,
allowing you to have finer control of which warnings should be captured at test, class or
even module level:

.. code-block:: python

    import warnings


    def api_v1():
        warnings.warn(UserWarning("api v1, should use functions from v2"))
        return 1


    @pytest.mark.filterwarnings("ignore:api v1")
    def test_one():
        assert api_v1() == 1


You can specify multiple filters with separate decorators:

.. code-block:: python

    # Ignore "api v1" warnings, but fail on all other warnings
    @pytest.mark.filterwarnings("ignore:api v1")
    @pytest.mark.filterwarnings("error")
    def test_one():
        assert api_v1() == 1

.. important::

    Regarding decorator order and filter precedence:
    it's important to remember that decorators are evaluated in reverse order,
    so you have to list the warning filters in the reverse order
    compared to traditional :py:func:`warnings.filterwarnings` and :option:`-W option <python:-W>` usage.
    This means in practice that filters from earlier :ref:`@pytest.mark.filterwarnings <pytest.mark.filterwarnings ref>` decorators
    take precedence over filters from later decorators, as illustrated in the example above.


Filters applied using a mark take precedence over filters passed on the command line or configured
by the :confval:`filterwarnings` ini option.

You may apply a filter to all tests of a class by using the :ref:`filterwarnings <pytest.mark.filterwarnings ref>` mark as a class
decorator or to all tests in a module by setting the :globalvar:`pytestmark` variable:

.. code-block:: python

    # turns all warnings into errors for this module
    pytestmark = pytest.mark.filterwarnings("error")


.. note::

    If you want to apply multiple filters
    (by assigning a list of :ref:`filterwarnings <pytest.mark.filterwarnings ref>` mark to :globalvar:`pytestmark`),
    you must use the traditional :py:func:`warnings.filterwarnings` ordering approach (later filters take precedence),
    which is the reverse of the decorator approach mentioned above.

Disabling warnings summary
--------------------------

Although not recommended, you can use the ``--disable-warnings`` command-line option to suppress the
warning summary entirely from the test run output.

Disabling warning capture entirely
----------------------------------

This plugin is enabled by default but can be disabled entirely in your ``pytest.ini`` file with:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        addopts = -p no:warnings

Or passing ``-p no:warnings`` in the command-line. This might be useful if your test suites handles warnings
using an external system.


.. _`deprecation-warnings`:

DeprecationWarning and PendingDeprecationWarning
------------------------------------------------

By default pytest will display ``DeprecationWarning`` and ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` warnings from
user code and third-party libraries, as recommended by :pep:`565`.
This helps users keep their code modern and avoid breakages when deprecated warnings are effectively removed.

However, in the specific case where users capture any type of warnings in their test, either with
:func:`pytest.warns`, :func:`pytest.deprecated_call` or using the :fixture:`recwarn` fixture,
no warning will be displayed at all.

Sometimes it is useful to hide some specific deprecation warnings that happen in code that you have no control over
(such as third-party libraries), in which case you might use the warning filters options (ini or marks) to ignore
those warnings.

For example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    filterwarnings =
        ignore:.*U.*mode is deprecated:DeprecationWarning


This will ignore all warnings of type ``DeprecationWarning`` where the start of the message matches
the regular expression ``".*U.*mode is deprecated"``.

See :ref:`@pytest.mark.filterwarnings <filterwarnings>` and
:ref:`Controlling warnings <controlling-warnings>` for more examples.

.. note::

    If warnings are configured at the interpreter level, using
    the :envvar:`python:PYTHONWARNINGS` environment variable or the
    ``-W`` command-line option, pytest will not configure any filters by default.

    Also pytest doesn't follow :pep:`565` suggestion of resetting all warning filters because
    it might break test suites that configure warning filters themselves
    by calling :func:`warnings.simplefilter` (see :issue:`2430` for an example of that).


.. _`ensuring a function triggers a deprecation warning`:

.. _ensuring_function_triggers:

Ensuring code triggers a deprecation warning
--------------------------------------------

You can also use :func:`pytest.deprecated_call` for checking
that a certain function call triggers a ``DeprecationWarning`` or
``PendingDeprecationWarning``:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    def test_myfunction_deprecated():
        with pytest.deprecated_call():
            myfunction(17)

This test will fail if ``myfunction`` does not issue a deprecation warning
when called with a ``17`` argument.




.. _`asserting warnings`:

.. _assertwarnings:

.. _`asserting warnings with the warns function`:

.. _warns:

Asserting warnings with the warns function
------------------------------------------

You can check that code raises a particular warning using :func:`pytest.warns`,
which works in a similar manner to :ref:`raises <assertraises>` (except that
:ref:`raises <assertraises>` does not capture all exceptions, only the
``expected_exception``):

.. code-block:: python

    import warnings

    import pytest


    def test_warning():
        with pytest.warns(UserWarning):
            warnings.warn("my warning", UserWarning)

The test will fail if the warning in question is not raised. Use the keyword
argument ``match`` to assert that the warning matches a text or regex.
To match a literal string that may contain regular expression metacharacters like ``(`` or ``.``, the pattern can
first be escaped with ``re.escape``.

Some examples:

.. code-block:: pycon


    >>> with warns(UserWarning, match="must be 0 or None"):
    ...     warnings.warn("value must be 0 or None", UserWarning)
    ...

    >>> with warns(UserWarning, match=r"must be \d+$"):
    ...     warnings.warn("value must be 42", UserWarning)
    ...

    >>> with warns(UserWarning, match=r"must be \d+$"):
    ...     warnings.warn("this is not here", UserWarning)
    ...
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    Failed: DID NOT WARN. No warnings of type ...UserWarning... were emitted...

    >>> with warns(UserWarning, match=re.escape("issue with foo() func")):
    ...     warnings.warn("issue with foo() func")
    ...

You can also call :func:`pytest.warns` on a function or code string:

.. code-block:: python

    pytest.warns(expected_warning, func, *args, **kwargs)
    pytest.warns(expected_warning, "func(*args, **kwargs)")

The function also returns a list of all raised warnings (as
``warnings.WarningMessage`` objects), which you can query for
additional information:

.. code-block:: python

    with pytest.warns(RuntimeWarning) as record:
        warnings.warn("another warning", RuntimeWarning)

    # check that only one warning was raised
    assert len(record) == 1
    # check that the message matches
    assert record[0].message.args[0] == "another warning"

Alternatively, you can examine raised warnings in detail using the
:fixture:`recwarn` fixture (see :ref:`below <recwarn>`).


The :fixture:`recwarn` fixture automatically ensures to reset the warnings
filter at the end of the test, so no global state is leaked.

.. _`recording warnings`:

.. _recwarn:

Recording warnings
------------------

You can record raised warnings either using the :func:`pytest.warns` context manager or with
the :fixture:`recwarn` fixture.

To record with :func:`pytest.warns` without asserting anything about the warnings,
pass no arguments as the expected warning type and it will default to a generic Warning:

.. code-block:: python

    with pytest.warns() as record:
        warnings.warn("user", UserWarning)
        warnings.warn("runtime", RuntimeWarning)

    assert len(record) == 2
    assert str(record[0].message) == "user"
    assert str(record[1].message) == "runtime"

The :fixture:`recwarn` fixture will record warnings for the whole function:

.. code-block:: python

    import warnings


    def test_hello(recwarn):
        warnings.warn("hello", UserWarning)
        assert len(recwarn) == 1
        w = recwarn.pop(UserWarning)
        assert issubclass(w.category, UserWarning)
        assert str(w.message) == "hello"
        assert w.filename
        assert w.lineno

Both the :fixture:`recwarn` fixture and the :func:`pytest.warns` context manager return the same interface for recorded
warnings: a :class:`~_pytest.recwarn.WarningsRecorder` instance. To view the recorded warnings, you can
iterate over this instance, call ``len`` on it to get the number of recorded
warnings, or index into it to get a particular recorded warning.


.. _`warns use cases`:

Additional use cases of warnings in tests
-----------------------------------------

Here are some use cases involving warnings that often come up in tests, and suggestions on how to deal with them:

- To ensure that **at least one** of the indicated warnings is issued, use:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_warning():
        with pytest.warns((RuntimeWarning, UserWarning)):
            ...

- To ensure that **only** certain warnings are issued, use:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_warning(recwarn):
        ...
        assert len(recwarn) == 1
        user_warning = recwarn.pop(UserWarning)
        assert issubclass(user_warning.category, UserWarning)

-  To ensure that **no** warnings are emitted, use:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_warning():
        with warnings.catch_warnings():
            warnings.simplefilter("error")
            ...

- To suppress warnings, use:

.. code-block:: python

    with warnings.catch_warnings():
        warnings.simplefilter("ignore")
        ...


.. _custom_failure_messages:

Custom failure messages
-----------------------

Recording warnings provides an opportunity to produce custom test
failure messages for when no warnings are issued or other conditions
are met.

.. code-block:: python

    def test():
        with pytest.warns(Warning) as record:
            f()
            if not record:
                pytest.fail("Expected a warning!")

If no warnings are issued when calling ``f``, then ``not record`` will
evaluate to ``True``.  You can then call :func:`pytest.fail` with a
custom error message.

.. _internal-warnings:

Internal pytest warnings
------------------------

pytest may generate its own warnings in some situations, such as improper usage or deprecated features.

For example, pytest will emit a warning if it encounters a class that matches :confval:`python_classes` but also
defines an ``__init__`` constructor, as this prevents the class from being instantiated:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_pytest_warnings.py
    class Test:
        def __init__(self):
            pass

        def test_foo(self):
            assert 1 == 1

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest test_pytest_warnings.py -q

    ============================= warnings summary =============================
    test_pytest_warnings.py:1
      /home/sweet/project/test_pytest_warnings.py:1: PytestCollectionWarning: cannot collect test class 'Test' because it has a __init__ constructor (from: test_pytest_warnings.py)
        class Test:

    -- Docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/capture-warnings.html
    1 warning in 0.12s

These warnings might be filtered using the same builtin mechanisms used to filter other types of warnings.

Please read our :ref:`backwards-compatibility` to learn how we proceed about deprecating and eventually removing
features.

The full list of warnings is listed in :ref:`the reference documentation <warnings ref>`.


.. _`resource-warnings`:

Resource Warnings
-----------------

Additional information of the source of a :class:`ResourceWarning` can be obtained when captured by pytest if
:mod:`tracemalloc` module is enabled.

One convenient way to enable :mod:`tracemalloc` when running tests is to set the :envvar:`PYTHONTRACEMALLOC` to a large
enough number of frames (say ``20``, but that number is application dependent).

For more information, consult the `Python Development Mode <https://docs.python.org/3/library/devmode.html>`__
section in the Python documentation.
````

## File: doc/en/how-to/doctest.rst
````
.. _doctest:

How to run doctests
=========================================================

By default, all files matching the ``test*.txt`` pattern will
be run through the python standard :mod:`doctest` module.  You
can change the pattern by issuing:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --doctest-glob="*.rst"

on the command line. ``--doctest-glob`` can be given multiple times in the command-line.

If you then have a text file like this:

.. code-block:: text

    # content of test_example.txt

    hello this is a doctest
    >>> x = 3
    >>> x
    3

then you can just invoke ``pytest`` directly:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 1 item

    test_example.txt .                                                   [100%]

    ============================ 1 passed in 0.12s =============================

By default, pytest will collect ``test*.txt`` files looking for doctest directives, but you
can pass additional globs using the ``--doctest-glob`` option (multi-allowed).

In addition to text files, you can also execute doctests directly from docstrings of your classes
and functions, including from test modules:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of mymodule.py
    def something():
        """a doctest in a docstring
        >>> something()
        42
        """
        return 42

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pytest --doctest-modules
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 2 items

    mymodule.py .                                                        [ 50%]
    test_example.txt .                                                   [100%]

    ============================ 2 passed in 0.12s =============================

You can make these changes permanent in your project by
putting them into a pytest.ini file like this:

.. code-block:: ini

    # content of pytest.ini
    [pytest]
    addopts = --doctest-modules


Encoding
--------

The default encoding is **UTF-8**, but you can specify the encoding
that will be used for those doctest files using the
``doctest_encoding`` ini option:

.. code-block:: ini

    # content of pytest.ini
    [pytest]
    doctest_encoding = latin1

.. _using doctest options:

Using 'doctest' options
-----------------------

Python's standard :mod:`doctest` module provides some :ref:`options <python:option-flags-and-directives>`
to configure the strictness of doctest tests. In pytest, you can enable those flags using the
configuration file.

For example, to make pytest ignore trailing whitespaces and ignore
lengthy exception stack traces you can just write:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    doctest_optionflags = NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL

Alternatively, options can be enabled by an inline comment in the doc test
itself:

.. code-block:: rst

    >>> something_that_raises()  # doctest: +IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ValueError: ...

pytest also introduces new options:

* ``ALLOW_UNICODE``: when enabled, the ``u`` prefix is stripped from unicode
  strings in expected doctest output. This allows doctests to run in Python 2
  and Python 3 unchanged.

* ``ALLOW_BYTES``: similarly, the ``b`` prefix is stripped from byte strings
  in expected doctest output.

* ``NUMBER``: when enabled, floating-point numbers only need to match as far as
  the precision you have written in the expected doctest output. The numbers are
  compared using :func:`pytest.approx` with relative tolerance equal to the
  precision. For example, the following output would only need to match to 2
  decimal places when comparing ``3.14`` to
  ``pytest.approx(math.pi, rel=10**-2)``::

      >>> math.pi
      3.14

  If you wrote ``3.1416`` then the actual output would need to match to
  approximately 4 decimal places; and so on.

  This avoids false positives caused by limited floating-point precision, like
  this::

      Expected:
          0.233
      Got:
          0.23300000000000001

  ``NUMBER`` also supports lists of floating-point numbers -- in fact, it
  matches floating-point numbers appearing anywhere in the output, even inside
  a string! This means that it may not be appropriate to enable globally in
  ``doctest_optionflags`` in your configuration file.

  .. versionadded:: 5.1


Continue on failure
-------------------

By default, pytest would report only the first failure for a given doctest. If
you want to continue the test even when you have failures, do:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --doctest-modules --doctest-continue-on-failure


Output format
-------------

You can change the diff output format on failure for your doctests
by using one of standard doctest modules format in options
(see :data:`python:doctest.REPORT_UDIFF`, :data:`python:doctest.REPORT_CDIFF`,
:data:`python:doctest.REPORT_NDIFF`, :data:`python:doctest.REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE`):

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --doctest-modules --doctest-report none
    pytest --doctest-modules --doctest-report udiff
    pytest --doctest-modules --doctest-report cdiff
    pytest --doctest-modules --doctest-report ndiff
    pytest --doctest-modules --doctest-report only_first_failure


pytest-specific features
------------------------

Some features are provided to make writing doctests easier or with better integration with
your existing test suite. Keep in mind however that by using those features you will make
your doctests incompatible with the standard ``doctests`` module.

Using fixtures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to use fixtures using the ``getfixture`` helper:

.. code-block:: text

    # content of example.rst
    >>> tmp = getfixture('tmp_path')
    >>> ...
    >>>

Note that the fixture needs to be defined in a place visible by pytest, for example, a `conftest.py`
file or plugin; normal python files containing docstrings are not normally scanned for fixtures
unless explicitly configured by :confval:`python_files`.

Also, the :ref:`usefixtures <usefixtures>` mark and fixtures marked as :ref:`autouse <autouse>` are supported
when executing text doctest files.


.. _`doctest_namespace`:

'doctest_namespace' fixture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``doctest_namespace`` fixture can be used to inject items into the
namespace in which your doctests run. It is intended to be used within
your own fixtures to provide the tests that use them with context.

``doctest_namespace`` is a standard ``dict`` object into which you
place the objects you want to appear in the doctest namespace:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py
    import pytest
    import numpy


    @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
    def add_np(doctest_namespace):
        doctest_namespace["np"] = numpy

which can then be used in your doctests directly:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of numpy.py
    def arange():
        """
        >>> a = np.arange(10)
        >>> len(a)
        10
        """

Note that like the normal ``conftest.py``, the fixtures are discovered in the directory tree conftest is in.
Meaning that if you put your doctest with your source code, the relevant conftest.py needs to be in the same directory tree.
Fixtures will not be discovered in a sibling directory tree!

Skipping tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the same reasons one might want to skip normal tests, it is also possible to skip
tests inside doctests.

To skip a single check inside a doctest you can use the standard
:data:`doctest.SKIP` directive:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_random(y):
        """
        >>> random.random()  # doctest: +SKIP
        0.156231223

        >>> 1 + 1
        2
        """

This will skip the first check, but not the second.

pytest also allows using the standard pytest functions :func:`pytest.skip` and
:func:`pytest.xfail` inside doctests, which might be useful because you can
then skip/xfail tests based on external conditions:


.. code-block:: text

    >>> import sys, pytest
    >>> if sys.platform.startswith('win'):
    ...     pytest.skip('this doctest does not work on Windows')
    ...
    >>> import fcntl
    >>> ...

However using those functions is discouraged because it reduces the readability of the
docstring.

.. note::

    :func:`pytest.skip` and :func:`pytest.xfail` behave differently depending
    if the doctests are in a Python file (in docstrings) or a text file containing
    doctests intermingled with text:

    * Python modules (docstrings): the functions only act in that specific docstring,
      letting the other docstrings in the same module execute as normal.

    * Text files: the functions will skip/xfail the checks for the rest of the entire
      file.


Alternatives
------------

While the built-in pytest support provides a good set of functionalities for using
doctests, if you use them extensively you might be interested in those external packages
which add many more features, and include pytest integration:

* `pytest-doctestplus <https://github.com/scientific-python/pytest-doctestplus>`__: provides
  advanced doctest support and enables the testing of reStructuredText (".rst") files.

* `Sybil <https://sybil.readthedocs.io>`__: provides a way to test examples in
  your documentation by parsing them from the documentation source and evaluating
  the parsed examples as part of your normal test run.

.. _existingtestsuite:

How to use pytest with an existing test suite
==============================================

Pytest can be used with most existing test suites, but its
behavior differs from other test runners such as Python's
default unittest framework.

Before using this section you will want to :ref:`install pytest <getstarted>`.

Running an existing test suite with pytest
---------------------------------------------

Say you want to contribute to an existing repository somewhere.
After pulling the code into your development space using some
flavor of version control and (optionally) setting up a virtualenv
you will want to run:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd <repository>
    pip install -e .  # Environment dependent alternatives include
                      # 'python setup.py develop' and 'conda develop'

in your project root.  This will set up a symlink to your code in
site-packages, allowing you to edit your code while your tests
run against it as if it were installed.

Setting up your project in development mode lets you avoid having to
reinstall every time you want to run your tests, and is less brittle than
mucking about with sys.path to point your tests at local code.

Also consider using :ref:`tox <use tox>`.
````

## File: doc/en/how-to/failures.rst
````
.. _how-to-handle-failures:

How to handle test failures
=============================

.. _maxfail:

Stopping after the first (or N) failures
---------------------------------------------------

To stop the testing process after the first (N) failures:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -x           # stop after first failure
    pytest --maxfail=2  # stop after two failures


.. _pdb-option:

Using :doc:`python:library/pdb` with pytest
-------------------------------------------

Dropping to :doc:`pdb <python:library/pdb>` on failures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python comes with a builtin Python debugger called :doc:`pdb <python:library/pdb>`.  ``pytest``
allows one to drop into the :doc:`pdb <python:library/pdb>` prompt via a command line option:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --pdb

This will invoke the Python debugger on every failure (or KeyboardInterrupt).
Often you might only want to do this for the first failing test to understand
a certain failure situation:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -x --pdb   # drop to PDB on first failure, then end test session
    pytest --pdb --maxfail=3  # drop to PDB for first three failures

Note that on any failure the exception information is stored on
``sys.last_value``, ``sys.last_type`` and ``sys.last_traceback``. In
interactive use, this allows one to drop into postmortem debugging with
any debug tool. One can also manually access the exception information,
for example::

    >>> import sys
    >>> sys.last_traceback.tb_lineno
    42
    >>> sys.last_value
    AssertionError('assert result == "ok"',)


.. _trace-option:

Dropping to :doc:`pdb <python:library/pdb>` at the start of a test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``pytest`` allows one to drop into the :doc:`pdb <python:library/pdb>` prompt immediately at the start of each test via a command line option:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --trace

This will invoke the Python debugger at the start of every test.

.. _breakpoints:

Setting breakpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded: 2.4.0

To set a breakpoint in your code use the native Python ``import pdb;pdb.set_trace()`` call
in your code and pytest automatically disables its output capture for that test:

* Output capture in other tests is not affected.
* Any prior test output that has already been captured and will be processed as
  such.
* Output capture gets resumed when ending the debugger session (via the
  ``continue`` command).


.. _`breakpoint-builtin`:

Using the builtin breakpoint function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python 3.7 introduces a builtin ``breakpoint()`` function.
Pytest supports the use of ``breakpoint()`` with the following behaviours:

 - When ``breakpoint()`` is called and ``PYTHONBREAKPOINT`` is set to the default value, pytest will use the custom internal PDB trace UI instead of the system default ``Pdb``.
 - When tests are complete, the system will default back to the system ``Pdb`` trace UI.
 - With ``--pdb`` passed to pytest, the custom internal Pdb trace UI is used with both ``breakpoint()`` and failed tests/unhandled exceptions.
 - ``--pdbcls`` can be used to specify a custom debugger class.


.. _faulthandler:

Fault Handler
-------------

.. versionadded:: 5.0

The :mod:`faulthandler` standard module
can be used to dump Python tracebacks on a segfault or after a timeout.

The module is automatically enabled for pytest runs, unless the ``-p no:faulthandler`` is given
on the command-line.

Also the :confval:`faulthandler_timeout=X<faulthandler_timeout>` configuration option can be used
to dump the traceback of all threads if a test takes longer than ``X``
seconds to finish.

.. note::

    This functionality has been integrated from the external
    `pytest-faulthandler <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler>`__ plugin, with two
    small differences:

    * To disable it, use ``-p no:faulthandler`` instead of ``--no-faulthandler``: the former
      can be used with any plugin, so it saves one option.

    * The ``--faulthandler-timeout`` command-line option has become the
      :confval:`faulthandler_timeout` configuration option. It can still be configured from
      the command-line using ``-o faulthandler_timeout=X``.


.. _unraisable:

Warning about unraisable exceptions and unhandled thread exceptions
-------------------------------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 6.2

Unhandled exceptions are exceptions that are raised in a situation in which
they cannot propagate to a caller. The most common case is an exception raised
in a :meth:`__del__ <object.__del__>` implementation.

Unhandled thread exceptions are exceptions raised in a :class:`~threading.Thread`
but not handled, causing the thread to terminate uncleanly.

Both types of exceptions are normally considered bugs, but may go unnoticed
because they don't cause the program itself to crash. Pytest detects these
conditions and issues a warning that is visible in the test run summary.

The plugins are automatically enabled for pytest runs, unless the
``-p no:unraisableexception`` (for unraisable exceptions) and
``-p no:threadexception`` (for thread exceptions) options are given on the
command-line.

The warnings may be silenced selectively using the :ref:`pytest.mark.filterwarnings ref`
mark. The warning categories are :class:`pytest.PytestUnraisableExceptionWarning` and
:class:`pytest.PytestUnhandledThreadExceptionWarning`.

How to use fixtures
====================

.. seealso:: :ref:`about-fixtures`
.. seealso:: :ref:`Fixtures reference <reference-fixtures>`


"Requesting" fixtures
---------------------

At a basic level, test functions request fixtures they require by declaring
them as arguments.

When pytest goes to run a test, it looks at the parameters in that test
function's signature, and then searches for fixtures that have the same names as
those parameters. Once pytest finds them, it runs those fixtures, captures what
they returned (if anything), and passes those objects into the test function as
arguments.


Quick example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    class Fruit:
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name
            self.cubed = False

        def cube(self):
            self.cubed = True


    class FruitSalad:
        def __init__(self, *fruit_bowl):
            self.fruit = fruit_bowl
            self._cube_fruit()

        def _cube_fruit(self):
            for fruit in self.fruit:
                fruit.cube()


    # Arrange
    @pytest.fixture
    def fruit_bowl():
        return [Fruit("apple"), Fruit("banana")]


    def test_fruit_salad(fruit_bowl):
        # Act
        fruit_salad = FruitSalad(*fruit_bowl)

        # Assert
        assert all(fruit.cubed for fruit in fruit_salad.fruit)

In this example, ``test_fruit_salad`` "**requests**" ``fruit_bowl`` (i.e.
``def test_fruit_salad(fruit_bowl):``), and when pytest sees this, it will
execute the ``fruit_bowl`` fixture function and pass the object it returns into
``test_fruit_salad`` as the ``fruit_bowl`` argument.

Here's roughly
what's happening if we were to do it by hand:

.. code-block:: python

    def fruit_bowl():
        return [Fruit("apple"), Fruit("banana")]


    def test_fruit_salad(fruit_bowl):
        # Act
        fruit_salad = FruitSalad(*fruit_bowl)

        # Assert
        assert all(fruit.cubed for fruit in fruit_salad.fruit)


    # Arrange
    bowl = fruit_bowl()
    test_fruit_salad(fruit_bowl=bowl)


Fixtures can **request** other fixtures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of pytest's greatest strengths is its extremely flexible fixture system. It
allows us to boil down complex requirements for tests into more simple and
organized functions, where we only need to have each one describe the things
they are dependent on. We'll get more into this further down, but for now,
here's a quick example to demonstrate how fixtures can use other fixtures:

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of test_append.py
    import pytest


    # Arrange
    @pytest.fixture
    def first_entry():
        return "a"


    # Arrange
    @pytest.fixture
    def order(first_entry):
        return [first_entry]


    def test_string(order):
        # Act
        order.append("b")

        # Assert
        assert order == ["a", "b"]


Notice that this is the same example from above, but very little changed. The
fixtures in pytest **request** fixtures just like tests. All the same
**requesting** rules apply to fixtures that do for tests. Here's how this
example would work if we did it by hand:

.. code-block:: python

    def first_entry():
        return "a"


    def order(first_entry):
        return [first_entry]


    def test_string(order):
        # Act
        order.append("b")

        # Assert
        assert order == ["a", "b"]


    entry = first_entry()
    the_list = order(first_entry=entry)
    test_string(order=the_list)

Fixtures are reusable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the things that makes pytest's fixture system so powerful, is that it
gives us the ability to define a generic setup step that can be reused over and
over, just like a normal function would be used. Two different tests can request
the same fixture and have pytest give each test their own result from that
fixture.

This is extremely useful for making sure tests aren't affected by each other. We
can use this system to make sure each test gets its own fresh batch of data and
is starting from a clean state so it can provide consistent, repeatable results.

Here's an example of how this can come in handy:

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of test_append.py
    import pytest


    # Arrange
    @pytest.fixture
    def first_entry():
        return "a"


    # Arrange
    @pytest.fixture
    def order(first_entry):
        return [first_entry]


    def test_string(order):
        # Act
        order.append("b")

        # Assert
        assert order == ["a", "b"]


    def test_int(order):
        # Act
        order.append(2)

        # Assert
        assert order == ["a", 2]


Each test here is being given its own copy of that ``list`` object,
which means the ``order`` fixture is getting executed twice (the same
is true for the ``first_entry`` fixture). If we were to do this by hand as
well, it would look something like this:

.. code-block:: python

    def first_entry():
        return "a"


    def order(first_entry):
        return [first_entry]


    def test_string(order):
        # Act
        order.append("b")

        # Assert
        assert order == ["a", "b"]


    def test_int(order):
        # Act
        order.append(2)

        # Assert
        assert order == ["a", 2]


    entry = first_entry()
    the_list = order(first_entry=entry)
    test_string(order=the_list)

    entry = first_entry()
    the_list = order(first_entry=entry)
    test_int(order=the_list)

A test/fixture can **request** more than one fixture at a time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tests and fixtures aren't limited to **requesting** a single fixture at a time.
They can request as many as they like. Here's another quick example to
demonstrate:

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of test_append.py
    import pytest


    # Arrange
    @pytest.fixture
    def first_entry():
        return "a"


    # Arrange
    @pytest.fixture
    def second_entry():
        return 2


    # Arrange
    @pytest.fixture
    def order(first_entry, second_entry):
        return [first_entry, second_entry]


    # Arrange
    @pytest.fixture
    def expected_list():
        return ["a", 2, 3.0]


    def test_string(order, expected_list):
        # Act
        order.append(3.0)

        # Assert
        assert order == expected_list

Fixtures can be **requested** more than once per test (return values are cached)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixtures can also be **requested** more than once during the same test, and
pytest won't execute them again for that test. This means we can **request**
fixtures in multiple fixtures that are dependent on them (and even again in the
test itself) without those fixtures being executed more than once.

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of test_append.py
    import pytest


    # Arrange
    @pytest.fixture
    def first_entry():
        return "a"


    # Arrange
    @pytest.fixture
    def order():
        return []


    # Act
    @pytest.fixture
    def append_first(order, first_entry):
        return order.append(first_entry)


    def test_string_only(append_first, order, first_entry):
        # Assert
        assert order == [first_entry]

If a **requested** fixture was executed once for every time it was **requested**
during a test, then this test would fail because both ``append_first`` and
``test_string_only`` would see ``order`` as an empty list (i.e. ``[]``), but
since the return value of ``order`` was cached (along with any side effects
executing it may have had) after the first time it was called, both the test and
``append_first`` were referencing the same object, and the test saw the effect
``append_first`` had on that object.

.. _`autouse`:
.. _`autouse fixtures`:

Autouse fixtures (fixtures you don't have to request)
-----------------------------------------------------

Sometimes you may want to have a fixture (or even several) that you know all
your tests will depend on. "Autouse" fixtures are a convenient way to make all
tests automatically **request** them. This can cut out a
lot of redundant **requests**, and can even provide more advanced fixture usage
(more on that further down).

We can make a fixture an autouse fixture by passing in ``autouse=True`` to the
fixture's decorator. Here's a simple example for how they can be used:

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of test_append.py
    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture
    def first_entry():
        return "a"


    @pytest.fixture
    def order(first_entry):
        return []


    @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
    def append_first(order, first_entry):
        return order.append(first_entry)


    def test_string_only(order, first_entry):
        assert order == [first_entry]


    def test_string_and_int(order, first_entry):
        order.append(2)
        assert order == [first_entry, 2]

In this example, the ``append_first`` fixture is an autouse fixture. Because it
happens automatically, both tests are affected by it, even though neither test
**requested** it. That doesn't mean they *can't* be **requested** though; just
that it isn't *necessary*.

.. _smtpshared:

Scope: sharing fixtures across classes, modules, packages or session
--------------------------------------------------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

Fixtures requiring network access depend on connectivity and are
usually time-expensive to create.  Extending the previous example, we
can add a ``scope="module"`` parameter to the
:py:func:`@pytest.fixture <pytest.fixture>` invocation
to cause a ``smtp_connection`` fixture function, responsible to create a connection to a preexisting SMTP server, to only be invoked
once per test *module* (the default is to invoke once per test *function*).
Multiple test functions in a test module will thus
each receive the same ``smtp_connection`` fixture instance, thus saving time.
Possible values for ``scope`` are: ``function``, ``class``, ``module``, ``package`` or ``session``.

The next example puts the fixture function into a separate ``conftest.py`` file
so that tests from multiple test modules in the directory can
access the fixture function:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py
    import smtplib

    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture(scope="module")
    def smtp_connection():
        return smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com", 587, timeout=5)


.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_module.py


    def test_ehlo(smtp_connection):
        response, msg = smtp_connection.ehlo()
        assert response == 250
        assert b"smtp.gmail.com" in msg
        assert 0  # for demo purposes


    def test_noop(smtp_connection):
        response, msg = smtp_connection.noop()
        assert response == 250
        assert 0  # for demo purposes

Here, the ``test_ehlo`` needs the ``smtp_connection`` fixture value.  pytest
will discover and call the :py:func:`@pytest.fixture <pytest.fixture>`
marked ``smtp_connection`` fixture function.  Running the test looks like this:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest test_module.py
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y

    test_module.py FF                                                    [100%]

        def test_ehlo(smtp_connection):
            response, msg = smtp_connection.ehlo()
            assert response == 250
            assert b"smtp.gmail.com" in msg
    >       assert 0  # for demo purposes
            ^^^^^^^^
    E       assert 0

    test_module.py:7: AssertionError
    ________________________________ test_noop _________________________________

    smtp_connection = <smtplib.SMTP object at 0xdeadbeef0001>

        def test_noop(smtp_connection):
            response, msg = smtp_connection.noop()
            assert response == 250
    >       assert 0  # for demo purposes
            ^^^^^^^^
    E       assert 0

    test_module.py:13: AssertionError

    FAILED test_module.py::test_ehlo - assert 0
    FAILED test_module.py::test_noop - assert 0
    ============================ 2 failed in 0.12s =============================

You see the two ``assert 0`` failing and more importantly you can also see
that the **exactly same** ``smtp_connection`` object was passed into the
two test functions because pytest shows the incoming argument values in the
traceback.  As a result, the two test functions using ``smtp_connection`` run
as quick as a single one because they reuse the same instance.

If you decide that you rather want to have a session-scoped ``smtp_connection``
instance, you can simply declare it:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
    def smtp_connection():
        # the returned fixture value will be shared for
        # all tests requesting it
        ...


Fixture scopes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixtures are created when first requested by a test, and are destroyed based on their ``scope``:

* ``function``: the default scope, the fixture is destroyed at the end of the test.
* ``class``: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the class.
* ``module``: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the module.
* ``package``: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the package where the fixture is defined, including sub-packages and sub-directories within it.
* ``session``: the fixture is destroyed at the end of the test session.

.. note::

    Pytest only caches one instance of a fixture at a time, which
    means that when using a parametrized fixture, pytest may invoke a fixture more than once in
    the given scope.

.. _dynamic scope:

Dynamic scope
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 5.2

In some cases, you might want to change the scope of the fixture without changing the code.
To do that, pass a callable to ``scope``. The callable must return a string with a valid scope
and will be executed only once - during the fixture definition. It will be called with two
keyword arguments - ``fixture_name`` as a string and ``config`` with a configuration object.

This can be especially useful when dealing with fixtures that need time for setup, like spawning
a docker container. You can use the command-line argument to control the scope of the spawned
containers for different environments. See the example below.

.. code-block:: python

    def determine_scope(fixture_name, config):
        if config.getoption("--keep-containers", None):
            return "session"
        return "function"


    @pytest.fixture(scope=determine_scope)
    def docker_container():
        yield spawn_container()



.. _`finalization`:

Teardown/Cleanup (AKA Fixture finalization)
-------------------------------------------

When we run our tests, we'll want to make sure they clean up after themselves so
they don't mess with any other tests (and also so that we don't leave behind a
mountain of test data to bloat the system). Fixtures in pytest offer a very
useful teardown system, which allows us to define the specific steps necessary
for each fixture to clean up after itself.

This system can be leveraged in two ways.

.. _`yield fixtures`:

1. ``yield`` fixtures (recommended)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. regendoc: wipe

"Yield" fixtures ``yield`` instead of ``return``. With these
fixtures, we can run some code and pass an object back to the requesting
fixture/test, just like with the other fixtures. The only differences are:

1. ``return`` is swapped out for ``yield``.
2. Any teardown code for that fixture is placed *after* the ``yield``.

Once pytest figures out a linear order for the fixtures, it will run each one up
until it returns or yields, and then move on to the next fixture in the list to
do the same thing.

Once the test is finished, pytest will go back down the list of fixtures, but in
the *reverse order*, taking each one that yielded, and running the code inside
it that was *after* the ``yield`` statement.

As a simple example, consider this basic email module:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of emaillib.py
    class MailAdminClient:
        def create_user(self):
            return MailUser()

        def delete_user(self, user):
            # do some cleanup
            pass


    class MailUser:
        def __init__(self):
            self.inbox = []

        def send_email(self, email, other):
            other.inbox.append(email)

        def clear_mailbox(self):
            self.inbox.clear()


    class Email:
        def __init__(self, subject, body):
            self.subject = subject
            self.body = body

Let's say we want to test sending email from one user to another. We'll have to
first make each user, then send the email from one user to the other, and
finally assert that the other user received that message in their inbox. If we
want to clean up after the test runs, we'll likely have to make sure the other
user's mailbox is emptied before deleting that user, otherwise the system may
complain.

Here's what that might look like:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_emaillib.py
    from emaillib import Email, MailAdminClient

    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture
    def mail_admin():
        return MailAdminClient()


    @pytest.fixture
    def sending_user(mail_admin):
        user = mail_admin.create_user()
        yield user
        mail_admin.delete_user(user)


    @pytest.fixture
    def receiving_user(mail_admin):
        user = mail_admin.create_user()
        yield user
        user.clear_mailbox()
        mail_admin.delete_user(user)


    def test_email_received(sending_user, receiving_user):
        email = Email(subject="Hey!", body="How's it going?")
        sending_user.send_email(email, receiving_user)
        assert email in receiving_user.inbox

Because ``receiving_user`` is the last fixture to run during setup, it's the first to run
during teardown.

There is a risk that even having the order right on the teardown side of things
doesn't guarantee a safe cleanup. That's covered in a bit more detail in
:ref:`safe teardowns`.

   .                                                                    [100%]

Handling errors for yield fixture
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If a yield fixture raises an exception before yielding, pytest won't try to run
the teardown code after that yield fixture's ``yield`` statement. But, for every
fixture that has already run successfully for that test, pytest will still
attempt to tear them down as it normally would.

2. Adding finalizers directly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While yield fixtures are considered to be the cleaner and more straightforward
option, there is another choice, and that is to add "finalizer" functions
directly to the test's `request-context`_ object. It brings a similar result as
yield fixtures, but requires a bit more verbosity.

In order to use this approach, we have to request the `request-context`_ object
(just like we would request another fixture) in the fixture we need to add
teardown code for, and then pass a callable, containing that teardown code, to
its ``addfinalizer`` method.

We have to be careful though, because pytest will run that finalizer once it's
been added, even if that fixture raises an exception after adding the finalizer.
So to make sure we don't run the finalizer code when we wouldn't need to, we
would only add the finalizer once the fixture would have done something that
we'd need to teardown.

Here's how the previous example would look using the ``addfinalizer`` method:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_emaillib.py
    from emaillib import Email, MailAdminClient

    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture
    def mail_admin():
        return MailAdminClient()


    @pytest.fixture
    def sending_user(mail_admin):
        user = mail_admin.create_user()
        yield user
        mail_admin.delete_user(user)


    @pytest.fixture
    def receiving_user(mail_admin, request):
        user = mail_admin.create_user()

        def delete_user():
            mail_admin.delete_user(user)

        request.addfinalizer(delete_user)
        return user


    @pytest.fixture
    def email(sending_user, receiving_user, request):
        _email = Email(subject="Hey!", body="How's it going?")
        sending_user.send_email(_email, receiving_user)

        def empty_mailbox():
            receiving_user.clear_mailbox()

        request.addfinalizer(empty_mailbox)
        return _email


    def test_email_received(receiving_user, email):
        assert email in receiving_user.inbox


It's a bit longer than yield fixtures and a bit more complex, but it
does offer some nuances for when you're in a pinch.

Note on finalizer order
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Finalizers are executed in a first-in-last-out order.
For yield fixtures, the first teardown code to run is from the right-most fixture, i.e. the last test parameter.

        print("after_yield_1")

    def test_bar(fix_w_finalizers):
        print("test_bar")

This is so because yield fixtures use `addfinalizer` behind the scenes: when the fixture executes, `addfinalizer` registers a function that resumes the generator, which in turn calls the teardown code.


.. _`safe teardowns`:

Safe teardowns
--------------

The fixture system of pytest is *very* powerful, but it's still being run by a
computer, so it isn't able to figure out how to safely teardown everything we
throw at it. If we aren't careful, an error in the wrong spot might leave stuff
from our tests behind, and that can cause further issues pretty quickly.

For example, consider the following tests (based off of the mail example from
above):

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_emaillib.py
    from emaillib import Email, MailAdminClient

    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture
    def setup():
        mail_admin = MailAdminClient()
        sending_user = mail_admin.create_user()
        receiving_user = mail_admin.create_user()
        email = Email(subject="Hey!", body="How's it going?")
        sending_user.send_email(email, receiving_user)
        yield receiving_user, email
        receiving_user.clear_mailbox()
        mail_admin.delete_user(sending_user)
        mail_admin.delete_user(receiving_user)


    def test_email_received(setup):
        receiving_user, email = setup
        assert email in receiving_user.inbox

This version is a lot more compact, but it's also harder to read, doesn't have a
very descriptive fixture name, and none of the fixtures can be reused easily.

There's also a more serious issue, which is that if any of those steps in the
setup raise an exception, none of the teardown code will run.

One option might be to go with the ``addfinalizer`` method instead of yield
fixtures, but that might get pretty complex and difficult to maintain (and it
wouldn't be compact anymore).

.. code-block:: pytest

   $ pytest -q test_emaillib.py
   .                                                                    [100%]

.. _`safe fixture structure`:

Safe fixture structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The safest and simplest fixture structure requires limiting fixtures to only
making one state-changing action each, and then bundling them together with
their teardown code, as :ref:`the email examples above <yield fixtures>` showed.

The chance that a state-changing operation can fail but still modify state is
negligible, as most of these operations tend to be `transaction
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_processing>`_-based (at least at the
level of testing where state could be left behind). So if we make sure that any
successful state-changing action gets torn down by moving it to a separate
fixture function and separating it from other, potentially failing
state-changing actions, then our tests will stand the best chance at leaving
the test environment the way they found it.

For an example, let's say we have a website with a login page, and we have
access to an admin API where we can generate users. For our test, we want to:

1. Create a user through that admin API
2. Launch a browser using Selenium
3. Go to the login page of our site
4. Log in as the user we created
5. Assert that their name is in the header of the landing page

We wouldn't want to leave that user in the system, nor would we want to leave
that browser session running, so we'll want to make sure the fixtures that
create those things clean up after themselves.

Here's what that might look like:

.. note::

    For this example, certain fixtures (i.e. ``base_url`` and
    ``admin_credentials``) are implied to exist elsewhere. So for now, let's
    assume they exist, and we're just not looking at them.

.. code-block:: python

    from uuid import uuid4
    from urllib.parse import urljoin

    from selenium.webdriver import Chrome
    import pytest

    from src.utils.pages import LoginPage, LandingPage
    from src.utils import AdminApiClient
    from src.utils.data_types import User


    @pytest.fixture
    def admin_client(base_url, admin_credentials):
        return AdminApiClient(base_url, **admin_credentials)


    @pytest.fixture
    def user(admin_client):
        _user = User(name="Susan", username=f"testuser-{uuid4()}", password="P4$$word")
        admin_client.create_user(_user)
        yield _user
        admin_client.delete_user(_user)


    @pytest.fixture
    def driver():
        _driver = Chrome()
        yield _driver
        _driver.quit()


    @pytest.fixture
    def login(driver, base_url, user):
        driver.get(urljoin(base_url, "/login"))
        page = LoginPage(driver)
        page.login(user)


    @pytest.fixture
    def landing_page(driver, login):
        return LandingPage(driver)


    def test_name_on_landing_page_after_login(landing_page, user):
        assert landing_page.header == f"Welcome, {user.name}!"

The way the dependencies are laid out means it's unclear if the ``user``
fixture would execute before the ``driver`` fixture. But that's ok, because
those are atomic operations, and so it doesn't matter which one runs first
because the sequence of events for the test is still `linearizable
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearizability>`_. But what *does* matter is
that, no matter which one runs first, if the one raises an exception while the
other would not have, neither will have left anything behind. If ``driver``
executes before ``user``, and ``user`` raises an exception, the driver will
still quit, and the user was never made. And if ``driver`` was the one to raise
the exception, then the driver would never have been started and the user would
never have been made.

.. note:

    While the ``user`` fixture doesn't *actually* need to happen before the
    ``driver`` fixture, if we made ``driver`` request ``user``, it might save
    some time in the event that making the user raises an exception, since it
    won't bother trying to start the driver, which is a fairly expensive
    operation.


Running multiple ``assert`` statements safely
---------------------------------------------

Sometimes you may want to run multiple asserts after doing all that setup, which
makes sense as, in more complex systems, a single action can kick off multiple
behaviors. pytest has a convenient way of handling this and it combines a bunch
of what we've gone over so far.

All that's needed is stepping up to a larger scope, then having the **act**
step defined as an autouse fixture, and finally, making sure all the fixtures
are targeting that higher level scope.

Let's pull :ref:`an example from above <safe fixture structure>`, and tweak it a
bit. Let's say that in addition to checking for a welcome message in the header,
we also want to check for a sign out button, and a link to the user's profile.

Let's take a look at how we can structure that so we can run multiple asserts
without having to repeat all those steps again.

.. note::

    For this example, certain fixtures (i.e. ``base_url`` and
    ``admin_credentials``) are implied to exist elsewhere. So for now, let's
    assume they exist, and we're just not looking at them.

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of tests/end_to_end/test_login.py
    from uuid import uuid4
    from urllib.parse import urljoin

    from selenium.webdriver import Chrome
    import pytest

    from src.utils.pages import LoginPage, LandingPage
    from src.utils import AdminApiClient
    from src.utils.data_types import User


    @pytest.fixture(scope="class")
    def admin_client(base_url, admin_credentials):
        return AdminApiClient(base_url, **admin_credentials)


    @pytest.fixture(scope="class")
    def user(admin_client):
        _user = User(name="Susan", username=f"testuser-{uuid4()}", password="P4$$word")
        admin_client.create_user(_user)
        yield _user
        admin_client.delete_user(_user)


    @pytest.fixture(scope="class")
    def driver():
        _driver = Chrome()
        yield _driver
        _driver.quit()


    @pytest.fixture(scope="class")
    def landing_page(driver, login):
        return LandingPage(driver)


    class TestLandingPageSuccess:
        @pytest.fixture(scope="class", autouse=True)
        def login(self, driver, base_url, user):
            driver.get(urljoin(base_url, "/login"))
            page = LoginPage(driver)
            page.login(user)

        def test_name_in_header(self, landing_page, user):
            assert landing_page.header == f"Welcome, {user.name}!"

        def test_sign_out_button(self, landing_page):
            assert landing_page.sign_out_button.is_displayed()

        def test_profile_link(self, landing_page, user):
            profile_href = urljoin(base_url, f"/profile?id={user.profile_id}")
            assert landing_page.profile_link.get_attribute("href") == profile_href

Notice that the methods are only referencing ``self`` in the signature as a
formality. No state is tied to the actual test class as it might be in the
``unittest.TestCase`` framework. Everything is managed by the pytest fixture
system.

Each method only has to request the fixtures that it actually needs without
worrying about order. This is because the **act** fixture is an autouse fixture,
and it made sure all the other fixtures executed before it. There's no more
changes of state that need to take place, so the tests are free to make as many
non-state-changing queries as they want without risking stepping on the toes of
the other tests.

The ``login`` fixture is defined inside the class as well, because not every one
of the other tests in the module will be expecting a successful login, and the **act** may need to
be handled a little differently for another test class. For example, if we
wanted to write another test scenario around submitting bad credentials, we
could handle it by adding something like this to the test file:

.. note:

    It's assumed that the page object for this (i.e. ``LoginPage``) raises a
    custom exception, ``BadCredentialsException``, when it recognizes text
    signifying that on the login form after attempting to log in.

.. code-block:: python

    class TestLandingPageBadCredentials:
        @pytest.fixture(scope="class")
        def faux_user(self, user):
            _user = deepcopy(user)
            _user.password = "badpass"
            return _user

        def test_raises_bad_credentials_exception(self, login_page, faux_user):
            with pytest.raises(BadCredentialsException):
                login_page.login(faux_user)


.. _`request-context`:

Fixtures can introspect the requesting test context
-------------------------------------------------------------

Fixture functions can accept the :py:class:`request <_pytest.fixtures.FixtureRequest>` object
to introspect the "requesting" test function, class or module context.
Further extending the previous ``smtp_connection`` fixture example, let's
read an optional server URL from the test module which uses our fixture:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py
    import smtplib

    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture(scope="module")
    def smtp_connection(request):
        server = getattr(request.module, "smtpserver", "smtp.gmail.com")
        smtp_connection = smtplib.SMTP(server, 587, timeout=5)
        yield smtp_connection
        print(f"finalizing {smtp_connection} ({server})")
        smtp_connection.close()

We use the ``request.module`` attribute to optionally obtain an
``smtpserver`` attribute from the test module.  If we just execute
again, nothing much has changed:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -s -q --tb=no test_module.py
    FFfinalizing <smtplib.SMTP object at 0xdeadbeef0002> (smtp.gmail.com)

    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_module.py::test_ehlo - assert 0
    FAILED test_module.py::test_noop - assert 0
    2 failed in 0.12s

Let's quickly create another test module that actually sets the
server URL in its module namespace:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_anothersmtp.py

    smtpserver = "mail.python.org"  # will be read by smtp fixture


    def test_showhelo(smtp_connection):
        assert 0, smtp_connection.helo()

Running it:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -qq --tb=short test_anothersmtp.py
    F                                                                    [100%]
    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    ______________________________ test_showhelo _______________________________
    test_anothersmtp.py:6: in test_showhelo
        assert 0, smtp_connection.helo()

voila! The ``smtp_connection`` fixture function picked up our mail server name
from the module namespace.

.. _`using-markers`:

Using markers to pass data to fixtures
-------------------------------------------------------------

Using the :py:class:`request <_pytest.fixtures.FixtureRequest>` object, a fixture can also access
markers which are applied to a test function. This can be useful to pass data
into a fixture from a test:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture
    def fixt(request):
        marker = request.node.get_closest_marker("fixt_data")
        if marker is None:
            # Handle missing marker in some way...
            data = None
        else:
            data = marker.args[0]

        # Do something with the data
        return data


    @pytest.mark.fixt_data(42)
    def test_fixt(fixt):
        assert fixt == 42

.. _`fixture-factory`:

Factories as fixtures
-------------------------------------------------------------

The "factory as fixture" pattern can help in situations where the result
of a fixture is needed multiple times in a single test. Instead of returning
data directly, the fixture instead returns a function which generates the data.
This function can then be called multiple times in the test.

Factories can have parameters as needed:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture
    def make_customer_record():
        def _make_customer_record(name):
            return {"name": name, "orders": []}

        return _make_customer_record


    def test_customer_records(make_customer_record):
        customer_1 = make_customer_record("Lisa")
        customer_2 = make_customer_record("Mike")
        customer_3 = make_customer_record("Meredith")

If the data created by the factory requires managing, the fixture can take care of that:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture
    def make_customer_record():
        created_records = []

        def _make_customer_record(name):
            record = models.Customer(name=name, orders=[])
            created_records.append(record)
            return record

        yield _make_customer_record

        for record in created_records:
            record.destroy()


    def test_customer_records(make_customer_record):
        customer_1 = make_customer_record("Lisa")
        customer_2 = make_customer_record("Mike")
        customer_3 = make_customer_record("Meredith")


.. _`fixture-parametrize`:

Parametrizing fixtures
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Fixture functions can be parametrized in which case they will be called
multiple times, each time executing the set of dependent tests, i.e. the
tests that depend on this fixture.  Test functions usually do not need
to be aware of their re-running.  Fixture parametrization helps to
write exhaustive functional tests for components which themselves can be
configured in multiple ways.

Extending the previous example, we can flag the fixture to create two
``smtp_connection`` fixture instances which will cause all tests using the fixture
to run twice.  The fixture function gets access to each parameter
through the special :py:class:`request <pytest.FixtureRequest>` object:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py
    import smtplib

    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture(scope="module", params=["smtp.gmail.com", "mail.python.org"])
    def smtp_connection(request):
        smtp_connection = smtplib.SMTP(request.param, 587, timeout=5)
        yield smtp_connection
        print(f"finalizing {smtp_connection}")
        smtp_connection.close()

The main change is the declaration of ``params`` with
:py:func:`@pytest.fixture <pytest.fixture>`, a list of values
for each of which the fixture function will execute and can access
a value via ``request.param``.  No test function code needs to change.
So let's just do another run:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q test_module.py
    FFFF                                                                 [100%]

We see that our two test functions each ran twice, against the different
``smtp_connection`` instances.  Note also, that with the ``mail.python.org``
connection the second test fails in ``test_ehlo`` because a
different server string is expected than what arrived.

pytest will build a string that is the test ID for each fixture value
in a parametrized fixture, e.g. ``test_ehlo[smtp.gmail.com]`` and
``test_ehlo[mail.python.org]`` in the above examples.  These IDs can
be used with ``-k`` to select specific cases to run, and they will
also identify the specific case when one is failing.  Running pytest
with ``--collect-only`` will show the generated IDs.

Numbers, strings, booleans and ``None`` will have their usual string
representation used in the test ID. For other objects, pytest will
make a string based on the argument name.  It is possible to customise
the string used in a test ID for a certain fixture value by using the
``ids`` keyword argument:

.. code-block:: python

   # content of test_ids.py
   import pytest


   @pytest.fixture(params=[0, 1], ids=["spam", "ham"])
   def a(request):
       return request.param


   def test_a(a):
       pass


   def idfn(fixture_value):
       if fixture_value == 0:
           return "eggs"
       else:
           return None


   @pytest.fixture(params=[0, 1], ids=idfn)
   def b(request):
       return request.param


   def test_b(b):
       pass

The above shows how ``ids`` can be either a list of strings to use or
a function which will be called with the fixture value and then
has to return a string to use.  In the latter case if the function
returns ``None`` then pytest's auto-generated ID will be used.

Running the above tests results in the following test IDs being used:

.. _`fixture-parametrize-marks`:

Using marks with parametrized fixtures
--------------------------------------

:func:`pytest.param` can be used to apply marks in values sets of parametrized fixtures in the same way
that they can be used with :ref:`@pytest.mark.parametrize <@pytest.mark.parametrize>`.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_fixture_marks.py
    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture(params=[0, 1, pytest.param(2, marks=pytest.mark.skip)])
    def data_set(request):
        return request.param


    def test_data(data_set):
        pass

Running this test will *skip* the invocation of ``data_set`` with value ``2``:

.. _`interdependent fixtures`:

Modularity: using fixtures from a fixture function
----------------------------------------------------------

In addition to using fixtures in test functions, fixture functions
can use other fixtures themselves.  This contributes to a modular design
of your fixtures and allows reuse of framework-specific fixtures across
many projects.  As a simple example, we can extend the previous example
and instantiate an object ``app`` where we stick the already defined
``smtp_connection`` resource into it:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_appsetup.py

    import pytest


    class App:
        def __init__(self, smtp_connection):
            self.smtp_connection = smtp_connection


    @pytest.fixture(scope="module")
    def app(smtp_connection):
        return App(smtp_connection)


    def test_smtp_connection_exists(app):
        assert app.smtp_connection

Here we declare an ``app`` fixture which receives the previously defined
``smtp_connection`` fixture and instantiates an ``App`` object with it.  Let's run it:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -v test_appsetup.py
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python
    cachedir: .pytest_cache
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collecting ... collected 2 items

    test_appsetup.py::test_smtp_connection_exists[smtp.gmail.com] PASSED [ 50%]
    test_appsetup.py::test_smtp_connection_exists[mail.python.org] PASSED [100%]

    ============================ 2 passed in 0.12s =============================

Due to the parametrization of ``smtp_connection``, the test will run twice with two
different ``App`` instances and respective smtp servers.  There is no
need for the ``app`` fixture to be aware of the ``smtp_connection``
parametrization because pytest will fully analyse the fixture dependency graph.

Note that the ``app`` fixture has a scope of ``module`` and uses a
module-scoped ``smtp_connection`` fixture.  The example would still work if
``smtp_connection`` was cached on a ``session`` scope: it is fine for fixtures to use
"broader" scoped fixtures but not the other way round:
A session-scoped fixture could not use a module-scoped one in a
meaningful way.


.. _`automatic per-resource grouping`:

Automatic grouping of tests by fixture instances
----------------------------------------------------------

.. regendoc: wipe

pytest minimizes the number of active fixtures during test runs.
If you have a parametrized fixture, then all the tests using it will
first execute with one instance and then finalizers are called
before the next fixture instance is created.  Among other things,
this eases testing of applications which create and use global state.

The following example uses two parametrized fixtures, one of which is
scoped on a per-module basis, and all the functions perform ``print`` calls
to show the setup/teardown flow:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_module.py
    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture(scope="module", params=["mod1", "mod2"])
    def modarg(request):
        param = request.param
        print("  SETUP modarg", param)
        yield param
        print("  TEARDOWN modarg", param)


    @pytest.fixture(scope="function", params=[1, 2])
    def otherarg(request):
        param = request.param
        print("  SETUP otherarg", param)
        yield param
        print("  TEARDOWN otherarg", param)


    def test_0(otherarg):
        print("  RUN test0 with otherarg", otherarg)


    def test_1(modarg):
        print("  RUN test1 with modarg", modarg)


    def test_2(otherarg, modarg):
        print(f"  RUN test2 with otherarg {otherarg} and modarg {modarg}")


Let's run the tests in verbose mode and with looking at the print-output:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -v -s test_module.py
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python

      RUN test2 with otherarg 2 and modarg mod2
    PASSED  TEARDOWN otherarg 2
      TEARDOWN modarg mod2


    ============================ 8 passed in 0.12s =============================

You can see that the parametrized module-scoped ``modarg`` resource caused an
ordering of test execution that lead to the fewest possible "active" resources.
The finalizer for the ``mod1`` parametrized resource was executed before the
``mod2`` resource was setup.

In particular notice that test_0 is completely independent and finishes first.
Then test_1 is executed with ``mod1``, then test_2 with ``mod1``, then test_1
with ``mod2`` and finally test_2 with ``mod2``.

The ``otherarg`` parametrized resource (having function scope) was set up before
and teared down after every test that used it.


.. _`usefixtures`:

Use fixtures in classes and modules with ``usefixtures``
--------------------------------------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

Sometimes test functions do not directly need access to a fixture object.
For example, tests may require to operate with an empty directory as the
current working directory but otherwise do not care for the concrete
directory.  Here is how you can use the standard :mod:`tempfile`
and pytest fixtures to
achieve it.  We separate the creation of the fixture into a :file:`conftest.py`
file:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py

    import os
    import tempfile

    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture
    def cleandir():
        with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as newpath:
            old_cwd = os.getcwd()
            os.chdir(newpath)
            yield
            os.chdir(old_cwd)

and declare its use in a test module via a ``usefixtures`` marker:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_setenv.py
    import os

    import pytest


    @pytest.mark.usefixtures("cleandir")
    class TestDirectoryInit:
        def test_cwd_starts_empty(self):
            assert os.listdir(os.getcwd()) == []
            with open("myfile", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                f.write("hello")

        def test_cwd_again_starts_empty(self):
            assert os.listdir(os.getcwd()) == []

Due to the ``usefixtures`` marker, the ``cleandir`` fixture
will be required for the execution of each test method, just as if
you specified a "cleandir" function argument to each of them.  Let's run it
to verify our fixture is activated and the tests pass:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q
    ..                                                                   [100%]
    2 passed in 0.12s

You can specify multiple fixtures like this:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.usefixtures("cleandir", "anotherfixture")
    def test(): ...

and you may specify fixture usage at the test module level using :globalvar:`pytestmark`:

.. code-block:: python

    pytestmark = pytest.mark.usefixtures("cleandir")


It is also possible to put fixtures required by all tests in your project
into an ini-file:

.. code-block:: ini

    # content of pytest.ini
    [pytest]
    usefixtures = cleandir


.. warning::

    Note this mark has no effect in **fixture functions**. For example,
    this **will not work as expected**:

    .. code-block:: python

        @pytest.mark.usefixtures("my_other_fixture")
        @pytest.fixture
        def my_fixture_that_sadly_wont_use_my_other_fixture(): ...

    This generates a deprecation warning, and will become an error in Pytest 8.

.. _`override fixtures`:

Overriding fixtures on various levels
-------------------------------------

In relatively large test suite, you most likely need to ``override`` a ``global`` or ``root`` fixture with a ``locally``
defined one, keeping the test code readable and maintainable.

Override a fixture on a folder (conftest) level
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Given the tests file structure is:

::

    tests/
        conftest.py
            # content of tests/conftest.py
            import pytest

            @pytest.fixture
            def username():
                return 'username'

        test_something.py
            # content of tests/test_something.py
            def test_username(username):
                assert username == 'username'

        subfolder/
            conftest.py
                # content of tests/subfolder/conftest.py
                import pytest

                @pytest.fixture
                def username(username):
                    return 'overridden-' + username

            test_something_else.py
                # content of tests/subfolder/test_something_else.py
                def test_username(username):
                    assert username == 'overridden-username'

As you can see, a fixture with the same name can be overridden for certain test folder level.
Note that the ``base`` or ``super`` fixture can be accessed from the ``overriding``
fixture easily - used in the example above.

Override a fixture on a test module level
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Given the tests file structure is:

::

    tests/
        conftest.py
            # content of tests/conftest.py
            import pytest

            @pytest.fixture
            def username():
                return 'username'

        test_something.py
            # content of tests/test_something.py
            import pytest

            @pytest.fixture
            def username(username):
                return 'overridden-' + username

            def test_username(username):
                assert username == 'overridden-username'

        test_something_else.py
            # content of tests/test_something_else.py
            import pytest

            @pytest.fixture
            def username(username):
                return 'overridden-else-' + username

            def test_username(username):
                assert username == 'overridden-else-username'

In the example above, a fixture with the same name can be overridden for certain test module.


Override a fixture with direct test parametrization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Given the tests file structure is:

::

    tests/
        conftest.py
            # content of tests/conftest.py
            import pytest

            @pytest.fixture
            def username():
                return 'username'

            @pytest.fixture
            def other_username(username):
                return 'other-' + username

        test_something.py
            # content of tests/test_something.py
            import pytest

            @pytest.mark.parametrize('username', ['directly-overridden-username'])
            def test_username(username):
                assert username == 'directly-overridden-username'

            @pytest.mark.parametrize('username', ['directly-overridden-username-other'])
            def test_username_other(other_username):
                assert other_username == 'other-directly-overridden-username-other'

In the example above, a fixture value is overridden by the test parameter value. Note that the value of the fixture
can be overridden this way even if the test doesn't use it directly (doesn't mention it in the function prototype).


Override a parametrized fixture with non-parametrized one and vice versa
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Given the tests file structure is:

::

    tests/
        conftest.py
            # content of tests/conftest.py
            import pytest

            @pytest.fixture(params=['one', 'two', 'three'])
            def parametrized_username(request):
                return request.param

            @pytest.fixture
            def non_parametrized_username(request):
                return 'username'

        test_something.py
            # content of tests/test_something.py
            import pytest

            @pytest.fixture
            def parametrized_username():
                return 'overridden-username'

            @pytest.fixture(params=['one', 'two', 'three'])
            def non_parametrized_username(request):
                return request.param

            def test_username(parametrized_username):
                assert parametrized_username == 'overridden-username'

            def test_parametrized_username(non_parametrized_username):
                assert non_parametrized_username in ['one', 'two', 'three']

        test_something_else.py
            # content of tests/test_something_else.py
            def test_username(parametrized_username):
                assert parametrized_username in ['one', 'two', 'three']

            def test_username(non_parametrized_username):
                assert non_parametrized_username == 'username'

In the example above, a parametrized fixture is overridden with a non-parametrized version, and
a non-parametrized fixture is overridden with a parametrized version for certain test module.
The same applies for the test folder level obviously.


Using fixtures from other projects
----------------------------------

Usually projects that provide pytest support will use :ref:`entry points <pip-installable plugins>`,
so just installing those projects into an environment will make those fixtures available for use.

In case you want to use fixtures from a project that does not use entry points, you can
define :globalvar:`pytest_plugins` in your top ``conftest.py`` file to register that module
as a plugin.

Suppose you have some fixtures in ``mylibrary.fixtures`` and you want to reuse them into your
``app/tests`` directory.

All you need to do is to define :globalvar:`pytest_plugins` in ``app/tests/conftest.py``
pointing to that module.

.. code-block:: python

    pytest_plugins = "mylibrary.fixtures"

This effectively registers ``mylibrary.fixtures`` as a plugin, making all its fixtures and
hooks available to tests in ``app/tests``.

.. note::

    Sometimes users will *import* fixtures from other projects for use, however this is not
    recommended: importing fixtures into a module will register them in pytest
    as *defined* in that module.

    This has minor consequences, such as appearing multiple times in ``pytest --help``,
    but it is not **recommended** because this behavior might change/stop working
    in future versions.

````
.. _logging:

How to manage logging
---------------------

pytest captures log messages of level ``WARNING`` or above automatically and displays them in their own section
for each failed test in the same manner as captured stdout and stderr.

Running without options:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest

Shows failed tests like so:

.. code-block:: pytest

    ----------------------- Captured stdlog call ----------------------
    test_reporting.py    26 WARNING  text going to logger
    ----------------------- Captured stdout call ----------------------
    text going to stdout
    ----------------------- Captured stderr call ----------------------
    text going to stderr
    ==================== 2 failed in 0.02 seconds =====================

By default each captured log message shows the module, line number, log level
and message.

If desired the log and date format can be specified to
anything that the logging module supports by passing specific formatting options:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --log-format="%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s" \
            --log-date-format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

Shows failed tests like so:

.. code-block:: pytest

    ----------------------- Captured stdlog call ----------------------
    2010-04-10 14:48:44 WARNING text going to logger
    ----------------------- Captured stdout call ----------------------
    text going to stdout
    ----------------------- Captured stderr call ----------------------
    text going to stderr
    ==================== 2 failed in 0.02 seconds =====================

These options can also be customized through ``pytest.ini`` file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    log_format = %(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s
    log_date_format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S

Specific loggers can be disabled via ``--log-disable={logger_name}``.
This argument can be passed multiple times:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --log-disable=main --log-disable=testing

Further it is possible to disable reporting of captured content (stdout,
stderr and logs) on failed tests completely with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --show-capture=no


caplog fixture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inside tests it is possible to change the log level for the captured log
messages.  This is supported by the ``caplog`` fixture:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_foo(caplog):
        caplog.set_level(logging.INFO)

By default the level is set on the root logger,
however as a convenience it is also possible to set the log level of any
logger:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_foo(caplog):
        caplog.set_level(logging.CRITICAL, logger="root.baz")

The log levels set are restored automatically at the end of the test.

It is also possible to use a context manager to temporarily change the log
level inside a ``with`` block:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_bar(caplog):
        with caplog.at_level(logging.INFO):
            pass

Again, by default the level of the root logger is affected but the level of any
logger can be changed instead with:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_bar(caplog):
        with caplog.at_level(logging.CRITICAL, logger="root.baz"):
            pass

Lastly all the logs sent to the logger during the test run are made available on
the fixture in the form of both the ``logging.LogRecord`` instances and the final log text.
This is useful for when you want to assert on the contents of a message:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_baz(caplog):
        func_under_test()
        for record in caplog.records:
            assert record.levelname != "CRITICAL"
        assert "wally" not in caplog.text

For all the available attributes of the log records see the
``logging.LogRecord`` class.

You can also resort to ``record_tuples`` if all you want to do is to ensure,
that certain messages have been logged under a given logger name with a given
severity and message:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_foo(caplog):
        logging.getLogger().info("boo %s", "arg")

        assert caplog.record_tuples == [("root", logging.INFO, "boo arg")]

You can call ``caplog.clear()`` to reset the captured log records in a test:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_something_with_clearing_records(caplog):
        some_method_that_creates_log_records()
        caplog.clear()
        your_test_method()
        assert ["Foo"] == [rec.message for rec in caplog.records]


The ``caplog.records`` attribute contains records from the current stage only, so
inside the ``setup`` phase it contains only setup logs, same with the ``call`` and
``teardown`` phases.

To access logs from other stages, use the ``caplog.get_records(when)`` method. As an example,
if you want to make sure that tests which use a certain fixture never log any warnings, you can inspect
the records for the ``setup`` and ``call`` stages during teardown like so:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture
    def window(caplog):
        window = create_window()
        yield window
        for when in ("setup", "call"):
            messages = [
                x.message for x in caplog.get_records(when) if x.levelno == logging.WARNING
            ]
            if messages:
                pytest.fail(f"warning messages encountered during testing: {messages}")



The full API is available at :class:`pytest.LogCaptureFixture`.

.. warning::

    The ``caplog`` fixture adds a handler to the root logger to capture logs. If the root logger is
    modified during a test, for example with ``logging.config.dictConfig``, this handler may be
    removed and cause no logs to be captured. To avoid this, ensure that any root logger configuration
    only adds to the existing handlers.


.. _live_logs:

Live Logs
^^^^^^^^^

By setting the :confval:`log_cli` configuration option to ``true``, pytest will output
logging records as they are emitted directly into the console.

You can specify the logging level for which log records with equal or higher
level are printed to the console by passing ``--log-cli-level``. This setting
accepts the logging level names or numeric values as seen in
:ref:`logging's documentation <python:levels>`.

Additionally, you can also specify ``--log-cli-format`` and
``--log-cli-date-format`` which mirror and default to ``--log-format`` and
``--log-date-format`` if not provided, but are applied only to the console
logging handler.

All of the CLI log options can also be set in the configuration INI file. The
option names are:

* ``log_cli_level``
* ``log_cli_format``
* ``log_cli_date_format``

If you need to record the whole test suite logging calls to a file, you can pass
``--log-file=/path/to/log/file``. This log file is opened in write mode by default which
means that it will be overwritten at each run tests session.
If you'd like the file opened in append mode instead, then you can pass ``--log-file-mode=a``.
Note that relative paths for the log-file location, whether passed on the CLI or declared in a
config file, are always resolved relative to the current working directory.

You can also specify the logging level for the log file by passing
``--log-file-level``. This setting accepts the logging level names or numeric
values as seen in :ref:`logging's documentation <python:levels>`.

Additionally, you can also specify ``--log-file-format`` and
``--log-file-date-format`` which are equal to ``--log-format`` and
``--log-date-format`` but are applied to the log file logging handler.

All of the log file options can also be set in the configuration INI file. The
option names are:

* ``log_file``
* ``log_file_mode``
* ``log_file_level``
* ``log_file_format``
* ``log_file_date_format``

You can call ``set_log_path()`` to customize the log_file path dynamically. This functionality
is considered **experimental**. Note that ``set_log_path()`` respects the ``log_file_mode`` option.

.. _log_colors:

Customizing Colors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Log levels are colored if colored terminal output is enabled. Changing
from default colors or putting color on custom log levels is supported
through ``add_color_level()``. Example:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.hookimpl(trylast=True)
    def pytest_configure(config):
        logging_plugin = config.pluginmanager.get_plugin("logging-plugin")

        # Change color on existing log level
        logging_plugin.log_cli_handler.formatter.add_color_level(logging.INFO, "cyan")

        # Add color to a custom log level (a custom log level `SPAM` is already set up)
        logging_plugin.log_cli_handler.formatter.add_color_level(logging.SPAM, "blue")
.. warning::

    This feature and its API are considered **experimental** and might change
    between releases without a deprecation notice.
.. _log_release_notes:

Release notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This feature was introduced as a drop-in replacement for the
:pypi:`pytest-catchlog` plugin and they conflict
with each other. The backward compatibility API with ``pytest-capturelog``
has been dropped when this feature was introduced, so if for that reason you
still need ``pytest-catchlog`` you can disable the internal feature by
adding to your ``pytest.ini``:

.. code-block:: ini

   [pytest]
       addopts=-p no:logging


.. _log_changes_3_4:

Incompatible changes in pytest 3.4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This feature was introduced in ``3.3`` and some **incompatible changes** have been
made in ``3.4`` after community feedback:

* Log levels are no longer changed unless explicitly requested by the :confval:`log_level` configuration
  or ``--log-level`` command-line options. This allows users to configure logger objects themselves.
  Setting :confval:`log_level` will set the level that is captured globally so if a specific test requires
  a lower level than this, use the ``caplog.set_level()`` functionality otherwise that test will be prone to
  failure.
* :ref:`Live Logs <live_logs>` is now disabled by default and can be enabled setting the
  :confval:`log_cli` configuration option to ``true``. When enabled, the verbosity is increased so logging for each
  test is visible.
* :ref:`Live Logs <live_logs>` are now sent to ``sys.stdout`` and no longer require the ``-s`` command-line option
  to work.

If you want to partially restore the logging behavior of version ``3.3``, you can add this options to your ``ini``
file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    log_cli=true
    log_level=NOTSET

More details about the discussion that lead to this changes can be read in :issue:`3013`.

## File: doc/en/how-to/mark.rst

.. _mark:

How to mark test functions with attributes
===========================================

By using the ``pytest.mark`` helper you can easily set
metadata on your test functions. You can find the full list of builtin markers
in the :ref:`API Reference<marks ref>`. Or you can list all the markers, including
builtin and custom, using the CLI - :code:`pytest --markers`.

Here are some of the builtin markers:

* :ref:`usefixtures <usefixtures>` - use fixtures on a test function or class
* :ref:`filterwarnings <filterwarnings>` - filter certain warnings of a test function
* :ref:`skip <skip>` - always skip a test function
* :ref:`skipif <skipif>` - skip a test function if a certain condition is met
* :ref:`xfail <xfail>` - produce an "expected failure" outcome if a certain
  condition is met
* :ref:`parametrize <parametrizemark>` - perform multiple calls
  to the same test function.

It's easy to create custom markers or to apply markers
to whole test classes or modules. Those markers can be used by plugins, and also
are commonly used to :ref:`select tests <mark run>` on the command-line with the ``-m`` option.

See :ref:`mark examples` for examples which also serve as documentation.

.. note::

    Marks can only be applied to tests, having no effect on
    :ref:`fixtures <fixtures>`.


Registering marks
-----------------

You can register custom marks in your ``pytest.ini`` file like this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    markers =
        slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
        serial

or in your ``pyproject.toml`` file like this:

.. code-block:: toml

    [tool.pytest.ini_options]
    markers = [
        "slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m \"not slow\"')",
        "serial",
    ]

Note that everything past the ``:`` after the mark name is an optional description.

Alternatively, you can register new markers programmatically in a
:ref:`pytest_configure <initialization-hooks>` hook:

.. code-block:: python

    def pytest_configure(config):
        config.addinivalue_line(
            "markers", "env(name): mark test to run only on named environment"
        )


Registered marks appear in pytest's help text and do not emit warnings (see the next section). It
is recommended that third-party plugins always :ref:`register their markers <registering-markers>`.

.. _unknown-marks:

Raising errors on unknown marks
-------------------------------

Unregistered marks applied with the ``@pytest.mark.name_of_the_mark`` decorator
will always emit a warning in order to avoid silently doing something
surprising due to mistyped names. As described in the previous section, you can disable
the warning for custom marks by registering them in your ``pytest.ini`` file or
using a custom ``pytest_configure`` hook.

When the ``--strict-markers`` command-line flag is passed, any unknown marks applied
with the ``@pytest.mark.name_of_the_mark`` decorator will trigger an error. You can
enforce this validation in your project by adding ``--strict-markers`` to ``addopts``:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    addopts = --strict-markers
    markers =
        slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
        serial

````
.. _monkeypatching:

How to monkeypatch/mock modules and environments
================================================================

.. currentmodule:: pytest

Sometimes tests need to invoke functionality which depends
on global settings or which invokes code which cannot be easily
tested such as network access.  The ``monkeypatch`` fixture
helps you to safely set/delete an attribute, dictionary item or
environment variable, or to modify ``sys.path`` for importing.

The ``monkeypatch`` fixture provides these helper methods for safely patching and mocking
functionality in tests:

* :meth:`monkeypatch.setattr(obj, name, value, raising=True) <pytest.MonkeyPatch.setattr>`
* :meth:`monkeypatch.delattr(obj, name, raising=True) <pytest.MonkeyPatch.delattr>`
* :meth:`monkeypatch.setitem(mapping, name, value) <pytest.MonkeyPatch.setitem>`
* :meth:`monkeypatch.delitem(obj, name, raising=True) <pytest.MonkeyPatch.delitem>`
* :meth:`monkeypatch.setenv(name, value, prepend=None) <pytest.MonkeyPatch.setenv>`
* :meth:`monkeypatch.delenv(name, raising=True) <pytest.MonkeyPatch.delenv>`
* :meth:`monkeypatch.syspath_prepend(path) <pytest.MonkeyPatch.syspath_prepend>`
* :meth:`monkeypatch.chdir(path) <pytest.MonkeyPatch.chdir>`
* :meth:`monkeypatch.context() <pytest.MonkeyPatch.context>`


All modifications will be undone after the requesting
test function or fixture has finished. The ``raising``
parameter determines if a ``KeyError`` or ``AttributeError``
will be raised if the target of the set/deletion operation does not exist.

Consider the following scenarios:

1. Modifying the behavior of a function or the property of a class for a test e.g.
there is an API call or database connection you will not make for a test but you know
what the expected output should be. Use :py:meth:`monkeypatch.setattr <MonkeyPatch.setattr>` to patch the
function or property with your desired testing behavior. This can include your own functions.
Use :py:meth:`monkeypatch.delattr <MonkeyPatch.delattr>` to remove the function or property for the test.

2. Modifying the values of dictionaries e.g. you have a global configuration that
you want to modify for certain test cases. Use :py:meth:`monkeypatch.setitem <MonkeyPatch.setitem>` to patch the
dictionary for the test. :py:meth:`monkeypatch.delitem <MonkeyPatch.delitem>` can be used to remove items.

3. Modifying environment variables for a test e.g. to test program behavior if an
environment variable is missing, or to set multiple values to a known variable.
:py:meth:`monkeypatch.setenv <MonkeyPatch.setenv>` and :py:meth:`monkeypatch.delenv <MonkeyPatch.delenv>` can be used for
these patches.

4. Use ``monkeypatch.setenv("PATH", value, prepend=os.pathsep)`` to modify ``$PATH``, and
:py:meth:`monkeypatch.chdir <MonkeyPatch.chdir>` to change the context of the current working directory
during a test.

5. Use :py:meth:`monkeypatch.syspath_prepend <MonkeyPatch.syspath_prepend>` to modify ``sys.path`` which will also
call ``pkg_resources.fixup_namespace_packages`` and :py:func:`importlib.invalidate_caches`.

6. Use :py:meth:`monkeypatch.context <MonkeyPatch.context>` to apply patches only in a specific scope, which can help
control teardown of complex fixtures or patches to the stdlib.

See the `monkeypatch blog post`_ for some introduction material
and a discussion of its motivation.

.. _`monkeypatch blog post`: https://tetamap.wordpress.com//2009/03/03/monkeypatching-in-unit-tests-done-right/

Monkeypatching functions
------------------------

Consider a scenario where you are working with user directories. In the context of
testing, you do not want your test to depend on the running user. ``monkeypatch``
can be used to patch functions dependent on the user to always return a
specific value.

In this example, :py:meth:`monkeypatch.setattr <MonkeyPatch.setattr>` is used to patch ``Path.home``
so that the known testing path ``Path("/abc")`` is always used when the test is run.
This removes any dependency on the running user for testing purposes.
:py:meth:`monkeypatch.setattr <MonkeyPatch.setattr>` must be called before the function which will use
the patched function is called.
After the test function finishes the ``Path.home`` modification will be undone.

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of test_module.py with source code and the test
    from pathlib import Path


    def getssh():
        """Simple function to return expanded homedir ssh path."""
        return Path.home() / ".ssh"


    def test_getssh(monkeypatch):
        # mocked return function to replace Path.home
        # always return '/abc'
        def mockreturn():
            return Path("/abc")

        # Application of the monkeypatch to replace Path.home
        # with the behavior of mockreturn defined above.
        monkeypatch.setattr(Path, "home", mockreturn)

        # Calling getssh() will use mockreturn in place of Path.home
        # for this test with the monkeypatch.
        x = getssh()
        assert x == Path("/abc/.ssh")

Monkeypatching returned objects: building mock classes
------------------------------------------------------

:py:meth:`monkeypatch.setattr <MonkeyPatch.setattr>` can be used in conjunction with classes to mock returned
objects from functions instead of values.
Imagine a simple function to take an API url and return the json response.

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of app.py, a simple API retrieval example
    import requests


    def get_json(url):
        """Takes a URL, and returns the JSON."""
        r = requests.get(url)
        return r.json()

We need to mock ``r``, the returned response object for testing purposes.
The mock of ``r`` needs a ``.json()`` method which returns a dictionary.
This can be done in our test file by defining a class to represent ``r``.

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of test_app.py, a simple test for our API retrieval
    # import requests for the purposes of monkeypatching
    import requests

    # our app.py that includes the get_json() function
    # this is the previous code block example
    import app


    # custom class to be the mock return value
    # will override the requests.Response returned from requests.get
    class MockResponse:
        # mock json() method always returns a specific testing dictionary
        @staticmethod
        def json():
            return {"mock_key": "mock_response"}


    def test_get_json(monkeypatch):
        # Any arguments may be passed and mock_get() will always return our
        # mocked object, which only has the .json() method.
        def mock_get(*args, **kwargs):
            return MockResponse()

        # apply the monkeypatch for requests.get to mock_get
        monkeypatch.setattr(requests, "get", mock_get)

        # app.get_json, which contains requests.get, uses the monkeypatch
        result = app.get_json("https://fakeurl")
        assert result["mock_key"] == "mock_response"


``monkeypatch`` applies the mock for ``requests.get`` with our ``mock_get`` function.
The ``mock_get`` function returns an instance of the ``MockResponse`` class, which
has a ``json()`` method defined to return a known testing dictionary and does not
require any outside API connection.

You can build the ``MockResponse`` class with the appropriate degree of complexity for
the scenario you are testing. For instance, it could include an ``ok`` property that
always returns ``True``, or return different values from the ``json()`` mocked method
based on input strings.

This mock can be shared across tests using a ``fixture``:

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of test_app.py, a simple test for our API retrieval
    import pytest
    import requests

    # app.py that includes the get_json() function
    import app


    # custom class to be the mock return value of requests.get()
    class MockResponse:
        @staticmethod
        def json():
            return {"mock_key": "mock_response"}


    # monkeypatched requests.get moved to a fixture
    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_response(monkeypatch):
        """Requests.get() mocked to return {'mock_key':'mock_response'}."""

        def mock_get(*args, **kwargs):
            return MockResponse()

        monkeypatch.setattr(requests, "get", mock_get)


    # notice our test uses the custom fixture instead of monkeypatch directly
    def test_get_json(mock_response):
        result = app.get_json("https://fakeurl")
        assert result["mock_key"] == "mock_response"


Furthermore, if the mock was designed to be applied to all tests, the ``fixture`` could
be moved to a ``conftest.py`` file and use the with ``autouse=True`` option.


Global patch example: preventing "requests" from remote operations
------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to prevent the "requests" library from performing http
requests in all your tests, you can do:

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of conftest.py
    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
    def no_requests(monkeypatch):
        """Remove requests.sessions.Session.request for all tests."""
        monkeypatch.delattr("requests.sessions.Session.request")

This autouse fixture will be executed for each test function and it
will delete the method ``request.session.Session.request``
so that any attempts within tests to create http requests will fail.


.. note::

    Be advised that it is not recommended to patch builtin functions such as ``open``,
    ``compile``, etc., because it might break pytest's internals. If that's
    unavoidable, passing ``--tb=native``, ``--assert=plain`` and ``--capture=no`` might
    help although there's no guarantee.

.. note::

    Mind that patching ``stdlib`` functions and some third-party libraries used by pytest
    might break pytest itself, therefore in those cases it is recommended to use
    :meth:`MonkeyPatch.context` to limit the patching to the block you want tested:

    .. code-block:: python

        import functools


        def test_partial(monkeypatch):
            with monkeypatch.context() as m:
                m.setattr(functools, "partial", 3)
                assert functools.partial == 3

    See :issue:`3290` for details.


Monkeypatching environment variables
------------------------------------

If you are working with environment variables you often need to safely change the values
or delete them from the system for testing purposes. ``monkeypatch`` provides a mechanism
to do this using the ``setenv`` and ``delenv`` method. Our example code to test:

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of our original code file e.g. code.py
    import os


    def get_os_user_lower():
        """Simple retrieval function.
        Returns lowercase USER or raises OSError."""
        username = os.getenv("USER")

        if username is None:
            raise OSError("USER environment is not set.")

        return username.lower()

There are two potential paths. First, the ``USER`` environment variable is set to a
value. Second, the ``USER`` environment variable does not exist. Using ``monkeypatch``
both paths can be safely tested without impacting the running environment:

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of our test file e.g. test_code.py
    import pytest


    def test_upper_to_lower(monkeypatch):
        """Set the USER env var to assert the behavior."""
        monkeypatch.setenv("USER", "TestingUser")
        assert get_os_user_lower() == "testinguser"


    def test_raise_exception(monkeypatch):
        """Remove the USER env var and assert OSError is raised."""
        monkeypatch.delenv("USER", raising=False)

        with pytest.raises(OSError):
            _ = get_os_user_lower()

This behavior can be moved into ``fixture`` structures and shared across tests:

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of our test file e.g. test_code.py
    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_env_user(monkeypatch):
        monkeypatch.setenv("USER", "TestingUser")


    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_env_missing(monkeypatch):
        monkeypatch.delenv("USER", raising=False)


    # notice the tests reference the fixtures for mocks
    def test_upper_to_lower(mock_env_user):
        assert get_os_user_lower() == "testinguser"


    def test_raise_exception(mock_env_missing):
        with pytest.raises(OSError):
            _ = get_os_user_lower()


Monkeypatching dictionaries
---------------------------

:py:meth:`monkeypatch.setitem <MonkeyPatch.setitem>` can be used to safely set the values of dictionaries
to specific values during tests. Take this simplified connection string example:

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of app.py to generate a simple connection string
    DEFAULT_CONFIG = {"user": "user1", "database": "db1"}


    def create_connection_string(config=None):
        """Creates a connection string from input or defaults."""
        config = config or DEFAULT_CONFIG
        return f"User Id={config['user']}; Location={config['database']};"

For testing purposes we can patch the ``DEFAULT_CONFIG`` dictionary to specific values.

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of test_app.py
    # app.py with the connection string function (prior code block)
    import app


    def test_connection(monkeypatch):
        # Patch the values of DEFAULT_CONFIG to specific
        # testing values only for this test.
        monkeypatch.setitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "user", "test_user")
        monkeypatch.setitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "database", "test_db")

        # expected result based on the mocks
        expected = "User Id=test_user; Location=test_db;"

        # the test uses the monkeypatched dictionary settings
        result = app.create_connection_string()
        assert result == expected

You can use the :py:meth:`monkeypatch.delitem <MonkeyPatch.delitem>` to remove values.

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of test_app.py
    import pytest

    # app.py with the connection string function
    import app


    def test_missing_user(monkeypatch):
        # patch the DEFAULT_CONFIG t be missing the 'user' key
        monkeypatch.delitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "user", raising=False)

        # Key error expected because a config is not passed, and the
        # default is now missing the 'user' entry.
        with pytest.raises(KeyError):
            _ = app.create_connection_string()


The modularity of fixtures gives you the flexibility to define
separate fixtures for each potential mock and reference them in the needed tests.

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of test_app.py
    import pytest

    # app.py with the connection string function
    import app


    # all of the mocks are moved into separated fixtures
    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_test_user(monkeypatch):
        """Set the DEFAULT_CONFIG user to test_user."""
        monkeypatch.setitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "user", "test_user")


    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_test_database(monkeypatch):
        """Set the DEFAULT_CONFIG database to test_db."""
        monkeypatch.setitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "database", "test_db")


    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_missing_default_user(monkeypatch):
        """Remove the user key from DEFAULT_CONFIG"""
        monkeypatch.delitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "user", raising=False)


    # tests reference only the fixture mocks that are needed
    def test_connection(mock_test_user, mock_test_database):
        expected = "User Id=test_user; Location=test_db;"

        result = app.create_connection_string()
        assert result == expected


    def test_missing_user(mock_missing_default_user):
        with pytest.raises(KeyError):
            _ = app.create_connection_string()

.. _how-to-manage-output:

Managing pytest's output
=========================

.. _how-to-modifying-python-tb-printing:

Modifying Python traceback printing
--------------------------------------------------

Examples for modifying traceback printing:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --showlocals     # show local variables in tracebacks
    pytest -l               # show local variables (shortcut)
    pytest --no-showlocals  # hide local variables (if addopts enables them)

    pytest --capture=fd  # default, capture at the file descriptor level
    pytest --capture=sys # capture at the sys level
    pytest --capture=no  # don't capture
    pytest -s            # don't capture (shortcut)
    pytest --capture=tee-sys # capture to logs but also output to sys level streams

    pytest --tb=auto    # (default) 'long' tracebacks for the first and last
                         # entry, but 'short' style for the other entries
    pytest --tb=long    # exhaustive, informative traceback formatting
    pytest --tb=short   # shorter traceback format
    pytest --tb=line    # only one line per failure
    pytest --tb=native  # Python standard library formatting
    pytest --tb=no      # no traceback at all

The ``--full-trace`` causes very long traces to be printed on error (longer
than ``--tb=long``). It also ensures that a stack trace is printed on
**KeyboardInterrupt** (Ctrl+C).
This is very useful if the tests are taking too long and you interrupt them
with Ctrl+C to find out where the tests are *hanging*. By default no output
will be shown (because KeyboardInterrupt is caught by pytest). By using this
option you make sure a trace is shown.


Verbosity
--------------------------------------------------

Examples for modifying printing verbosity:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --quiet          # quiet - less verbose - mode
    pytest -q               # quiet - less verbose - mode (shortcut)
    pytest -v               # increase verbosity, display individual test names
    pytest -vv              # more verbose, display more details from the test output
    pytest -vvv             # not a standard , but may be used for even more detail in certain setups

The ``-v`` flag controls the verbosity of pytest output in various aspects: test session progress, assertion
details when tests fail, fixtures details with ``--fixtures``, etc.

.. regendoc:wipe

Consider this simple file:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_verbosity_example.py
    def test_ok():
        pass


    def test_words_fail():
        fruits1 = ["banana", "apple", "grapes", "melon", "kiwi"]
        fruits2 = ["banana", "apple", "orange", "melon", "kiwi"]
        assert fruits1 == fruits2

    ======================= 3 failed, 1 passed in 0.12s ========================

Notice now that:

* Each test inside the file gets its own line in the output.
* ``test_words_fail`` gives the same output as before in this case.
* ``test_numbers_fail`` now shows a full text diff of the two dictionaries.
* ``test_long_text_fail`` also doesn't truncate on the right hand side as before, but now pytest won't truncate any
  text at all, regardless of its size.

Those were examples of how verbosity affects normal test session output, but verbosity also is used in other
situations, for example you are shown even fixtures that start with ``_`` if you use ``pytest --fixtures -v``.

Using higher verbosity levels (``-vvv``, ``-vvvv``, ...) is supported, but has no effect in pytest itself at the moment,
however some plugins might make use of higher verbosity.

.. _`pytest.fine_grained_verbosity`:

Fine-grained verbosity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to specifying the application wide verbosity level, it is possible to control specific aspects independently.
This is done by setting a verbosity level in the configuration file for the specific aspect of the output.

:confval:`verbosity_assertions`: Controls how verbose the assertion output should be when pytest is executed. Running
``pytest --no-header`` with a value of ``2`` would have the same output as the previous example, but each test inside
the file is shown by a single character in the output.

:confval:`verbosity_test_cases`: Controls how verbose the test execution output should be when pytest is executed.
Running ``pytest --no-header`` with a value of ``2`` would have the same output as the first verbosity example, but each
test inside the file gets its own line in the output.

.. _`pytest.detailed_failed_tests_usage`:

Producing a detailed summary report
--------------------------------------------------

The ``-r`` flag can be used to display a "short test summary info" at the end of the test session,
making it easy in large test suites to get a clear picture of all failures, skips, xfails, etc.

It defaults to ``fE`` to list failures and errors.

.. code-block:: python

The ``-r`` options accepts a number of characters after it, with ``a`` used
above meaning "all except passes".

Here is the full list of available characters that can be used:

 - ``f`` - failed
 - ``E`` - error
 - ``s`` - skipped
 - ``x`` - xfailed
 - ``X`` - xpassed
 - ``p`` - passed
 - ``P`` - passed with output

Special characters for (de)selection of groups:

 - ``a`` - all except ``pP``
 - ``A`` - all
 - ``N`` - none, this can be used to display nothing (since ``fE`` is the default)

More than one character can be used, so for example to only see failed and skipped tests, you can execute:

.. note::

    By default, parametrized variants of skipped tests are grouped together if
    they share the same skip reason. You can use ``--no-fold-skipped`` to print each skipped test separately.


.. _truncation-params:

Modifying truncation limits
--------------------------------------------------

.. versionadded: 8.4

Default truncation limits are 8 lines or 640 characters, whichever comes first.
To set custom truncation limits you can use following ``pytest.ini`` file options:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    truncation_limit_lines = 10
    truncation_limit_chars = 90

That will cause pytest to truncate the assertions to 10 lines or 90 characters, whichever comes first.

Setting both :confval:`truncation_limit_lines` and :confval:`truncation_limit_chars` to ``0`` will disable the truncation.
However, setting only one of those values will disable one truncation mode, but will leave the other one intact.


Creating JUnitXML format files
----------------------------------------------------

To create result files which can be read by Jenkins_ or other Continuous
integration servers, use this invocation:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --junit-xml=path

to create an XML file at ``path``.



To set the name of the root test suite xml item, you can configure the ``junit_suite_name`` option in your config file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    junit_suite_name = my_suite

.. versionadded:: 4.0

JUnit XML specification seems to indicate that ``"time"`` attribute
should report total test execution times, including setup and teardown
(`1 <http://windyroad.com.au/dl/Open%20Source/JUnit.xsd>`_, `2
<https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQ2R2_14.1.0/com.ibm.rsar.analysis.codereview.cobol.doc/topics/cac_useresults_junit.html>`_).
It is the default pytest behavior. To report just call durations
instead, configure the ``junit_duration_report`` option like this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    junit_duration_report = call

.. _record_property example:

record_property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to log additional information for a test, you can use the
``record_property`` fixture:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_function(record_property):
        record_property("example_key", 1)
        assert True

This will add an extra property ``example_key="1"`` to the generated
``testcase`` tag:

.. code-block:: xml

    <testcase classname="test_function" file="test_function.py" line="0" name="test_function" time="0.0009">
      <properties>
        <property name="example_key" value="1" />
      </properties>
    </testcase>

Alternatively, you can integrate this functionality with custom markers:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py


    def pytest_collection_modifyitems(session, config, items):
        for item in items:
            for marker in item.iter_markers(name="test_id"):
                test_id = marker.args[0]
                item.user_properties.append(("test_id", test_id))

And in your tests:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_function.py
    import pytest


    @pytest.mark.test_id(1501)
    def test_function():
        assert True

Will result in:

.. code-block:: xml

    <testcase classname="test_function" file="test_function.py" line="0" name="test_function" time="0.0009">
      <properties>
        <property name="test_id" value="1501" />
      </properties>
    </testcase>

.. warning::

    Please note that using this feature will break schema verifications for the latest JUnitXML schema.
    This might be a problem when used with some CI servers.


record_xml_attribute
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add an additional xml attribute to a testcase element, you can use
``record_xml_attribute`` fixture. This can also be used to override existing values:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_function(record_xml_attribute):
        record_xml_attribute("assertions", "REQ-1234")
        record_xml_attribute("classname", "custom_classname")
        print("hello world")
        assert True

Unlike ``record_property``, this will not add a new child element.
Instead, this will add an attribute ``assertions="REQ-1234"`` inside the generated
``testcase`` tag and override the default ``classname`` with ``"classname=custom_classname"``:

.. code-block:: xml

    <testcase classname="custom_classname" file="test_function.py" line="0" name="test_function" time="0.003" assertions="REQ-1234">
        <system-out>
            hello world
        </system-out>
    </testcase>

.. warning::

    ``record_xml_attribute`` is an experimental feature, and its interface might be replaced
    by something more powerful and general in future versions. The
    functionality per-se will be kept, however.

    Using this over ``record_xml_property`` can help when using ci tools to parse the xml report.
    However, some parsers are quite strict about the elements and attributes that are allowed.
    Many tools use an xsd schema (like the example below) to validate incoming xml.
    Make sure you are using attribute names that are allowed by your parser.

    Below is the Scheme used by Jenkins to validate the XML report:

    .. code-block:: xml

        <xs:element name="testcase">
            <xs:complexType>
                <xs:sequence>
                    <xs:element ref="skipped" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
                    <xs:element ref="error" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
                    <xs:element ref="failure" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
                    <xs:element ref="system-out" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
                    <xs:element ref="system-err" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
                </xs:sequence>
                <xs:attribute name="name" type="xs:string" use="required"/>
                <xs:attribute name="assertions" type="xs:string" use="optional"/>
                <xs:attribute name="time" type="xs:string" use="optional"/>
                <xs:attribute name="classname" type="xs:string" use="optional"/>
                <xs:attribute name="status" type="xs:string" use="optional"/>
            </xs:complexType>
        </xs:element>

.. warning::

    Please note that using this feature will break schema verifications for the latest JUnitXML schema.
    This might be a problem when used with some CI servers.

.. _record_testsuite_property example:

record_testsuite_property
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 4.5

If you want to add a properties node at the test-suite level, which may contains properties
that are relevant to all tests, you can use the ``record_testsuite_property`` session-scoped fixture:

The ``record_testsuite_property`` session-scoped fixture can be used to add properties relevant
to all tests.

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
    def log_global_env_facts(record_testsuite_property):
        record_testsuite_property("ARCH", "PPC")
        record_testsuite_property("STORAGE_TYPE", "CEPH")


    class TestMe:
        def test_foo(self):
            assert True

The fixture is a callable which receives ``name`` and ``value`` of a ``<property>`` tag
added at the test-suite level of the generated xml:

.. code-block:: xml

    <testsuite errors="0" failures="0" name="pytest" skipped="0" tests="1" time="0.006">
      <properties>
        <property name="ARCH" value="PPC"/>
        <property name="STORAGE_TYPE" value="CEPH"/>
      </properties>
      <testcase classname="test_me.TestMe" file="test_me.py" line="16" name="test_foo" time="0.000243663787842"/>
    </testsuite>

``name`` must be a string, ``value`` will be converted to a string and properly xml-escaped.

The generated XML is compatible with the latest ``xunit`` standard, contrary to `record_property`_
and `record_xml_attribute`_.


Sending test report to an online pastebin service
--------------------------------------------------

**Creating a URL for each test failure**:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --pastebin=failed

This will submit test run information to a remote Paste service and
provide a URL for each failure.  You may select tests as usual or add
for example ``-x`` if you only want to send one particular failure.

**Creating a URL for a whole test session log**:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --pastebin=all

Currently only pasting to the https://bpaste.net/ service is implemented.

.. versionchanged:: 5.2

If creating the URL fails for any reason, a warning is generated instead of failing the
entire test suite.

How to parametrize fixtures and test functions
==========================================================================

pytest enables test parametrization at several levels:

- :py:func:`pytest.fixture` allows one to :ref:`parametrize fixture
  functions <fixture-parametrize>`.

* `@pytest.mark.parametrize`_ allows one to define multiple sets of
  arguments and fixtures at the test function or class.

* `pytest_generate_tests`_ allows one to define custom parametrization
  schemes or extensions.

.. _parametrizemark:
.. _`@pytest.mark.parametrize`:


``@pytest.mark.parametrize``: parametrizing test functions
---------------------------------------------------------------------

.. regendoc: wipe

The builtin :ref:`pytest.mark.parametrize ref` decorator enables
parametrization of arguments for a test function.  Here is a typical example
of a test function that implements checking that a certain input leads
to an expected output:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_expectation.py
    import pytest


    @pytest.mark.parametrize("test_input,expected", [("3+5", 8), ("2+4", 6), ("6*9", 42)])
    def test_eval(test_input, expected):
        assert eval(test_input) == expected

Here, the ``@parametrize`` decorator defines three different ``(test_input,expected)``
tuples so that the ``test_eval`` function will run three times using
them in turn:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 3 items

    test_expectation.py ..F                                              [100%]

    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    ____________________________ test_eval[6*9-42] _____________________________

    test_input = '6*9', expected = 42

        @pytest.mark.parametrize("test_input,expected", [("3+5", 8), ("2+4", 6), ("6*9", 42)])
        def test_eval(test_input, expected):
    >       assert eval(test_input) == expected
    E       AssertionError: assert 54 == 42
    E        +  where 54 = eval('6*9')

    test_expectation.py:6: AssertionError
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_expectation.py::test_eval[6*9-42] - AssertionError: assert 54...
    ======================= 1 failed, 2 passed in 0.12s ========================

.. note::

    Parameter values are passed as-is to tests (no copy whatsoever).

    For example, if you pass a list or a dict as a parameter value, and
    the test case code mutates it, the mutations will be reflected in subsequent
    test case calls.

.. note::

    pytest by default escapes any non-ascii characters used in unicode strings
    for the parametrization because it has several downsides.
    If however you would like to use unicode strings in parametrization
    and see them in the terminal as is (non-escaped), use this option
    in your ``pytest.ini``:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        disable_test_id_escaping_and_forfeit_all_rights_to_community_support = True

    Keep in mind however that this might cause unwanted side effects and
    even bugs depending on the OS used and plugins currently installed,
    so use it at your own risk.


As designed in this example, only one pair of input/output values fails
the simple test function.  And as usual with test function arguments,
you can see the ``input`` and ``output`` values in the traceback.

Note that you could also use the parametrize marker on a class or a module
(see :ref:`mark`) which would invoke several functions with the argument sets,
for instance:


.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    @pytest.mark.parametrize("n,expected", [(1, 2), (3, 4)])
    class TestClass:
        def test_simple_case(self, n, expected):
            assert n + 1 == expected

        def test_weird_simple_case(self, n, expected):
            assert (n * 1) + 1 == expected


To parametrize all tests in a module, you can assign to the :globalvar:`pytestmark` global variable:


.. code-block:: python

    import pytest

    pytestmark = pytest.mark.parametrize("n,expected", [(1, 2), (3, 4)])


    class TestClass:
        def test_simple_case(self, n, expected):
            assert n + 1 == expected

        def test_weird_simple_case(self, n, expected):
            assert (n * 1) + 1 == expected


It is also possible to mark individual test instances within parametrize,
for example with the builtin ``mark.xfail``:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_expectation.py
    import pytest


    @pytest.mark.parametrize(
        "test_input,expected",
        [("3+5", 8), ("2+4", 6), pytest.param("6*9", 42, marks=pytest.mark.xfail)],
    )
    def test_eval(test_input, expected):
        assert eval(test_input) == expected

Let's run this:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 3 items

    test_expectation.py ..x                                              [100%]

    ======================= 2 passed, 1 xfailed in 0.12s =======================

The one parameter set which caused a failure previously now
shows up as an "xfailed" (expected to fail) test.

In case the values provided to ``parametrize`` result in an empty list - for
example, if they're dynamically generated by some function - the behaviour of
pytest is defined by the :confval:`empty_parameter_set_mark` option.

To get all combinations of multiple parametrized arguments you can stack
``parametrize`` decorators:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    @pytest.mark.parametrize("x", [0, 1])
    @pytest.mark.parametrize("y", [2, 3])
    def test_foo(x, y):
        pass

This will run the test with the arguments set to ``x=0/y=2``, ``x=1/y=2``,
``x=0/y=3``, and ``x=1/y=3`` exhausting parameters in the order of the decorators.

.. _`pytest_generate_tests`:

Basic ``pytest_generate_tests`` example
---------------------------------------------

Sometimes you may want to implement your own parametrization scheme
or implement some dynamism for determining the parameters or scope
of a fixture.   For this, you can use the ``pytest_generate_tests`` hook
which is called when collecting a test function.  Through the passed in
``metafunc`` object you can inspect the requesting test context and, most
importantly, you can call ``metafunc.parametrize()`` to cause
parametrization.

For example, let's say we want to run a test taking string inputs which
we want to set via a new ``pytest`` command line option.  Let's first write
a simple test accepting a ``stringinput`` fixture function argument:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_strings.py


    def test_valid_string(stringinput):
        assert stringinput.isalpha()

Now we add a ``conftest.py`` file containing the addition of a
command line option and the parametrization of our test function:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py


    def pytest_addoption(parser):
        parser.addoption(
            "--stringinput",
            action="append",
            default=[],
            help="list of stringinputs to pass to test functions",
        )


    def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):
        if "stringinput" in metafunc.fixturenames:
            metafunc.parametrize("stringinput", metafunc.config.getoption("stringinput"))

If we now pass two stringinput values, our test will run twice:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q --stringinput="hello" --stringinput="world" test_strings.py
    ..                                                                   [100%]
    2 passed in 0.12s

Let's also run with a stringinput that will lead to a failing test:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q --stringinput="!" test_strings.py
    F                                                                    [100%]
    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    ___________________________ test_valid_string[!] ___________________________

    stringinput = '!'

        def test_valid_string(stringinput):
    >       assert stringinput.isalpha()
    E       AssertionError: assert False
    E        +  where False = <built-in method isalpha of str object at 0xdeadbeef0001>()
    E        +    where <built-in method isalpha of str object at 0xdeadbeef0001> = '!'.isalpha

    test_strings.py:4: AssertionError
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_strings.py::test_valid_string[!] - AssertionError: assert False
    1 failed in 0.12s

As expected our test function fails.

If you don't specify a stringinput it will be skipped because
``metafunc.parametrize()`` will be called with an empty parameter
list:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q -rs test_strings.py
    s                                                                    [100%]
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    SKIPPED [1] test_strings.py: got empty parameter set for (stringinput)
    1 skipped in 0.12s

Note that when calling ``metafunc.parametrize`` multiple times with different parameter sets, all parameter names across
those sets cannot be duplicated, otherwise an error will be raised.

How to install and use plugins
===============================

This section talks about installing and using third party plugins.
For writing your own plugins, please refer to :ref:`writing-plugins`.

Installing a third party plugin can be easily done with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pytest-NAME
    pip uninstall pytest-NAME

If a plugin is installed, ``pytest`` automatically finds and integrates it,
there is no need to activate it.

Here is a little annotated list for some popular plugins:

* :pypi:`pytest-django`: write tests
  for `django <https://docs.djangoproject.com/>`_ apps, using pytest integration.

* :pypi:`pytest-twisted`: write tests
  for `twisted <https://twistedmatrix.com/>`_ apps, starting a reactor and
  processing deferreds from test functions.

* :pypi:`pytest-cov`:
  coverage reporting, compatible with distributed testing

* :pypi:`pytest-xdist`:
  to distribute tests to CPUs and remote hosts, to run in boxed
  mode which allows to survive segmentation faults, to run in
  looponfailing mode, automatically re-running failing tests
  on file changes.

* :pypi:`pytest-instafail`:
  to report failures while the test run is happening.

* :pypi:`pytest-bdd`:
  to write tests using behaviour-driven testing.

* :pypi:`pytest-timeout`:
  to timeout tests based on function marks or global definitions.

* :pypi:`pytest-pep8`:
  a ``--pep8`` option to enable PEP8 compliance checking.

* :pypi:`pytest-flakes`:
  check source code with pyflakes.

* :pypi:`allure-pytest`:
  report test results via `allure-framework <https://github.com/allure-framework/>`_.

To see a complete list of all plugins with their latest testing
status against different pytest and Python versions, please visit

.. _`available installable plugins`:

Requiring/Loading plugins in a test module or conftest file
-----------------------------------------------------------

You can require plugins in a test module or a conftest file using :globalvar:`pytest_plugins`:

.. code-block:: python

    pytest_plugins = ("myapp.testsupport.myplugin",)

When the test module or conftest plugin is loaded the specified plugins
will be loaded as well.

.. note::

    Requiring plugins using a ``pytest_plugins`` variable in non-root
    ``conftest.py`` files is deprecated. See
    :ref:`full explanation <requiring plugins in non-root conftests>`
    in the Writing plugins section.

.. note::
   The name ``pytest_plugins`` is reserved and should not be used as a
   name for a custom plugin module.


.. _`findpluginname`:

Finding out which plugins are active
------------------------------------

If you want to find out which plugins are active in your
environment you can type:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --trace-config

and will get an extended test header which shows activated plugins
and their names. It will also print local plugins aka
:ref:`conftest.py <conftest.py plugins>` files when they are loaded.

.. _`cmdunregister`:

Deactivating / unregistering a plugin by name
---------------------------------------------

You can prevent plugins from loading or unregister them:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -p no:NAME

This means that any subsequent try to activate/load the named
plugin will not work.

If you want to unconditionally disable a plugin for a project, you can add
this option to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

.. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      addopts = -p no:NAME

Alternatively to disable it only in certain environments (for example in a
CI server), you can set ``PYTEST_ADDOPTS`` environment variable to
``-p no:name``.

See :ref:`findpluginname` for how to obtain the name of a plugin.

.. _`disable_plugin_autoload`:

Disabling plugins from autoloading
----------------------------------

If you want to disable plugins from loading automatically, instead of requiring you to
manually specify each plugin with ``-p`` or :envvar:`PYTEST_PLUGINS`, you can use ``--disable-plugin-autoload`` or :envvar:`PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD`.

.. code-block:: bash

   export PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1
   export PYTEST_PLUGINS=NAME,NAME2
   pytest

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest --disable-plugin-autoload -p NAME,NAME2

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    addopts =

## File: doc/en/how-to/skipping.rst
````
.. _`skip and xfail`:

.. _skipping:

How to use skip and xfail to deal with tests that cannot succeed
=================================================================

You can mark test functions that cannot be run on certain platforms
or that you expect to fail so pytest can deal with them accordingly and
present a summary of the test session, while keeping the test suite *green*.

A **skip** means that you expect your test to pass only if some conditions are met,
otherwise pytest should skip running the test altogether. Common examples are skipping
windows-only tests on non-windows platforms, or skipping tests that depend on an external
resource which is not available at the moment (for example a database).

An **xfail** means that you expect a test to fail for some reason.
A common example is a test for a feature not yet implemented, or a bug not yet fixed.
When a test passes despite being expected to fail (marked with ``pytest.mark.xfail``),
it's an **xpass** and will be reported in the test summary.

``pytest`` counts and lists *skip* and *xfail* tests separately. Detailed
information about skipped/xfailed tests is not shown by default to avoid
cluttering the output.  You can use the ``-r`` option to see details
corresponding to the "short" letters shown in the test progress:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -rxXs  # show extra info on xfailed, xpassed, and skipped tests

More details on the ``-r`` option can be found by running ``pytest -h``.

(See :ref:`how to change command line options defaults`)

.. _skipif:
.. _skip:
.. _`condition booleans`:

Skipping test functions
-----------------------



The simplest way to skip a test function is to mark it with the ``skip`` decorator
which may be passed an optional ``reason``:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.skip(reason="no way of currently testing this")
    def test_the_unknown(): ...


Alternatively, it is also possible to skip imperatively during test execution or setup
by calling the ``pytest.skip(reason)`` function:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_function():
        if not valid_config():
            pytest.skip("unsupported configuration")

The imperative method is useful when it is not possible to evaluate the skip condition
during import time.

It is also possible to skip the whole module using
``pytest.skip(reason, allow_module_level=True)`` at the module level:

.. code-block:: python

    import sys

    import pytest

    if not sys.platform.startswith("win"):
        pytest.skip("skipping windows-only tests", allow_module_level=True)


**Reference**: :ref:`pytest.mark.skip ref`

``skipif``
~~~~~~~~~~



If you wish to skip something conditionally then you can use ``skipif`` instead.
Here is an example of marking a test function to be skipped
when run on an interpreter earlier than Python3.10:

.. code-block:: python

    import sys


    @pytest.mark.skipif(sys.version_info < (3, 10), reason="requires python3.10 or higher")
    def test_function(): ...

If the condition evaluates to ``True`` during collection, the test function will be skipped,
with the specified reason appearing in the summary when using ``-rs``.

You can share ``skipif`` markers between modules.  Consider this test module:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_mymodule.py
    import mymodule

    minversion = pytest.mark.skipif(
        mymodule.__versioninfo__ < (1, 1), reason="at least mymodule-1.1 required"
    )


    @minversion
    def test_function(): ...

You can import the marker and reuse it in another test module:

.. code-block:: python

    # test_myothermodule.py
    from test_mymodule import minversion


    @minversion
    def test_anotherfunction(): ...

For larger test suites it's usually a good idea to have one file
where you define the markers which you then consistently apply
throughout your test suite.

Alternatively, you can use :ref:`condition strings
<string conditions>` instead of booleans, but they can't be shared between modules easily
so they are supported mainly for backward compatibility reasons.

**Reference**: :ref:`pytest.mark.skipif ref`


Skip all test functions of a class or module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``skipif`` marker (as any other marker) on classes:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.skipif(sys.platform == "win32", reason="does not run on windows")
    class TestPosixCalls:
        def test_function(self):
            "will not be setup or run under 'win32' platform"

If the condition is ``True``, this marker will produce a skip result for
each of the test methods of that class.

If you want to skip all test functions of a module, you may use the
:globalvar:`pytestmark` global:

.. code-block:: python

    # test_module.py
    pytestmark = pytest.mark.skipif(...)

If multiple ``skipif`` decorators are applied to a test function, it
will be skipped if any of the skip conditions is true.

.. _`whole class- or module level`: mark.html#scoped-marking


Skipping files or directories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you may need to skip an entire file or directory, for example if the
tests rely on Python version-specific features or contain code that you do not
wish pytest to run. In this case, you must exclude the files and directories
from collection. Refer to :ref:`customizing-test-collection` for more
information.


Skipping on a missing import dependency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can skip tests on a missing import by using :ref:`pytest.importorskip ref`
at module level, within a test, or test setup function.

.. code-block:: python

    docutils = pytest.importorskip("docutils")

If ``docutils`` cannot be imported here, this will lead to a skip outcome of
the test. You can also skip based on the version number of a library:

.. code-block:: python

    docutils = pytest.importorskip("docutils", minversion="0.3")

The version will be read from the specified
module's ``__version__`` attribute.

Summary
~~~~~~~

Here's a quick guide on how to skip tests in a module in different situations:

1. Skip all tests in a module unconditionally:

  .. code-block:: python

        pytestmark = pytest.mark.skip("all tests still WIP")

2. Skip all tests in a module based on some condition:

  .. code-block:: python

        pytestmark = pytest.mark.skipif(sys.platform == "win32", reason="tests for linux only")

3. Skip all tests in a module if some import is missing:

  .. code-block:: python

        pexpect = pytest.importorskip("pexpect")


.. _xfail:

XFail: mark test functions as expected to fail
----------------------------------------------

You can use the ``xfail`` marker to indicate that you
expect a test to fail:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.xfail
    def test_function(): ...

This test will run but no traceback will be reported when it fails. Instead, terminal
reporting will list it in the "expected to fail" (``XFAIL``) or "unexpectedly
passing" (``XPASS``) sections.

Alternatively, you can also mark a test as ``XFAIL`` from within the test or its setup function
imperatively:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_function():
        if not valid_config():
            pytest.xfail("failing configuration (but should work)")

.. code-block:: python

    def test_function2():
        import slow_module

        if slow_module.slow_function():
            pytest.xfail("slow_module taking too long")

These two examples illustrate situations where you don't want to check for a condition
at the module level, which is when a condition would otherwise be evaluated for marks.

This will make ``test_function`` ``XFAIL``. Note that no other code is executed after
the :func:`pytest.xfail` call, differently from the marker. That's because it is implemented
internally by raising a known exception.

**Reference**: :ref:`pytest.mark.xfail ref`


``condition`` parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a test is only expected to fail under a certain condition, you can pass
that condition as the first parameter:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.xfail(sys.platform == "win32", reason="bug in a 3rd party library")
    def test_function(): ...

Note that you have to pass a reason as well (see the parameter description at
:ref:`pytest.mark.xfail ref`).

``reason`` parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify the motive of an expected failure with the ``reason`` parameter:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.xfail(reason="known parser issue")
    def test_function(): ...


``raises`` parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to be more specific as to why the test is failing, you can specify
a single exception, or a tuple of exceptions, in the ``raises`` argument.

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.xfail(raises=RuntimeError)
    def test_function(): ...

Then the test will be reported as a regular failure if it fails with an
exception not mentioned in ``raises``.

``run`` parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a test should be marked as xfail and reported as such but should not be
even executed, use the ``run`` parameter as ``False``:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.xfail(run=False)
    def test_function(): ...

This is specially useful for xfailing tests that are crashing the interpreter and should be
investigated later.

.. _`xfail strict tutorial`:

``strict`` parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both ``XFAIL`` and ``XPASS`` don't fail the test suite by default.
You can change this by setting the ``strict`` keyword-only parameter to ``True``:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True)
    def test_function(): ...


This will make ``XPASS`` ("unexpectedly passing") results from this test to fail the test suite.

You can change the default value of the ``strict`` parameter using the
``xfail_strict`` ini option:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    xfail_strict=true


Ignoring xfail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By specifying on the commandline:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --runxfail

you can force the running and reporting of an ``xfail`` marked test
as if it weren't marked at all. This also causes :func:`pytest.xfail` to produce no effect.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Here is a simple test file with the several usages:

.. literalinclude:: /example/xfail_demo.py

Running it with the report-on-xfail option gives this output:

It is possible to apply markers like skip and xfail to individual
test instances when using parametrize:

.. _`tmp_path handling`:
.. _tmp_path:

How to use temporary directories and files in tests
===================================================

The ``tmp_path`` fixture
------------------------

You can use the ``tmp_path`` fixture which will provide a temporary directory
unique to each test function.

``tmp_path`` is a :class:`pathlib.Path` object. Here is an example test usage:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_tmp_path.py
    CONTENT = "content"


    def test_create_file(tmp_path):
        d = tmp_path / "sub"
        d.mkdir()
        p = d / "hello.txt"
        p.write_text(CONTENT, encoding="utf-8")
        assert p.read_text(encoding="utf-8") == CONTENT
        assert len(list(tmp_path.iterdir())) == 1
        assert 0

Running this would result in a passed test except for the last
``assert 0`` line which we use to look at values:

By default, ``pytest`` retains the temporary directory for the last 3 ``pytest``
invocations. Concurrent invocations of the same test function are supported by
configuring the base temporary directory to be unique for each concurrent
run. See `temporary directory location and retention`_ for details.

.. _`tmp_path_factory example`:

The ``tmp_path_factory`` fixture
--------------------------------

The ``tmp_path_factory`` is a session-scoped fixture which can be used
to create arbitrary temporary directories from any other fixture or test.

For example, suppose your test suite needs a large image on disk, which is
generated procedurally. Instead of computing the same image for each test
that uses it into its own ``tmp_path``, you can generate it once per-session
to save time:

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of conftest.py
    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
    def image_file(tmp_path_factory):
        img = compute_expensive_image()
        fn = tmp_path_factory.mktemp("data") / "img.png"
        img.save(fn)
        return fn


    # contents of test_image.py
    def test_histogram(image_file):
        img = load_image(image_file)
        # compute and test histogram

See :ref:`tmp_path_factory API <tmp_path_factory factory api>` for details.

.. _`tmpdir and tmpdir_factory`:
.. _tmpdir:

The ``tmpdir`` and ``tmpdir_factory`` fixtures
----------------------------------------------

The ``tmpdir`` and ``tmpdir_factory`` fixtures are similar to ``tmp_path``
and ``tmp_path_factory``, but use/return legacy `py.path.local`_ objects
rather than standard :class:`pathlib.Path` objects.

.. note::
    These days, it is preferred to use ``tmp_path`` and ``tmp_path_factory``.

    In order to help modernize old code bases, one can run pytest with the legacypath
    plugin disabled:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pytest -p no:legacypath

    This will trigger errors on tests using the legacy paths.
    It can also be permanently set as part of the :confval:`addopts` parameter in the
    config file.

See :fixture:`tmpdir <tmpdir>` :fixture:`tmpdir_factory <tmpdir_factory>`
API for details.


.. _`temporary directory location and retention`:

Temporary directory location and retention
------------------------------------------

The temporary directories,
as returned by the :fixture:`tmp_path` and (now deprecated) :fixture:`tmpdir` fixtures,
are automatically created under a base temporary directory,
in a structure that depends on the ``--basetemp`` option:

- By default (when the ``--basetemp`` option is not set),
  the temporary directories will follow this template:

  .. code-block:: text

      {temproot}/pytest-of-{user}/pytest-{num}/{testname}/

  where:

  - ``{temproot}`` is the system temporary directory
    as determined by :py:func:`tempfile.gettempdir`.
    It can be overridden by the :envvar:`PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT` environment variable.
  - ``{user}`` is the user name running the tests,
  - ``{num}`` is a number that is incremented with each test suite run
  - ``{testname}`` is a sanitized version of :py:attr:`the name of the current test <_pytest.nodes.Node.name>`.

  The auto-incrementing ``{num}`` placeholder provides a basic retention feature
  and avoids that existing results of previous test runs are blindly removed.
  By default, the last 3 temporary directories are kept,
  but this behavior can be configured with
  :confval:`tmp_path_retention_count` and :confval:`tmp_path_retention_policy`.

- When the ``--basetemp`` option is used (e.g. ``pytest --basetemp=mydir``),
  it will be used directly as base temporary directory:

  .. code-block:: text

      {basetemp}/{testname}/

  Note that there is no retention feature in this case:
  only the results of the most recent run will be kept.

  .. warning::

      The directory given to ``--basetemp`` will be cleared blindly before each test run,
      so make sure to use a directory for that purpose only.

When distributing tests on the local machine using ``pytest-xdist``, care is taken to
automatically configure a `basetemp` directory for the sub processes such that all temporary
data lands below a single per-test run temporary directory.

.. _`unittest.TestCase`:
.. _`unittest`:

How to use ``unittest``-based tests with pytest
===============================================

``pytest`` supports running Python ``unittest``-based tests out of the box.
It's meant for leveraging existing ``unittest``-based test suites
to use pytest as a test runner and also allow to incrementally adapt
the test suite to take full advantage of pytest's features.

To run an existing ``unittest``-style test suite using ``pytest``, type:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest tests


pytest will automatically collect ``unittest.TestCase`` subclasses and
their ``test`` methods in ``test_*.py`` or ``*_test.py`` files.

Almost all ``unittest`` features are supported:

* ``@unittest.skip`` style decorators;
* ``setUp/tearDown``;
* ``setUpClass/tearDownClass``;
* ``setUpModule/tearDownModule``;

.. _`pytest-subtests`: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-subtests
.. _`load_tests protocol`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#load-tests-protocol

Additionally, :ref:`subtests <python:subtests>` are supported by the
`pytest-subtests`_ plugin.

Up to this point pytest does not have support for the following features:

* `load_tests protocol`_;

Benefits out of the box
-----------------------

By running your test suite with pytest you can make use of several features,
in most cases without having to modify existing code:

* Obtain :ref:`more informative tracebacks <tbreportdemo>`;
* :ref:`stdout and stderr <captures>` capturing;
* :ref:`Test selection options <select-tests>` using ``-k`` and ``-m`` flags;
* :ref:`maxfail`;
* :ref:`--pdb <pdb-option>` command-line option for debugging on test failures
  (see :ref:`note <pdb-unittest-note>` below);
* Distribute tests to multiple CPUs using the :pypi:`pytest-xdist` plugin;
* Use :ref:`plain assert-statements <assert>` instead of ``self.assert*`` functions
  (:pypi:`unittest2pytest` is immensely helpful in this);


pytest features in ``unittest.TestCase`` subclasses
---------------------------------------------------

The following pytest features work in ``unittest.TestCase`` subclasses:

* :ref:`Marks <mark>`: :ref:`skip <skip>`, :ref:`skipif <skipif>`, :ref:`xfail <xfail>`;
* :ref:`Auto-use fixtures <mixing-fixtures>`;

The following pytest features **do not** work, and probably
never will due to different design philosophies:

* :ref:`Fixtures <fixture>` (except for ``autouse`` fixtures, see :ref:`below <mixing-fixtures>`);
* :ref:`Parametrization <parametrize>`;
* :ref:`Custom hooks <writing-plugins>`;


Third party plugins may or may not work well, depending on the plugin and the test suite.

.. _mixing-fixtures:

Mixing pytest fixtures into ``unittest.TestCase`` subclasses using marks
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running your unittest with ``pytest`` allows you to use its
:ref:`fixture mechanism <fixture>` with ``unittest.TestCase`` style
tests.  Assuming you have at least skimmed the pytest fixture features,
let's jump-start into an example that integrates a pytest ``db_class``
fixture, setting up a class-cached database object, and then reference
it from a unittest-style test:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py

    # we define a fixture function below and it will be "used" by
    # referencing its name from tests

    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture(scope="class")
    def db_class(request):
        class DummyDB:
            pass

        # set a class attribute on the invoking test context
        request.cls.db = DummyDB()

This defines a fixture function ``db_class`` which - if used - is
called once for each test class and which sets the class-level
``db`` attribute to a ``DummyDB`` instance.  The fixture function
achieves this by receiving a special ``request`` object which gives
access to :ref:`the requesting test context <request-context>` such
as the ``cls`` attribute, denoting the class from which the fixture
is used.  This architecture de-couples fixture writing from actual test
code and allows reuse of the fixture by a minimal reference, the fixture
name.  So let's write an actual ``unittest.TestCase`` class using our
fixture definition:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_unittest_db.py

    import unittest

    import pytest


    @pytest.mark.usefixtures("db_class")
    class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_method1(self):
            assert hasattr(self, "db")
            assert 0, self.db  # fail for demo purposes

        def test_method2(self):
            assert 0, self.db  # fail for demo purposes

The ``@pytest.mark.usefixtures("db_class")`` class-decorator makes sure that
the pytest fixture function ``db_class`` is called once per class.
Due to the deliberately failing assert statements, we can take a look at
the ``self.db`` values in the traceback:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest test_unittest_db.py

    ============================ 2 failed in 0.12s =============================

This default pytest traceback shows that the two test methods
share the same ``self.db`` instance which was our intention
when writing the class-scoped fixture function above.


Using autouse fixtures and accessing other fixtures
---------------------------------------------------

Although it's usually better to explicitly declare use of fixtures you need
for a given test, you may sometimes want to have fixtures that are
automatically used in a given context.  After all, the traditional
style of unittest-setup mandates the use of this implicit fixture writing
and chances are, you are used to it or like it.

You can flag fixture functions with ``@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)``
and define the fixture function in the context where you want it used.
Let's look at an ``initdir`` fixture which makes all test methods of a
``TestCase`` class execute in a temporary directory with a
pre-initialized ``samplefile.ini``.  Our ``initdir`` fixture itself uses
the pytest builtin :fixture:`tmp_path` fixture to delegate the
creation of a per-test temporary directory:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_unittest_cleandir.py
    import unittest

    import pytest


    class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
        @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
        def initdir(self, tmp_path, monkeypatch):
            monkeypatch.chdir(tmp_path)  # change to pytest-provided temporary directory
            tmp_path.joinpath("samplefile.ini").write_text("# testdata", encoding="utf-8")

        def test_method(self):
            with open("samplefile.ini", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                s = f.read()
            assert "testdata" in s

Due to the ``autouse`` flag the ``initdir`` fixture function will be
used for all methods of the class where it is defined.  This is a
shortcut for using a ``@pytest.mark.usefixtures("initdir")`` marker
on the class like in the previous example.

Running this test module ...:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q test_unittest_cleandir.py
    .                                                                    [100%]
    1 passed in 0.12s

... gives us one passed test because the ``initdir`` fixture function
was executed ahead of the ``test_method``.

.. note::

   ``unittest.TestCase`` methods cannot directly receive fixture
   arguments as implementing that is likely to inflict
   on the ability to run general unittest.TestCase test suites.

   The above ``usefixtures`` and ``autouse`` examples should help to mix in
   pytest fixtures into unittest suites.

   You can also gradually move away from subclassing from ``unittest.TestCase`` to *plain asserts*
   and then start to benefit from the full pytest feature set step by step.

.. _pdb-unittest-note:

.. note::

    Due to architectural differences between the two frameworks, setup and
    teardown for ``unittest``-based tests is performed during the ``call`` phase
    of testing instead of in ``pytest``'s standard ``setup`` and ``teardown``
    stages. This can be important to understand in some situations, particularly
    when reasoning about errors. For example, if a ``unittest``-based suite
    exhibits errors during setup, ``pytest`` will report no errors during its
    ``setup`` phase and will instead raise the error during ``call``.

.. _usage:

How to invoke pytest
==========================================

..  seealso:: :ref:`Complete pytest command-line flag reference <command-line-flags>`

In general, pytest is invoked with the command ``pytest`` (see below for :ref:`other ways to invoke pytest
<invoke-other>`). This will execute all tests in all files whose names follow the form ``test_*.py`` or ``\*_test.py``
in the current directory and its subdirectories. More generally, pytest follows :ref:`standard test discovery rules
<test discovery>`.


.. _select-tests:

Specifying which tests to run
------------------------------

Pytest supports several ways to run and select tests from the command-line or from a file
(see below for :ref:`reading arguments from file <args-from-file>`).

**Run tests in a module**

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest test_mod.py

**Run tests in a directory**

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest testing/

**Run tests by keyword expressions**

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -k 'MyClass and not method'

This will run tests which contain names that match the given *string expression* (case-insensitive),
which can include Python operators that use filenames, class names and function names as variables.
The example above will run ``TestMyClass.test_something``  but not ``TestMyClass.test_method_simple``.
Use ``""`` instead of ``''`` in expression when running this on Windows

.. _nodeids:

**Run tests by collection arguments**

Pass the module filename relative to the working directory, followed by specifiers like the class name and function name
separated by ``::`` characters, and parameters from parameterization enclosed in ``[]``.

To run a specific test within a module:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest tests/test_mod.py::test_func

To run all tests in a class:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest tests/test_mod.py::TestClass

Specifying a specific test method:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest tests/test_mod.py::TestClass::test_method

Specifying a specific parametrization of a test:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest tests/test_mod.py::test_func[x1,y2]

**Run tests by marker expressions**

To run all tests which are decorated with the ``@pytest.mark.slow`` decorator:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -m slow


To run all tests which are decorated with the annotated ``@pytest.mark.slow(phase=1)`` decorator,
with the ``phase`` keyword argument set to ``1``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -m "slow(phase=1)"

For more information see :ref:`marks <mark>`.

**Run tests from packages**

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --pyargs pkg.testing

This will import ``pkg.testing`` and use its filesystem location to find and run tests from.

.. _args-from-file:

**Read arguments from file**

.. versionadded:: 8.2

All of the above can be read from a file using the ``@`` prefix:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest @tests_to_run.txt

where ``tests_to_run.txt`` contains an entry per line, e.g.:

.. code-block:: text

    tests/test_file.py
    tests/test_mod.py::test_func[x1,y2]
    tests/test_mod.py::TestClass
    -m slow

This file can also be generated using ``pytest --collect-only -q`` and modified as needed.

Getting help on version, option names, environment variables
--------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --version   # shows where pytest was imported from
    pytest --fixtures  # show available builtin function arguments
    pytest -h | --help # show help on command line and config file options


.. _durations:

Profiling test execution duration
-------------------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 6.0

To get a list of the slowest 10 test durations over 1.0s long:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --durations=10 --durations-min=1.0

By default, pytest will not show test durations that are too small (<0.005s) unless ``-vv`` is passed on the command-line.


Managing loading of plugins
-------------------------------

Early loading plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can early-load plugins (internal and external) explicitly in the command-line with the ``-p`` option::

    pytest -p mypluginmodule

The option receives a ``name`` parameter, which can be:

* A full module dotted name, for example ``myproject.plugins``. This dotted name must be importable.
* The entry-point name of a plugin. This is the name passed to ``importlib`` when the plugin is
  registered. For example to early-load the :pypi:`pytest-cov` plugin you can use::

    pytest -p pytest_cov


Disabling plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To disable loading specific plugins at invocation time, use the ``-p`` option
together with the prefix ``no:``.

Example: to disable loading the plugin ``doctest``, which is responsible for
executing doctest tests from text files, invoke pytest like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -p no:doctest


.. _invoke-other:

Other ways of calling pytest
-----------------------------------------------------

.. _invoke-python:

Calling pytest through ``python -m pytest``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can invoke testing through the Python interpreter from the command line:

.. code-block:: text

    python -m pytest [...]

This is almost equivalent to invoking the command line script ``pytest [...]``
directly, except that calling via ``python`` will also add the current directory to ``sys.path``.


.. _`pytest.main-usage`:

Calling pytest from Python code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can invoke ``pytest`` from Python code directly:

.. code-block:: python

    retcode = pytest.main()

this acts as if you would call "pytest" from the command line.
It will not raise :class:`SystemExit` but return the :ref:`exit code <exit-codes>` instead.
If you don't pass it any arguments, ``main`` reads the arguments from the command line arguments of the process (:data:`sys.argv`), which may be undesirable.
You can pass in options and arguments explicitly:

.. code-block:: python

    retcode = pytest.main(["-x", "mytestdir"])

You can specify additional plugins to ``pytest.main``:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of myinvoke.py
    import sys

    import pytest


    class MyPlugin:
        def pytest_sessionfinish(self):
            print("*** test run reporting finishing")


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        sys.exit(pytest.main(["-qq"], plugins=[MyPlugin()]))

Running it will show that ``MyPlugin`` was added and its
hook was invoked:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ python myinvoke.py
    *** test run reporting finishing


.. note::

    Calling ``pytest.main()`` will result in importing your tests and any modules
    that they import. Due to the caching mechanism of python's import system,
    making subsequent calls to ``pytest.main()`` from the same process will not
    reflect changes to those files between the calls. For this reason, making
    multiple calls to ``pytest.main()`` from the same process (in order to re-run
    tests, for example) is not recommended.

````
.. _`writinghooks`:

Writing hook functions
======================


.. _validation:

hook function validation and execution
--------------------------------------

pytest calls hook functions from registered plugins for any
given hook specification.  Let's look at a typical hook function
for the ``pytest_collection_modifyitems(session, config,
items)`` hook which pytest calls after collection of all test items is
completed.

When we implement a ``pytest_collection_modifyitems`` function in our plugin
pytest will during registration verify that you use argument
names which match the specification and bail out if not.

Let's look at a possible implementation:

.. code-block:: python

    def pytest_collection_modifyitems(config, items):
        # called after collection is completed
        # you can modify the ``items`` list
        ...

Here, ``pytest`` will pass in ``config`` (the pytest config object)
and ``items`` (the list of collected test items) but will not pass
in the ``session`` argument because we didn't list it in the function
signature.  This dynamic "pruning" of arguments allows ``pytest`` to
be "future-compatible": we can introduce new hook named parameters without
breaking the signatures of existing hook implementations.  It is one of
the reasons for the general long-lived compatibility of pytest plugins.

Note that hook functions other than ``pytest_runtest_*`` are not
allowed to raise exceptions.  Doing so will break the pytest run.



.. _firstresult:

firstresult: stop at first non-None result
-------------------------------------------

Most calls to ``pytest`` hooks result in a **list of results** which contains
all non-None results of the called hook functions.

Some hook specifications use the ``firstresult=True`` option so that the hook
call only executes until the first of N registered functions returns a
non-None result which is then taken as result of the overall hook call.
The remaining hook functions will not be called in this case.

.. _`hookwrapper`:

hook wrappers: executing around other hooks
-------------------------------------------------

pytest plugins can implement hook wrappers which wrap the execution
of other hook implementations.  A hook wrapper is a generator function
which yields exactly once. When pytest invokes hooks it first executes
hook wrappers and passes the same arguments as to the regular hooks.

At the yield point of the hook wrapper pytest will execute the next hook
implementations and return their result to the yield point, or will
propagate an exception if they raised.

Here is an example definition of a hook wrapper:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    @pytest.hookimpl(wrapper=True)
    def pytest_pyfunc_call(pyfuncitem):
        do_something_before_next_hook_executes()

        # If the outcome is an exception, will raise the exception.
        res = yield

        new_res = post_process_result(res)

        # Override the return value to the plugin system.
        return new_res

The hook wrapper needs to return a result for the hook, or raise an exception.

In many cases, the wrapper only needs to perform tracing or other side effects
around the actual hook implementations, in which case it can return the result
value of the ``yield``. The simplest (though useless) hook wrapper is
``return (yield)``.

In other cases, the wrapper wants the adjust or adapt the result, in which case
it can return a new value. If the result of the underlying hook is a mutable
object, the wrapper may modify that result, but it's probably better to avoid it.

If the hook implementation failed with an exception, the wrapper can handle that
exception using a ``try-catch-finally`` around the ``yield``, by propagating it,
suppressing it, or raising a different exception entirely.

For more information, consult the
:ref:`pluggy documentation about hook wrappers <pluggy:hookwrappers>`.

.. _plugin-hookorder:

Hook function ordering / call example
-------------------------------------

For any given hook specification there may be more than one
implementation and we thus generally view ``hook`` execution as a
``1:N`` function call where ``N`` is the number of registered functions.
There are ways to influence if a hook implementation comes before or
after others, i.e.  the position in the ``N``-sized list of functions:

.. code-block:: python

    # Plugin 1
    @pytest.hookimpl(tryfirst=True)
    def pytest_collection_modifyitems(items):
        # will execute as early as possible
        ...


    # Plugin 2
    @pytest.hookimpl(trylast=True)
    def pytest_collection_modifyitems(items):
        # will execute as late as possible
        ...


    # Plugin 3
    @pytest.hookimpl(wrapper=True)
    def pytest_collection_modifyitems(items):
        # will execute even before the tryfirst one above!
        try:
            return (yield)
        finally:
            # will execute after all non-wrappers executed
            ...

Here is the order of execution:

1. Plugin3's pytest_collection_modifyitems called until the yield point
   because it is a hook wrapper.

2. Plugin1's pytest_collection_modifyitems is called because it is marked
   with ``tryfirst=True``.

3. Plugin2's pytest_collection_modifyitems is called because it is marked
   with ``trylast=True`` (but even without this mark it would come after
   Plugin1).

4. Plugin3's pytest_collection_modifyitems then executing the code after the yield
   point.  The yield receives the result from calling the non-wrappers, or raises
   an exception if the non-wrappers raised.

It's possible to use ``tryfirst`` and ``trylast`` also on hook wrappers
in which case it will influence the ordering of hook wrappers among each other.

.. _`declaringhooks`:

Declaring new hooks
------------------------

.. note::

    This is a quick overview on how to add new hooks and how they work in general, but a more complete
    overview can be found in `the pluggy documentation <https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

Plugins and ``conftest.py`` files may declare new hooks that can then be
implemented by other plugins in order to alter behaviour or interact with
the new plugin:

.. autofunction:: _pytest.hookspec.pytest_addhooks
    :noindex:

Hooks are usually declared as do-nothing functions that contain only
documentation describing when the hook will be called and what return values
are expected. The names of the functions must start with `pytest_` otherwise pytest won't recognize them.

Here's an example. Let's assume this code is in the ``sample_hook.py`` module.

.. code-block:: python

    def pytest_my_hook(config):
        """
        Receives the pytest config and does things with it
        """

To register the hooks with pytest they need to be structured in their own module or class. This
class or module can then be passed to the ``pluginmanager`` using the ``pytest_addhooks`` function
(which itself is a hook exposed by pytest).

.. code-block:: python

    def pytest_addhooks(pluginmanager):
        """This example assumes the hooks are grouped in the 'sample_hook' module."""
        from my_app.tests import sample_hook

        pluginmanager.add_hookspecs(sample_hook)

For a real world example, see `newhooks.py`_ from `xdist <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist>`_.

.. _`newhooks.py`: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/blob/974bd566c599dc6a9ea291838c6f226197208b46/xdist/newhooks.py

Hooks may be called both from fixtures or from other hooks. In both cases, hooks are called
through the ``hook`` object, available in the ``config`` object. Most hooks receive a
``config`` object directly, while fixtures may use the ``pytestconfig`` fixture which provides the same object.

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture()
    def my_fixture(pytestconfig):
        # call the hook called "pytest_my_hook"
        # 'result' will be a list of return values from all registered functions.
        result = pytestconfig.hook.pytest_my_hook(config=pytestconfig)

.. note::
    Hooks receive parameters using only keyword arguments.

Now your hook is ready to be used. To register a function at the hook, other plugins or users must
now simply define the function ``pytest_my_hook`` with the correct signature in their ``conftest.py``.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    def pytest_my_hook(config):
        """
        Print all active hooks to the screen.
        """
        print(config.hook)


.. _`addoptionhooks`:


Using hooks in pytest_addoption
-------------------------------

Occasionally, it is necessary to change the way in which command line options
are defined by one plugin based on hooks in another plugin. For example,
a plugin may expose a command line option for which another plugin needs
to define the default value. The pluginmanager can be used to install and
use hooks to accomplish this. The plugin would define and add the hooks
and use pytest_addoption as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   # contents of hooks.py


   # Use firstresult=True because we only want one plugin to define this
   # default value
   @hookspec(firstresult=True)
   def pytest_config_file_default_value():
       """Return the default value for the config file command line option."""


   # contents of myplugin.py


   def pytest_addhooks(pluginmanager):
       """This example assumes the hooks are grouped in the 'hooks' module."""
       from . import hooks

       pluginmanager.add_hookspecs(hooks)


   def pytest_addoption(parser, pluginmanager):
       default_value = pluginmanager.hook.pytest_config_file_default_value()
       parser.addoption(
           "--config-file",
           help="Config file to use, defaults to %(default)s",
           default=default_value,
       )

The conftest.py that is using myplugin would simply define the hook as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    def pytest_config_file_default_value():
        return "config.yaml"


Optionally using hooks from 3rd party plugins
---------------------------------------------

Using new hooks from plugins as explained above might be a little tricky
because of the standard :ref:`validation mechanism <validation>`:
if you depend on a plugin that is not installed, validation will fail and
the error message will not make much sense to your users.

One approach is to defer the hook implementation to a new plugin instead of
declaring the hook functions directly in your plugin module, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of myplugin.py


    class DeferPlugin:
        """Simple plugin to defer pytest-xdist hook functions."""

        def pytest_testnodedown(self, node, error):
            """standard xdist hook function."""


    def pytest_configure(config):
        if config.pluginmanager.hasplugin("xdist"):
            config.pluginmanager.register(DeferPlugin())

This has the added benefit of allowing you to conditionally install hooks
depending on which plugins are installed.

.. _plugin-stash:

Storing data on items across hook functions
-------------------------------------------

Plugins often need to store data on :class:`~pytest.Item`\s in one hook
implementation, and access it in another. One common solution is to just
assign some private attribute directly on the item, but type-checkers like
mypy frown upon this, and it may also cause conflicts with other plugins.
So pytest offers a better way to do this, :attr:`item.stash <_pytest.nodes.Node.stash>`.

To use the "stash" in your plugins, first create "stash keys" somewhere at the
top level of your plugin:

.. code-block:: python

    been_there_key = pytest.StashKey[bool]()
    done_that_key = pytest.StashKey[str]()

then use the keys to stash your data at some point:

.. code-block:: python

    def pytest_runtest_setup(item: pytest.Item) -> None:
        item.stash[been_there_key] = True
        item.stash[done_that_key] = "no"

and retrieve them at another point:

.. code-block:: python

    def pytest_runtest_teardown(item: pytest.Item) -> None:
        if not item.stash[been_there_key]:
            print("Oh?")
        item.stash[done_that_key] = "yes!"

Stashes are available on all node types (like :class:`~pytest.Class`,
:class:`~pytest.Session`) and also on :class:`~pytest.Config`, if needed.

## File: doc/en/how-to/writing_plugins.rst
````
.. _plugins:
.. _`writing-plugins`:

Writing plugins
===============

It is easy to implement `local conftest plugins`_ for your own project
or `pip-installable plugins`_ that can be used throughout many projects,
including third party projects.  Please refer to :ref:`using plugins` if you
only want to use but not write plugins.

A plugin contains one or multiple hook functions. :ref:`Writing hooks <writinghooks>`
explains the basics and details of how you can write a hook function yourself.
``pytest`` implements all aspects of configuration, collection, running and
reporting by calling :ref:`well specified hooks <hook-reference>` of the following plugins:

* builtin plugins: loaded from pytest's internal ``_pytest`` directory.

* :ref:`external plugins <extplugins>`: installed third-party modules discovered
  through :ref:`entry points <pip-installable plugins>` in their packaging metadata

* `conftest.py plugins`_: modules auto-discovered in test directories

In principle, each hook call is a ``1:N`` Python function call where ``N`` is the
number of registered implementation functions for a given specification.
All specifications and implementations follow the ``pytest_`` prefix
naming convention, making them easy to distinguish and find.

.. _`pluginorder`:

Plugin discovery order at tool startup
--------------------------------------

``pytest`` loads plugin modules at tool startup in the following way:

1. by scanning the command line for the ``-p no:name`` option
   and *blocking* that plugin from being loaded (even builtin plugins can
   be blocked this way). This happens before normal command-line parsing.

2. by loading all builtin plugins.

3. by scanning the command line for the ``-p name`` option
   and loading the specified plugin. This happens before normal command-line parsing.

4. by loading all plugins registered through installed third-party package
   :ref:`entry points <pip-installable plugins>`, unless the
   :envvar:`PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD` environment variable is set.

5. by loading all plugins specified through the :envvar:`PYTEST_PLUGINS` environment variable.

6. by loading all "initial ":file:`conftest.py` files:

   - determine the test paths: specified on the command line, otherwise in
     :confval:`testpaths` if defined and running from the rootdir, otherwise the
     current dir
   - for each test path, load ``conftest.py`` and ``test*/conftest.py`` relative
     to the directory part of the test path, if exist. Before a ``conftest.py``
     file is loaded, load ``conftest.py`` files in all of its parent directories.
     After a ``conftest.py`` file is loaded, recursively load all plugins specified
     in its :globalvar:`pytest_plugins` variable if present.


.. _`conftest.py plugins`:
.. _`localplugin`:
.. _`local conftest plugins`:

conftest.py: local per-directory plugins
----------------------------------------

Local ``conftest.py`` plugins contain directory-specific hook
implementations.  Hook Session and test running activities will
invoke all hooks defined in ``conftest.py`` files closer to the
root of the filesystem.  Example of implementing the
``pytest_runtest_setup`` hook so that is called for tests in the ``a``
sub directory but not for other directories::

    a/conftest.py:
        def pytest_runtest_setup(item):
            # called for running each test in 'a' directory
            print("setting up", item)

    a/test_sub.py:
        def test_sub():
            pass

    test_flat.py:
        def test_flat():
            pass

Here is how you might run it::

     pytest test_flat.py --capture=no  # will not show "setting up"
     pytest a/test_sub.py --capture=no  # will show "setting up"

.. note::
    If you have ``conftest.py`` files which do not reside in a
    python package directory (i.e. one containing an ``__init__.py``) then
    "import conftest" can be ambiguous because there might be other
    ``conftest.py`` files as well on your ``PYTHONPATH`` or ``sys.path``.
    It is thus good practice for projects to either put ``conftest.py``
    under a package scope or to never import anything from a
    ``conftest.py`` file.

    See also: :ref:`pythonpath`.

.. note::
    Some hooks cannot be implemented in conftest.py files which are not
    :ref:`initial <pluginorder>` due to how pytest discovers plugins during
    startup. See the documentation of each hook for details.

Writing your own plugin
-----------------------

If you want to write a plugin, there are many real-life examples
you can copy from:

* a custom collection example plugin: :ref:`yaml plugin`
* builtin plugins which provide pytest's own functionality
* many :ref:`external plugins <plugin-list>` providing additional features

All of these plugins implement :ref:`hooks <hook-reference>` and/or :ref:`fixtures <fixture>`
to extend and add functionality.

.. note::
    Make sure to check out the excellent
    `cookiecutter-pytest-plugin <https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin>`_
    project, which is a `cookiecutter template <https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter>`_
    for authoring plugins.

    The template provides an excellent starting point with a working plugin,
    tests running with tox, a comprehensive README file as well as a
    pre-configured entry-point.

Also consider :ref:`contributing your plugin to pytest-dev<submitplugin>`
once it has some happy users other than yourself.


.. _`setuptools entry points`:
.. _`pip-installable plugins`:

Making your plugin installable by others
----------------------------------------

If you want to make your plugin externally available, you
may define a so-called entry point for your distribution so
that ``pytest`` finds your plugin module. Entry points are
a feature that is provided by :std:doc:`packaging tools
<packaging:specifications/entry-points>`.

pytest looks up the ``pytest11`` entrypoint to discover its
plugins, thus you can make your plugin available by defining
it in your ``pyproject.toml`` file.

.. sourcecode:: toml

    # sample ./pyproject.toml file
    [build-system]
    requires = ["hatchling"]
    build-backend = "hatchling.build"

    [project]
    name = "myproject"
    classifiers = [
        "Framework :: Pytest",
    ]

    [project.entry-points.pytest11]
    myproject = "myproject.pluginmodule"

If a package is installed this way, ``pytest`` will load
``myproject.pluginmodule`` as a plugin which can define
:ref:`hooks <hook-reference>`. Confirm registration with ``pytest --trace-config``

.. note::

    Make sure to include ``Framework :: Pytest`` in your list of
    `PyPI classifiers <https://pypi.org/classifiers/>`_
    to make it easy for users to find your plugin.


.. _assertion-rewriting:

Assertion Rewriting
-------------------

One of the main features of ``pytest`` is the use of plain assert
statements and the detailed introspection of expressions upon
assertion failures.  This is provided by "assertion rewriting" which
modifies the parsed AST before it gets compiled to bytecode.  This is
done via a :pep:`302` import hook which gets installed early on when
``pytest`` starts up and will perform this rewriting when modules get
imported.  However, since we do not want to test different bytecode
from what you will run in production, this hook only rewrites test modules
themselves (as defined by the :confval:`python_files` configuration option),
and any modules which are part of plugins.
Any other imported module will not be rewritten and normal assertion behaviour
will happen.

If you have assertion helpers in other modules where you would need
assertion rewriting to be enabled you need to ask ``pytest``
explicitly to rewrite this module before it gets imported.

.. autofunction:: pytest.register_assert_rewrite
    :noindex:

This is especially important when you write a pytest plugin which is
created using a package.  The import hook only treats ``conftest.py``
files and any modules which are listed in the ``pytest11`` entrypoint
as plugins.  As an example consider the following package::

   pytest_foo/__init__.py
   pytest_foo/plugin.py
   pytest_foo/helper.py

With the following typical ``setup.py`` extract:

.. code-block:: python

   setup(..., entry_points={"pytest11": ["foo = pytest_foo.plugin"]}, ...)

In this case only ``pytest_foo/plugin.py`` will be rewritten.  If the
helper module also contains assert statements which need to be
rewritten it needs to be marked as such, before it gets imported.
This is easiest by marking it for rewriting inside the
``__init__.py`` module, which will always be imported first when a
module inside a package is imported.  This way ``plugin.py`` can still
import ``helper.py`` normally.  The contents of
``pytest_foo/__init__.py`` will then need to look like this:

.. code-block:: python

   import pytest

   pytest.register_assert_rewrite("pytest_foo.helper")


Requiring/Loading plugins in a test module or conftest file
-----------------------------------------------------------

You can require plugins in a test module or a ``conftest.py`` file using :globalvar:`pytest_plugins`:

.. code-block:: python

    pytest_plugins = ["name1", "name2"]

When the test module or conftest plugin is loaded the specified plugins
will be loaded as well. Any module can be blessed as a plugin, including internal
application modules:

.. code-block:: python

    pytest_plugins = "myapp.testsupport.myplugin"

:globalvar:`pytest_plugins` are processed recursively, so note that in the example above
if ``myapp.testsupport.myplugin`` also declares :globalvar:`pytest_plugins`, the contents
of the variable will also be loaded as plugins, and so on.

.. _`requiring plugins in non-root conftests`:

.. note::
    Requiring plugins using :globalvar:`pytest_plugins` variable in non-root
    ``conftest.py`` files is deprecated.

    This is important because ``conftest.py`` files implement per-directory
    hook implementations, but once a plugin is imported, it will affect the
    entire directory tree. In order to avoid confusion, defining
    :globalvar:`pytest_plugins` in any ``conftest.py`` file which is not located in the
    tests root directory is deprecated, and will raise a warning.

This mechanism makes it easy to share fixtures within applications or even
external applications without the need to create external plugins using the
:std:doc:`entry point packaging metadata
<packaging:guides/creating-and-discovering-plugins>` technique.

Plugins imported by :globalvar:`pytest_plugins` will also automatically be marked
for assertion rewriting (see :func:`pytest.register_assert_rewrite`).
However for this to have any effect the module must not be
imported already; if it was already imported at the time the
:globalvar:`pytest_plugins` statement is processed, a warning will result and
assertions inside the plugin will not be rewritten.  To fix this you
can either call :func:`pytest.register_assert_rewrite` yourself before
the module is imported, or you can arrange the code to delay the
importing until after the plugin is registered.


Accessing another plugin by name
--------------------------------

If a plugin wants to collaborate with code from
another plugin it can obtain a reference through
the plugin manager like this:

.. sourcecode:: python

    plugin = config.pluginmanager.get_plugin("name_of_plugin")

If you want to look at the names of existing plugins, use
the ``--trace-config`` option.


.. _registering-markers:

Registering custom markers
--------------------------

If your plugin uses any markers, you should register them so that they appear in
pytest's help text and do not :ref:`cause spurious warnings <unknown-marks>`.
For example, the following plugin would register ``cool_marker`` and
``mark_with`` for all users:

.. code-block:: python

    def pytest_configure(config):
        config.addinivalue_line("markers", "cool_marker: this one is for cool tests.")
        config.addinivalue_line(
            "markers", "mark_with(arg, arg2): this marker takes arguments."
        )


Testing plugins
---------------

pytest comes with a plugin named ``pytester`` that helps you write tests for
your plugin code. The plugin is disabled by default, so you will have to enable
it before you can use it.

You can do so by adding the following line to a ``conftest.py`` file in your
testing directory:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py

    pytest_plugins = ["pytester"]

Alternatively you can invoke pytest with the ``-p pytester`` command line
option.

This will allow you to use the :py:class:`pytester <pytest.Pytester>`
fixture for testing your plugin code.

Let's demonstrate what you can do with the plugin with an example. Imagine we
developed a plugin that provides a fixture ``hello`` which yields a function
and we can invoke this function with one optional parameter. It will return a
string value of ``Hello World!`` if we do not supply a value or ``Hello
{value}!`` if we do supply a string value.

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    def pytest_addoption(parser):
        group = parser.getgroup("helloworld")
        group.addoption(
            "--name",
            action="store",
            dest="name",
            default="World",
            help='Default "name" for hello().',
        )


    @pytest.fixture
    def hello(request):
        name = request.config.getoption("name")

        def _hello(name=None):
            if not name:
                name = request.config.getoption("name")
            return f"Hello {name}!"

        return _hello


Now the ``pytester`` fixture provides a convenient API for creating temporary
``conftest.py`` files and test files. It also allows us to run the tests and
return a result object, with which we can assert the tests' outcomes.

.. code-block:: python

    def test_hello(pytester):
        """Make sure that our plugin works."""

        # create a temporary conftest.py file
        pytester.makeconftest(
            """
            import pytest

            @pytest.fixture(params=[
                "Brianna",
                "Andreas",
                "Floris",
            ])
            def name(request):
                return request.param
        """
        )

        # create a temporary pytest test file
        pytester.makepyfile(
            """
            def test_hello_default(hello):
                assert hello() == "Hello World!"

            def test_hello_name(hello, name):
                assert hello(name) == "Hello {0}!".format(name)
        """
        )

        # run all tests with pytest
        result = pytester.runpytest()

        # check that all 4 tests passed
        result.assert_outcomes(passed=4)


Additionally it is possible to copy examples to the ``pytester``'s isolated environment
before running pytest on it. This way we can abstract the tested logic to separate files,
which is especially useful for longer tests and/or longer ``conftest.py`` files.

Note that for ``pytester.copy_example`` to work we need to set `pytester_example_dir`
in our ``pytest.ini`` to tell pytest where to look for example files.

.. code-block:: ini

  # content of pytest.ini
  [pytest]
  pytester_example_dir = .


.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_example.py


    def test_plugin(pytester):
        pytester.copy_example("test_example.py")
        pytester.runpytest("-k", "test_example")


    def test_example():
        pass

## File: doc/en/how-to/xunit_setup.rst
````
.. _`classic xunit`:
.. _xunitsetup:

How to implement xunit-style set-up
========================================

This section describes a classic and popular way how you can implement
fixtures (setup and teardown test state) on a per-module/class/function basis.


.. note::

    While these setup/teardown methods are simple and familiar to those
    coming from a ``unittest`` or ``nose`` background, you may also consider
    using pytest's more powerful :ref:`fixture mechanism
    <fixture>` which leverages the concept of dependency injection, allowing
    for a more modular and more scalable approach for managing test state,
    especially for larger projects and for functional testing.  You can
    mix both fixture mechanisms in the same file but
    test methods of ``unittest.TestCase`` subclasses
    cannot receive fixture arguments.


Module level setup/teardown
--------------------------------------

If you have multiple test functions and test classes in a single
module you can optionally implement the following fixture methods
which will usually be called once for all the functions:

.. code-block:: python

    def setup_module(module):
        """setup any state specific to the execution of the given module."""


    def teardown_module(module):
        """teardown any state that was previously setup with a setup_module
        method.
        """

As of pytest-3.0, the ``module`` parameter is optional.

Class level setup/teardown
----------------------------------

Similarly, the following methods are called at class level before
and after all test methods of the class are called:

.. code-block:: python

    @classmethod
    def setup_class(cls):
        """setup any state specific to the execution of the given class (which
        usually contains tests).
        """


    @classmethod
    def teardown_class(cls):
        """teardown any state that was previously setup with a call to
        setup_class.
        """

.. _xunit-method-setup:

Method and function level setup/teardown
-----------------------------------------------

Similarly, the following methods are called around each method invocation:

.. code-block:: python

    def setup_method(self, method):
        """setup any state tied to the execution of the given method in a
        class.  setup_method is invoked for every test method of a class.
        """


    def teardown_method(self, method):
        """teardown any state that was previously setup with a setup_method
        call.
        """

As of pytest-3.0, the ``method`` parameter is optional.

If you would rather define test functions directly at module level
you can also use the following functions to implement fixtures:

.. code-block:: python

    def setup_function(function):
        """setup any state tied to the execution of the given function.
        Invoked for every test function in the module.
        """


    def teardown_function(function):
        """teardown any state that was previously setup with a setup_function
        call.
        """

As of pytest-3.0, the ``function`` parameter is optional.

Remarks:

* It is possible for setup/teardown pairs to be invoked multiple times
  per testing process.

* teardown functions are not called if the corresponding setup function existed
  and failed/was skipped.

* Prior to pytest-4.2, xunit-style functions did not obey the scope rules of fixtures, so
  it was possible, for example, for a ``setup_method`` to be called before a
  session-scoped autouse fixture.

  Now the xunit-style functions are integrated with the fixture mechanism and obey the proper
  scope rules of fixtures involved in the call.

## File: doc/en/proposals/parametrize_with_fixtures.rst

:orphan:

===================================
PROPOSAL: Parametrize with fixtures
===================================

.. warning::

    This document outlines a proposal around using fixtures as input
    of parametrized tests or fixtures.

Problem
-------

As a user I have functional tests that I would like to run against various
scenarios.

In this particular example we want to generate a new project based on a
cookiecutter template. We want to test default values but also data that
emulates user input.

- use default values

- emulate user input

  - specify 'author'

  - specify 'project_slug'

  - specify 'author' and 'project_slug'

This is how a functional test could look like:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture
    def default_context():
        return {"extra_context": {}}


    @pytest.fixture(
        params=[
            {"author": "alice"},
            {"project_slug": "helloworld"},
            {"author": "bob", "project_slug": "foobar"},
        ]
    )
    def extra_context(request):
        return {"extra_context": request.param}


    @pytest.fixture(params=["default", "extra"])
    def context(request):
        if request.param == "default":
            return request.getfuncargvalue("default_context")
        else:
            return request.getfuncargvalue("extra_context")


    def test_generate_project(cookies, context):
        """Call the cookiecutter API to generate a new project from a
        template.
        """
        result = cookies.bake(extra_context=context)

        assert result.exit_code == 0
        assert result.exception is None
        assert result.project.isdir()


Issues
------

* By using ``request.getfuncargvalue()`` we rely on actual fixture function
  execution to know what fixtures are involved, due to its dynamic nature
* More importantly, ``request.getfuncargvalue()`` cannot be combined with
  parametrized fixtures, such as ``extra_context``
* This is very inconvenient if you wish to extend an existing test suite by
  certain parameters for fixtures that are already used by tests

pytest version 3.0 reports an error if you try to run above code::

    Failed: The requested fixture has no parameter defined for the current
    test.

    Requested fixture 'extra_context'


Proposed solution
-----------------

A new function that can be used in modules can be used to dynamically define
fixtures from existing ones.

.. code-block:: python

    pytest.define_combined_fixture(
        name="context", fixtures=["default_context", "extra_context"]
    )

The new fixture ``context`` inherits the scope from the used fixtures and yield
the following values.

- ``{}``

- ``{'author': 'alice'}``

- ``{'project_slug': 'helloworld'}``

- ``{'author': 'bob', 'project_slug': 'foobar'}``

Alternative approach
--------------------

A new helper function named ``fixture_request`` would tell pytest to yield
all parameters marked as a fixture.

.. note::

    The :pypi:`pytest-lazy-fixture` plugin implements a very
    similar solution to the proposal below, make sure to check it out.

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture(
        params=[
            pytest.fixture_request("default_context"),
            pytest.fixture_request("extra_context"),
        ]
    )
    def context(request):
        """Returns all values for ``default_context``, one-by-one before it
        does the same for ``extra_context``.

        request.param:
            - {}
            - {'author': 'alice'}
            - {'project_slug': 'helloworld'}
            - {'author': 'bob', 'project_slug': 'foobar'}
        """
        return request.param

The same helper can be used in combination with ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.

.. code-block:: python


    @pytest.mark.parametrize(
        "context, expected_response_code",
        [
            (pytest.fixture_request("default_context"), 0),
            (pytest.fixture_request("extra_context"), 0),
        ],
    )
    def test_generate_project(cookies, context, exit_code):
        """Call the cookiecutter API to generate a new project from a
        template.
        """
        result = cookies.bake(extra_context=context)

        assert result.exit_code == exit_code

Configuration
=============

Command line options and configuration file settings
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You can get help on command line options and values in INI-style
configurations files by using the general help option:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -h   # prints options _and_ config file settings

This will display command line and configuration file settings
which were registered by installed plugins.

.. _`config file formats`:

Configuration file formats
--------------------------

Many :ref:`pytest settings <ini options ref>` can be set in a *configuration file*, which
by convention resides in the root directory of your repository.

A quick example of the configuration files supported by pytest:

pytest.ini
~~~~~~~~~~

``pytest.ini`` files take precedence over other files, even when empty.

Alternatively, the hidden version ``.pytest.ini`` can be used.

.. code-block:: ini

    # pytest.ini or .pytest.ini
    [pytest]
    minversion = 6.0
    addopts = -ra -q
    testpaths =
        tests
        integration


pyproject.toml
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 6.0

``pyproject.toml`` are considered for configuration when they contain a ``tool.pytest.ini_options`` table.

.. code-block:: toml

    # pyproject.toml
    [tool.pytest.ini_options]
    minversion = "6.0"
    addopts = "-ra -q"
    testpaths = [
        "tests",
        "integration",
    ]

.. note::

    One might wonder why ``[tool.pytest.ini_options]`` instead of ``[tool.pytest]`` as is the
    case with other tools.

    The reason is that the pytest team intends to fully utilize the rich TOML data format
    for configuration in the future, reserving the ``[tool.pytest]`` table for that.
    The ``ini_options`` table is being used, for now, as a bridge between the existing
    ``.ini`` configuration system and the future configuration format.

tox.ini
~~~~~~~

``tox.ini`` files are the configuration files of the `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io>`__ project,
and can also be used to hold pytest configuration if they have a ``[pytest]`` section.

.. code-block:: ini

    # tox.ini
    [pytest]
    minversion = 6.0
    addopts = -ra -q
    testpaths =
        tests
        integration


setup.cfg
~~~~~~~~~

``setup.cfg`` files are general purpose configuration files, used originally by ``distutils`` (now deprecated) and :std:doc:`setuptools <setuptools:userguide/declarative_config>`, and can also be used to hold pytest configuration
if they have a ``[tool:pytest]`` section.

.. code-block:: ini

    # setup.cfg
    [tool:pytest]
    minversion = 6.0
    addopts = -ra -q
    testpaths =
        tests
        integration

.. warning::

    Usage of ``setup.cfg`` is not recommended unless for very simple use cases. ``.cfg``
    files use a different parser than ``pytest.ini`` and ``tox.ini`` which might cause hard to track
    down problems.
    When possible, it is recommended to use the latter files, or ``pyproject.toml``, to hold your
    pytest configuration.


.. _rootdir:
.. _configfiles:

Initialization: determining rootdir and configfile
--------------------------------------------------

pytest determines a ``rootdir`` for each test run which depends on
the command line arguments (specified test files, paths) and on
the existence of configuration files.  The determined ``rootdir`` and ``configfile`` are
printed as part of the pytest header during startup.

Here's a summary what ``pytest`` uses ``rootdir`` for:

* Construct *nodeids* during collection; each test is assigned
  a unique *nodeid* which is rooted at the ``rootdir`` and takes into account
  the full path, class name, function name and parametrization (if any).

* Is used by plugins as a stable location to store project/test run specific information;
  for example, the internal :ref:`cache <cache>` plugin creates a ``.pytest_cache`` subdirectory
  in ``rootdir`` to store its cross-test run state.

``rootdir`` is **NOT** used to modify ``sys.path``/``PYTHONPATH`` or
influence how modules are imported. See :ref:`pythonpath` for more details.

The ``--rootdir=path`` command-line option can be used to force a specific directory.
Note that contrary to other command-line options, ``--rootdir`` cannot be used with
:confval:`addopts` inside ``pytest.ini`` because the ``rootdir`` is used to *find* ``pytest.ini``
already.

Finding the ``rootdir``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is the algorithm which finds the rootdir from ``args``:

- If ``-c`` is passed in the command-line, use that as configuration file, and its directory as ``rootdir``.

- Determine the common ancestor directory for the specified ``args`` that are
  recognised as paths that exist in the file system. If no such paths are
  found, the common ancestor directory is set to the current working directory.

- Look for ``pytest.ini``, ``pyproject.toml``, ``tox.ini``, and ``setup.cfg`` files in the ancestor
  directory and upwards.  If one is matched, it becomes the ``configfile`` and its
  directory becomes the ``rootdir``.

- If no configuration file was found, look for ``setup.py`` upwards from the common
  ancestor directory to determine the ``rootdir``.

- If no ``setup.py`` was found, look for ``pytest.ini``, ``pyproject.toml``, ``tox.ini``, and
  ``setup.cfg`` in each of the specified ``args`` and upwards. If one is
  matched, it becomes the ``configfile`` and its directory becomes the ``rootdir``.

- If no ``configfile`` was found and no configuration argument is passed, use the already determined common ancestor as root
  directory. This allows the use of pytest in structures that are not part of
  a package and don't have any particular configuration file.

If no ``args`` are given, pytest collects test below the current working
directory and also starts determining the ``rootdir`` from there.

Files will only be matched for configuration if:

* ``pytest.ini``: will always match and take precedence, even if empty.
* ``pyproject.toml``: contains a ``[tool.pytest.ini_options]`` table.
* ``tox.ini``: contains a ``[pytest]`` section.
* ``setup.cfg``: contains a ``[tool:pytest]`` section.

Finally, a ``pyproject.toml`` file will be considered the ``configfile`` if no other match was found, in this case
even if it does not contain a ``[tool.pytest.ini_options]`` table (this was added in ``8.1``).

The files are considered in the order above. Options from multiple ``configfiles`` candidates
are never merged - the first match wins.

The configuration file also determines the value of the ``rootpath``.

The :class:`Config <pytest.Config>` object (accessible via hooks or through the :fixture:`pytestconfig` fixture)
will subsequently carry these attributes:

- :attr:`config.rootpath <pytest.Config.rootpath>`: the determined root directory, guaranteed to exist. It is used as
  a reference directory for constructing test addresses ("nodeids") and can be used also by plugins for storing
  per-testrun information.

- :attr:`config.inipath <pytest.Config.inipath>`: the determined ``configfile``, may be ``None``
  (it is named ``inipath`` for historical reasons).

.. versionadded:: 6.1
    The ``config.rootpath`` and ``config.inipath`` properties. They are :class:`pathlib.Path`
    versions of the older ``config.rootdir`` and ``config.inifile``, which have type
    ``py.path.local``, and still exist for backward compatibility.



Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest path/to/testdir path/other/

will determine the common ancestor as ``path`` and then
check for configuration files as follows:

.. code-block:: text

    # first look for pytest.ini files
    path/pytest.ini
    path/pyproject.toml  # must contain a [tool.pytest.ini_options] table to match
    path/tox.ini         # must contain [pytest] section to match
    path/setup.cfg       # must contain [tool:pytest] section to match
    pytest.ini
    ... # all the way up to the root

    # now look for setup.py
    path/setup.py
    setup.py
    ... # all the way up to the root


.. warning::

    Custom pytest plugin commandline arguments may include a path, as in
    ``pytest --log-output ../../test.log args``. Then ``args`` is mandatory,
    otherwise pytest uses the folder of test.log for rootdir determination
    (see also :issue:`1435`).
    A dot ``.`` for referencing to the current working directory is also
    possible.

For the full list of options consult the :ref:`reference documentation <ini options ref>`.

Syntax highlighting theme customization
---------------------------------------

The syntax highlighting themes used by pytest can be customized using two environment variables:

- :envvar:`PYTEST_THEME` sets a `pygment style <https://pygments.org/docs/styles/>`_ to use.
- :envvar:`PYTEST_THEME_MODE` sets this style to *light* or *dark*.

.. _exit-codes:

Exit codes
========================================================

Running ``pytest`` can result in six different exit codes:

:Exit code 0: All tests were collected and passed successfully
:Exit code 1: Tests were collected and run but some of the tests failed
:Exit code 2: Test execution was interrupted by the user
:Exit code 3: Internal error happened while executing tests
:Exit code 4: pytest command line usage error
:Exit code 5: No tests were collected

They are represented by the :class:`pytest.ExitCode` enum. The exit codes being a part of the public API can be imported and accessed directly using:

.. code-block:: python

    from pytest import ExitCode

.. note::

    If you would like to customize the exit code in some scenarios, specially when
    no tests are collected, consider using the
    `pytest-custom_exit_code <https://github.com/yashtodi94/pytest-custom_exit_code>`__

Fixture availability
---------------------

Fixture availability is determined from the perspective of the test. A fixture
is only available for tests to request if they are in the scope that fixture is
defined in. If a fixture is defined inside a class, it can only be requested by
tests inside that class. But if a fixture is defined inside the global scope of
the module, then every test in that module, even if it's defined inside a class,
can request it.

Similarly, a test can also only be affected by an autouse fixture if that test
is in the same scope that autouse fixture is defined in (see
:ref:`autouse order`).

A fixture can also request any other fixture, no matter where it's defined, so
long as the test requesting them can see all fixtures involved.

For example, here's a test file with a fixture (``outer``) that requests a
fixture (``inner``) from a scope it wasn't defined in:

.. literalinclude:: /example/fixtures/test_fixtures_request_different_scope.py

From the tests' perspectives, they have no problem seeing each of the fixtures
they're dependent on:

.. image:: /example/fixtures/test_fixtures_request_different_scope.*
    :align: center

So when they run, ``outer`` will have no problem finding ``inner``, because
pytest searched from the tests' perspectives.

.. note::
    The scope a fixture is defined in has no bearing on the order it will be
    instantiated in: the order is mandated by the logic described
    :ref:`here <fixture order>`.

``conftest.py``: sharing fixtures across multiple files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``conftest.py`` file serves as a means of providing fixtures for an entire
directory. Fixtures defined in a ``conftest.py`` can be used by any test
in that package without needing to import them (pytest will automatically
discover them).

You can have multiple nested directories/packages containing your tests, and
each directory can have its own ``conftest.py`` with its own fixtures, adding on
to the ones provided by the ``conftest.py`` files in parent directories.

For example, given a test file structure like this:

::

    tests/
        __init__.py

        conftest.py
            # content of tests/conftest.py
            import pytest

            @pytest.fixture
            def order():
                return []

            @pytest.fixture
            def top(order, innermost):
                order.append("top")

        test_top.py
            # content of tests/test_top.py
            import pytest

            @pytest.fixture
            def innermost(order):
                order.append("innermost top")

            def test_order(order, top):
                assert order == ["innermost top", "top"]

        subpackage/
            __init__.py

            conftest.py
                # content of tests/subpackage/conftest.py
                import pytest

                @pytest.fixture
                def mid(order):
                    order.append("mid subpackage")

            test_subpackage.py
                # content of tests/subpackage/test_subpackage.py
                import pytest

                @pytest.fixture
                def innermost(order, mid):
                    order.append("innermost subpackage")

                def test_order(order, top):
                    assert order == ["mid subpackage", "innermost subpackage", "top"]

The boundaries of the scopes can be visualized like this:

.. image:: /example/fixtures/fixture_availability.*
    :align: center

The directories become their own sort of scope where fixtures that are defined
in a ``conftest.py`` file in that directory become available for that whole
scope.

Tests are allowed to search upward (stepping outside a circle) for fixtures, but
can never go down (stepping inside a circle) to continue their search. So
``tests/subpackage/test_subpackage.py::test_order`` would be able to find the
``innermost`` fixture defined in ``tests/subpackage/test_subpackage.py``, but
the one defined in ``tests/test_top.py`` would be unavailable to it because it
would have to step down a level (step inside a circle) to find it.

The first fixture the test finds is the one that will be used, so
:ref:`fixtures can be overridden <override fixtures>` if you need to change or
extend what one does for a particular scope.

You can also use the ``conftest.py`` file to implement
:ref:`local per-directory plugins <conftest.py plugins>`.

Fixtures from third-party plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixtures don't have to be defined in this structure to be available for tests,
though. They can also be provided by third-party plugins that are installed, and
this is how many pytest plugins operate. As long as those plugins are installed,
the fixtures they provide can be requested from anywhere in your test suite.

Because they're provided from outside the structure of your test suite,
third-party plugins don't really provide a scope like `conftest.py` files and
the directories in your test suite do. As a result, pytest will search for
fixtures stepping out through scopes as explained previously, only reaching
fixtures defined in plugins *last*.

For example, given the following file structure:

::

    tests/
        __init__.py

        conftest.py
            # content of tests/conftest.py
            import pytest

            @pytest.fixture
            def order():
                return []

        subpackage/
            __init__.py

            conftest.py
                # content of tests/subpackage/conftest.py
                import pytest

                @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
                def mid(order, b_fix):
                    order.append("mid subpackage")

            test_subpackage.py
                # content of tests/subpackage/test_subpackage.py
                import pytest

                @pytest.fixture
                def inner(order, mid, a_fix):
                    order.append("inner subpackage")

                def test_order(order, inner):
                    assert order == ["b_fix", "mid subpackage", "a_fix", "inner subpackage"]

If ``plugin_a`` is installed and provides the fixture ``a_fix``, and
``plugin_b`` is installed and provides the fixture ``b_fix``, then this is what
the test's search for fixtures would look like:

.. image:: /example/fixtures/fixture_availability_plugins.svg
    :align: center

pytest will only search for ``a_fix`` and ``b_fix`` in the plugins after
searching for them first in the scopes inside ``tests/``.

.. note:

    pytest can tell you what fixtures are available for a given test if you call
    ``pytests`` along with the test's name (or the scope it's in), and provide
    the ``--fixtures`` flag, e.g. ``pytest --fixtures test_something.py``
    (fixtures with names that start with ``_`` will only be shown if you also
    provide the ``-v`` flag).


.. _`fixture order`:

Fixture instantiation order
---------------------------

When pytest wants to execute a test, once it knows what fixtures will be
executed, it has to figure out the order they'll be executed in. To do this, it
considers 3 factors:

1. scope
2. dependencies
3. autouse

Names of fixtures or tests, where they're defined, the order they're defined in,
and the order fixtures are requested in have no bearing on execution order
beyond coincidence. While pytest will try to make sure coincidences like these
stay consistent from run to run, it's not something that should be depended on.
If you want to control the order, it's safest to rely on these 3 things and make
sure dependencies are clearly established.

Higher-scoped fixtures are executed first
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Within a function request for fixtures, those of higher-scopes (such as
``session``) are executed before lower-scoped fixtures (such as ``function`` or
``class``).

Here's an example:

.. literalinclude:: /example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_scope.py

The test will pass because the larger scoped fixtures are executing first.

The order breaks down to this:

.. image:: /example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_scope.*
    :align: center

Fixtures of the same order execute based on dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a fixture requests another fixture, the other fixture is executed first.
So if fixture ``a`` requests fixture ``b``, fixture ``b`` will execute first,
because ``a`` depends on ``b`` and can't operate without it. Even if ``a``
doesn't need the result of ``b``, it can still request ``b`` if it needs to make
sure it is executed after ``b``.

For example:

.. literalinclude:: /example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_dependencies.py

If we map out what depends on what, we get something that looks like this:

.. image:: /example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_dependencies.*
    :align: center

The rules provided by each fixture (as to what fixture(s) each one has to come
after) are comprehensive enough that it can be flattened to this:

.. image:: /example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_dependencies_flat.*
    :align: center

Enough information has to be provided through these requests in order for pytest
to be able to figure out a clear, linear chain of dependencies, and as a result,
an order of operations for a given test. If there's any ambiguity, and the order
of operations can be interpreted more than one way, you should assume pytest
could go with any one of those interpretations at any point.

For example, if ``d`` didn't request ``c``, i.e.the graph would look like this:

.. image:: /example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_dependencies_unclear.*
    :align: center

Because nothing requested ``c`` other than ``g``, and ``g`` also requests ``f``,
it's now unclear if ``c`` should go before/after ``f``, ``e``, or ``d``. The
only rules that were set for ``c`` is that it must execute after ``b`` and
before ``g``.

pytest doesn't know where ``c`` should go in the case, so it should be assumed
that it could go anywhere between ``g`` and ``b``.

This isn't necessarily bad, but it's something to keep in mind. If the order
they execute in could affect the behavior a test is targeting, or could
otherwise influence the result of a test, then the order should be defined
explicitly in a way that allows pytest to linearize/"flatten" that order.

.. _`autouse order`:

Autouse fixtures are executed first within their scope
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Autouse fixtures are assumed to apply to every test that could reference them,
so they are executed before other fixtures in that scope. Fixtures that are
requested by autouse fixtures effectively become autouse fixtures themselves for
the tests that the real autouse fixture applies to.

So if fixture ``a`` is autouse and fixture ``b`` is not, but fixture ``a``
requests fixture ``b``, then fixture ``b`` will effectively be an autouse
fixture as well, but only for the tests that ``a`` applies to.

In the last example, the graph became unclear if ``d`` didn't request ``c``. But
if ``c`` was autouse, then ``b`` and ``a`` would effectively also be autouse
because ``c`` depends on them. As a result, they would all be shifted above
non-autouse fixtures within that scope.

So if the test file looked like this:

.. literalinclude:: /example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_autouse.py

the graph would look like this:

.. image:: /example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_autouse.*
    :align: center

Because ``c`` can now be put above ``d`` in the graph, pytest can once again
linearize the graph to this:

.. image:: /example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_autouse_flat.*
    :align: center

In this example, ``c`` makes ``b`` and ``a`` effectively autouse fixtures as
well.

Be careful with autouse, though, as an autouse fixture will automatically
execute for every test that can reach it, even if they don't request it. For
example, consider this file:

.. literalinclude:: /example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_autouse_multiple_scopes.py

Even though nothing in ``TestClassWithoutC1Request`` is requesting ``c1``, it still
is executed for the tests inside it anyway:

.. image:: /example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_autouse_multiple_scopes.*
    :align: center

But just because one autouse fixture requested a non-autouse fixture, that
doesn't mean the non-autouse fixture becomes an autouse fixture for all contexts
that it can apply to. It only effectively becomes an autouse fixture for the
contexts the real autouse fixture (the one that requested the non-autouse
fixture) can apply to.

For example, take a look at this test file:

.. literalinclude:: /example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_autouse_temp_effects.py

It would break down to something like this:

.. image:: /example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_autouse_temp_effects.*
    :align: center

For ``test_req`` and ``test_no_req`` inside ``TestClassWithAutouse``, ``c3``
effectively makes ``c2`` an autouse fixture, which is why ``c2`` and ``c3`` are
executed for both tests, despite not being requested, and why ``c2`` and ``c3``
are executed before ``c1`` for ``test_req``.

If this made ``c2`` an *actual* autouse fixture, then ``c2`` would also execute
for the tests inside ``TestClassWithoutAutouse``, since they can reference
``c2`` if they wanted to. But it doesn't, because from the perspective of the
``TestClassWithoutAutouse`` tests, ``c2`` isn't an autouse fixture, since they
can't see ``c3``.


.. note:

    pytest can tell you what order the fixtures will execute in for a given test
    if you call ``pytests`` along with the test's name (or the scope it's in),
    and provide the ``--setup-plan`` flag, e.g.
    ``pytest --setup-plan test_something.py`` (fixtures with names that start
    with ``_`` will only be shown if you also provide the ``-v`` flag).

   :pypi:`pytest-lock`                              pytest-lock is a pytest plugin that allows you to "lock" the results of unit tests, storing them in a local cache. This is particularly useful for tests that are resource-intensive or don't need to be run every time. When the tests are run subsequently, pytest-lock will compare the current results with the locked results and issue a warning if there are any discrepancies.

This page contains the full reference to pytest's API.


Constants
---------

pytest.__version__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The current pytest version, as a string::

    >>> import pytest
    >>> pytest.__version__
    '7.0.0'

.. _`hidden-param`:

pytest.HIDDEN_PARAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 8.4

Can be passed to ``ids`` of :py:func:`Metafunc.parametrize <pytest.Metafunc.parametrize>`
or to ``id`` of :func:`pytest.param` to hide a parameter set from the test name.
Can only be used at most 1 time, as test names need to be unique.

Marks
-----

Marks can be used to apply metadata to *test functions* (but not fixtures), which can then be accessed by
fixtures or plugins.




.. _`pytest.mark.filterwarnings ref`:

pytest.mark.filterwarnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Tutorial**: :ref:`filterwarnings`

Add warning filters to marked test items.

.. py:function:: pytest.mark.filterwarnings(filter)

    :keyword str filter:
        A *warning specification string*, which is composed of contents of the tuple ``(action, message, category, module, lineno)``
        as specified in :ref:`python:warning-filter` section of
        the Python documentation, separated by ``":"``. Optional fields can be omitted.
        Module names passed for filtering are not regex-escaped.

        For example:

        .. code-block:: python

            @pytest.mark.filterwarnings("ignore:.*usage will be deprecated.*:DeprecationWarning")
            def test_foo(): ...


.. _`pytest.mark.parametrize ref`:

pytest.mark.parametrize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Tutorial**: :ref:`parametrize`

This mark has the same signature as :py:meth:`pytest.Metafunc.parametrize`; see there.


.. _`pytest.mark.skip ref`:

pytest.mark.skip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Tutorial**: :ref:`skip`

Unconditionally skip a test function.

.. py:function:: pytest.mark.skip(reason=None)

    :keyword str reason: Reason why the test function is being skipped.


.. _`pytest.mark.skipif ref`:

pytest.mark.skipif
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Tutorial**: :ref:`skipif`

Skip a test function if a condition is ``True``.

.. py:function:: pytest.mark.skipif(condition, *, reason=None)

    :type condition: bool or str
    :param condition: ``True/False`` if the condition should be skipped or a :ref:`condition string <string conditions>`.
    :keyword str reason: Reason why the test function is being skipped.


.. _`pytest.mark.usefixtures ref`:

pytest.mark.usefixtures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Tutorial**: :ref:`usefixtures`

Mark a test function as using the given fixture names.

.. py:function:: pytest.mark.usefixtures(*names)

    :param args: The names of the fixture to use, as strings.

.. note::

    When using `usefixtures` in hooks, it can only load fixtures when applied to a test function before test setup
    (for example in the `pytest_collection_modifyitems` hook).

    Also note that this mark has no effect when applied to **fixtures**.



.. _`pytest.mark.xfail ref`:

pytest.mark.xfail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Tutorial**: :ref:`xfail`

Marks a test function as *expected to fail*.

.. py:function:: pytest.mark.xfail(condition=False, *, reason=None, raises=None, run=True, strict=xfail_strict)

    :keyword Union[bool, str] condition:
        Condition for marking the test function as xfail (``True/False`` or a
        :ref:`condition string <string conditions>`). If a ``bool``, you also have
        to specify ``reason`` (see :ref:`condition string <string conditions>`).
    :keyword str reason:
        Reason why the test function is marked as xfail.
    :keyword raises:
        Exception class (or tuple of classes) expected to be raised by the test function; other exceptions will fail the test.
        Note that subclasses of the classes passed will also result in a match (similar to how the ``except`` statement works).
    :type raises: Type[:py:exc:`Exception`]

    :keyword bool run:
        Whether the test function should actually be executed. If ``False``, the function will always xfail and will
        not be executed (useful if a function is segfaulting).
    :keyword bool strict:
        * If ``False`` the function will be shown in the terminal output as ``xfailed`` if it fails
          and as ``xpass`` if it passes. In both cases this will not cause the test suite to fail as a whole. This
          is particularly useful to mark *flaky* tests (tests that fail at random) to be tackled later.
        * If ``True``, the function will be shown in the terminal output as ``xfailed`` if it fails, but if it
          unexpectedly passes then it will **fail** the test suite. This is particularly useful to mark functions
          that are always failing and there should be a clear indication if they unexpectedly start to pass (for example
          a new release of a library fixes a known bug).

        Defaults to :confval:`xfail_strict`, which is ``False`` by default.


Custom marks
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Marks are created dynamically using the factory object ``pytest.mark`` and applied as a decorator.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.timeout(10, "slow", method="thread")
    def test_function(): ...

Will create and attach a :class:`Mark <pytest.Mark>` object to the collected
:class:`Item <pytest.Item>`, which can then be accessed by fixtures or hooks with
:meth:`Node.iter_markers <_pytest.nodes.Node.iter_markers>`. The ``mark`` object will have the following attributes:

.. code-block:: python

    mark.args == (10, "slow")
    mark.kwargs == {"method": "thread"}

Example for using multiple custom markers:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.timeout(10, "slow", method="thread")
    @pytest.mark.slow
    def test_function(): ...

When :meth:`Node.iter_markers <_pytest.nodes.Node.iter_markers>` or :meth:`Node.iter_markers_with_node <_pytest.nodes.Node.iter_markers_with_node>` is used with multiple markers, the marker closest to the function will be iterated over first. The above example will result in ``@pytest.mark.slow`` followed by ``@pytest.mark.timeout(...)``.

.. _`fixtures-api`:

Fixtures
--------

**Tutorial**: :ref:`fixture`

Fixtures are requested by test functions or other fixtures by declaring them as argument names.


Example of a test requiring a fixture:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_output(capsys):
        print("hello")
        out, err = capsys.readouterr()
        assert out == "hello\n"


Example of a fixture requiring another fixture:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture
    def db_session(tmp_path):
        fn = tmp_path / "db.file"
        return connect(fn)

For more details, consult the full :ref:`fixtures docs <fixture>`.

.. hook:: pytest_addoption
.. autofunction:: pytest_addoption
.. hook:: pytest_addhooks
.. autofunction:: pytest_addhooks
.. hook:: pytest_configure
.. autofunction:: pytest_configure
.. hook:: pytest_unconfigure
.. autofunction:: pytest_unconfigure
.. hook:: pytest_sessionstart
.. autofunction:: pytest_sessionstart
.. hook:: pytest_sessionfinish
.. autofunction:: pytest_sessionfinish

.. hook:: pytest_plugin_registered
.. autofunction:: pytest_plugin_registered

Collection hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``pytest`` calls the following hooks for collecting files and directories:

.. hook:: pytest_collection
.. autofunction:: pytest_collection
.. hook:: pytest_ignore_collect
.. autofunction:: pytest_ignore_collect
.. hook:: pytest_collect_directory
.. autofunction:: pytest_collect_directory
.. hook:: pytest_collect_file
.. autofunction:: pytest_collect_file
.. hook:: pytest_pycollect_makemodule
.. autofunction:: pytest_pycollect_makemodule

For influencing the collection of objects in Python modules
you can use the following hook:

.. hook:: pytest_pycollect_makeitem
.. autofunction:: pytest_pycollect_makeitem
.. hook:: pytest_generate_tests
.. autofunction:: pytest_generate_tests
.. hook:: pytest_make_parametrize_id
.. autofunction:: pytest_make_parametrize_id

Hooks for influencing test skipping:

.. hook:: pytest_markeval_namespace
.. autofunction:: pytest_markeval_namespace

After collection is complete, you can modify the order of
items, delete or otherwise amend the test items:

.. hook:: pytest_collection_modifyitems
.. autofunction:: pytest_collection_modifyitems

.. note::
    If this hook is implemented in ``conftest.py`` files, it always receives all collected items, not only those
    under the ``conftest.py`` where it is implemented.

.. autofunction:: pytest_collection_finish

Test running (runtest) hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All runtest related hooks receive a :py:class:`pytest.Item <pytest.Item>` object.

.. hook:: pytest_runtestloop
.. autofunction:: pytest_runtestloop
.. hook:: pytest_runtest_protocol
.. autofunction:: pytest_runtest_protocol
.. hook:: pytest_runtest_logstart
.. autofunction:: pytest_runtest_logstart
.. hook:: pytest_runtest_logfinish
.. autofunction:: pytest_runtest_logfinish
.. hook:: pytest_runtest_setup
.. autofunction:: pytest_runtest_setup
.. hook:: pytest_runtest_call
.. autofunction:: pytest_runtest_call
.. hook:: pytest_runtest_teardown
.. autofunction:: pytest_runtest_teardown
.. hook:: pytest_runtest_makereport
.. autofunction:: pytest_runtest_makereport

For deeper understanding you may look at the default implementation of
these hooks in ``_pytest.runner`` and maybe also
in ``_pytest.pdb`` which interacts with ``_pytest.capture``
and its input/output capturing in order to immediately drop
into interactive debugging when a test failure occurs.

.. hook:: pytest_pyfunc_call
.. autofunction:: pytest_pyfunc_call

Global Variables
----------------

pytest treats some global variables in a special manner when defined in a test module or
``conftest.py`` files.


.. globalvar:: collect_ignore

**Tutorial**: :ref:`customizing-test-collection`

Can be declared in *conftest.py files* to exclude test directories or modules.
Needs to be a list of paths (``str``, :class:`pathlib.Path` or any :class:`os.PathLike`).

.. code-block:: python

  collect_ignore = ["setup.py"]


.. globalvar:: collect_ignore_glob

**Tutorial**: :ref:`customizing-test-collection`

Can be declared in *conftest.py files* to exclude test directories or modules
with Unix shell-style wildcards. Needs to be ``list[str]`` where ``str`` can
contain glob patterns.

.. code-block:: python

  collect_ignore_glob = ["*_ignore.py"]


.. globalvar:: pytest_plugins

**Tutorial**: :ref:`available installable plugins`

Can be declared at the **global** level in *test modules* and *conftest.py files* to register additional plugins.
Can be either a ``str`` or ``Sequence[str]``.

.. code-block:: python

    pytest_plugins = "myapp.testsupport.myplugin"

.. code-block:: python

    pytest_plugins = ("myapp.testsupport.tools", "myapp.testsupport.regression")


.. globalvar:: pytestmark

**Tutorial**: :ref:`scoped-marking`

Can be declared at the **global** level in *test modules* to apply one or more :ref:`marks <marks ref>` to all
test functions and methods. Can be either a single mark or a list of marks (applied in left-to-right order).

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest

    pytestmark = pytest.mark.webtest


.. code-block:: python

    import pytest

    pytestmark = [pytest.mark.integration, pytest.mark.slow]


Environment Variables
---------------------

Environment variables that can be used to change pytest's behavior.

.. envvar:: CI

When set (regardless of value), pytest acknowledges that is running in a CI process. Alternative to ``BUILD_NUMBER`` variable. See also :ref:`ci-pipelines`.

.. envvar:: BUILD_NUMBER

When set (regardless of value), pytest acknowledges that is running in a CI process. Alternative to CI variable. See also :ref:`ci-pipelines`.

.. envvar:: PYTEST_ADDOPTS

This contains a command-line (parsed by the py:mod:`shlex` module) that will be **prepended** to the command line given
by the user, see :ref:`adding default options` for more information.

.. envvar:: PYTEST_VERSION

This environment variable is defined at the start of the pytest session and is undefined afterwards.
It contains the value of ``pytest.__version__``, and among other things can be used to easily check if a code is running from within a pytest run.

.. envvar:: PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST

This is not meant to be set by users, but is set by pytest internally with the name of the current test so other
processes can inspect it, see :ref:`pytest current test env` for more information.

.. envvar:: PYTEST_DEBUG

When set, pytest will print tracing and debug information.

.. envvar:: PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT

Root for temporary directories produced by fixtures like :fixture:`tmp_path`
as discussed in :ref:`temporary directory location and retention`.

.. envvar:: PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD

When set, disables plugin auto-loading through :std:doc:`entry point packaging
metadata <packaging:guides/creating-and-discovering-plugins>`. Only plugins
explicitly specified in :envvar:`PYTEST_PLUGINS` or with ``-p`` will be loaded.
See also :ref:`--disable-plugin-autoload <disable_plugin_autoload>`.

.. envvar:: PYTEST_PLUGINS

Contains comma-separated list of modules that should be loaded as plugins:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PYTEST_PLUGINS=mymodule.plugin,xdist

See also ``-p``.

.. envvar:: PYTEST_THEME

Sets a `pygment style <https://pygments.org/docs/styles/>`_ to use for the code output.

.. envvar:: PYTEST_THEME_MODE

Sets the :envvar:`PYTEST_THEME` to be either *dark* or *light*.

.. envvar:: PY_COLORS

When set to ``1``, pytest will use color in terminal output.
When set to ``0``, pytest will not use color.
``PY_COLORS`` takes precedence over ``NO_COLOR`` and ``FORCE_COLOR``.

.. envvar:: NO_COLOR

When set to a non-empty string (regardless of value), pytest will not use color in terminal output.
``PY_COLORS`` takes precedence over ``NO_COLOR``, which takes precedence over ``FORCE_COLOR``.
See `no-color.org <https://no-color.org/>`__ for other libraries supporting this community standard.

.. envvar:: FORCE_COLOR

When set to a non-empty string (regardless of value), pytest will use color in terminal output.
``PY_COLORS`` and ``NO_COLOR`` take precedence over ``FORCE_COLOR``.

.. _`ini options ref`:

Configuration Options
---------------------

Here is a list of builtin configuration options that may be written in a ``pytest.ini`` (or ``.pytest.ini``),
``pyproject.toml``, ``tox.ini``, or ``setup.cfg`` file, usually located at the root of your repository.

To see each file format in details, see :ref:`config file formats`.

.. warning::
    Usage of ``setup.cfg`` is not recommended except for very simple use cases. ``.cfg``
    files use a different parser than ``pytest.ini`` and ``tox.ini`` which might cause hard to track
    down problems.
    When possible, it is recommended to use the latter files, or ``pyproject.toml``, to hold your pytest configuration.

Configuration options may be overwritten in the command-line by using ``-o/--override-ini``, which can also be
passed multiple times. The expected format is ``name=value``. For example::

   pytest -o console_output_style=classic -o cache_dir=/tmp/mycache


.. confval:: addopts

   Add the specified ``OPTS`` to the set of command line arguments as if they
   had been specified by the user. Example: if you have this ini file content:

   .. code-block:: ini

        # content of pytest.ini
        [pytest]
        addopts = --maxfail=2 -rf  # exit after 2 failures, report fail info

   issuing ``pytest test_hello.py`` actually means:

   .. code-block:: bash

        pytest --maxfail=2 -rf test_hello.py

   Default is to add no options.


.. confval:: cache_dir

   Sets the directory where the cache plugin's content is stored. Default directory is
   ``.pytest_cache`` which is created in :ref:`rootdir <rootdir>`. Directory may be
   relative or absolute path. If setting relative path, then directory is created
   relative to :ref:`rootdir <rootdir>`. Additionally, a path may contain environment
   variables, that will be expanded. For more information about cache plugin
   please refer to :ref:`cache_provider`.

.. confval:: collect_imported_tests

   .. versionadded:: 8.4

   Setting this to ``false`` will make pytest collect classes/functions from test
   files **only** if they are defined in that file (as opposed to imported there).

   .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        collect_imported_tests = false

   Default: ``true``

   pytest traditionally collects classes/functions in the test module namespace even if they are imported from another file.

   For example:

   .. code-block:: python

       # contents of src/domain.py
       class Testament: ...


       # contents of tests/test_testament.py
       from domain import Testament


       def test_testament(): ...

   In this scenario, with the default options, pytest will collect the class `Testament` from `tests/test_testament.py` because it starts with `Test`, even though in this case it is a production class being imported in the test module namespace.

   Set ``collected_imported_tests`` to ``false`` in the configuration file prevents that.

.. confval:: consider_namespace_packages

   Controls if pytest should attempt to identify `namespace packages <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages>`__
   when collecting Python modules. Default is ``False``.

   Set to ``True`` if the package you are testing is part of a namespace package.
   Namespace packages are also supported as ``--pyargs`` target.

   Only `native namespace packages <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#native-namespace-packages>`__
   are supported, with no plans to support `legacy namespace packages <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#legacy-namespace-packages>`__.

   .. versionadded:: 8.1

.. confval:: console_output_style

   Sets the console output style while running tests:

   * ``classic``: classic pytest output.
   * ``progress``: like classic pytest output, but with a progress indicator.
   * ``progress-even-when-capture-no``: allows the use of the progress indicator even when ``capture=no``.
   * ``count``: like progress, but shows progress as the number of tests completed instead of a percent.
   * ``times``: show tests duration.

   The default is ``progress``, but you can fallback to ``classic`` if you prefer or
   the new mode is causing unexpected problems:

   .. code-block:: ini

        # content of pytest.ini
        [pytest]
        console_output_style = classic


.. confval:: disable_test_id_escaping_and_forfeit_all_rights_to_community_support

   .. versionadded:: 4.4

   pytest by default escapes any non-ascii characters used in unicode strings
   for the parametrization because it has several downsides.
   If however you would like to use unicode strings in parametrization
   and see them in the terminal as is (non-escaped), use this option
   in your ``pytest.ini``:

   .. code-block:: ini

       [pytest]
       disable_test_id_escaping_and_forfeit_all_rights_to_community_support = True

   Keep in mind however that this might cause unwanted side effects and
   even bugs depending on the OS used and plugins currently installed,
   so use it at your own risk.

   Default: ``False``.

   See :ref:`parametrizemark`.

.. confval:: doctest_encoding



   Default encoding to use to decode text files with docstrings.
   :ref:`See how pytest handles doctests <doctest>`.


.. confval:: doctest_optionflags

   One or more doctest flag names from the standard ``doctest`` module.
   :ref:`See how pytest handles doctests <doctest>`.


.. confval:: empty_parameter_set_mark



    Allows to pick the action for empty parametersets in parameterization

    * ``skip`` skips tests with an empty parameterset (default)
    * ``xfail`` marks tests with an empty parameterset as xfail(run=False)
    * ``fail_at_collect`` raises an exception if parametrize collects an empty parameter set

    .. code-block:: ini

      # content of pytest.ini
      [pytest]
      empty_parameter_set_mark = xfail

    .. note::

      The default value of this option is planned to change to ``xfail`` in future releases
      as this is considered less error prone, see :issue:`3155` for more details.


.. confval:: faulthandler_timeout

   Dumps the tracebacks of all threads if a test takes longer than ``X`` seconds to run (including
   fixture setup and teardown). Implemented using the :func:`faulthandler.dump_traceback_later` function,
   so all caveats there apply.

   .. code-block:: ini

        # content of pytest.ini
        [pytest]
        faulthandler_timeout=5

   For more information please refer to :ref:`faulthandler`.

.. confval:: filterwarnings



   Sets a list of filters and actions that should be taken for matched
   warnings. By default all warnings emitted during the test session
   will be displayed in a summary at the end of the test session.

   .. code-block:: ini

        # content of pytest.ini
        [pytest]
        filterwarnings =
            error
            ignore::DeprecationWarning

   This tells pytest to ignore deprecation warnings and turn all other warnings
   into errors. For more information please refer to :ref:`warnings`.


.. confval:: junit_duration_report

    .. versionadded:: 4.1

    Configures how durations are recorded into the JUnit XML report:

    * ``total`` (the default): duration times reported include setup, call, and teardown times.
    * ``call``: duration times reported include only call times, excluding setup and teardown.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        junit_duration_report = call


.. confval:: junit_family

    .. versionadded:: 4.2
    .. versionchanged:: 6.1
        Default changed to ``xunit2``.

    Configures the format of the generated JUnit XML file. The possible options are:

    * ``xunit1`` (or ``legacy``): produces old style output, compatible with the xunit 1.0 format.
    * ``xunit2``: produces `xunit 2.0 style output <https://github.com/jenkinsci/xunit-plugin/blob/xunit-2.3.2/src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/xunit/types/model/xsd/junit-10.xsd>`__, which should be more compatible with latest Jenkins versions.  **This is the default**.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        junit_family = xunit2


.. confval:: junit_logging

    .. versionadded:: 3.5
    .. versionchanged:: 5.4
        ``log``, ``all``, ``out-err`` options added.

    Configures if captured output should be written to the JUnit XML file. Valid values are:

    * ``log``: write only ``logging`` captured output.
    * ``system-out``: write captured ``stdout`` contents.
    * ``system-err``: write captured ``stderr`` contents.
    * ``out-err``: write both captured ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` contents.
    * ``all``: write captured ``logging``, ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` contents.
    * ``no`` (the default): no captured output is written.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        junit_logging = system-out


.. confval:: junit_log_passing_tests

    .. versionadded:: 4.6

    If ``junit_logging != "no"``, configures if the captured output should be written
    to the JUnit XML file for **passing** tests. Default is ``True``.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        junit_log_passing_tests = False


.. confval:: junit_suite_name

    To set the name of the root test suite xml item, you can configure the ``junit_suite_name`` option in your config file:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        junit_suite_name = my_suite

.. confval:: log_auto_indent

    Allow selective auto-indentation of multiline log messages.

    Supports command line option ``--log-auto-indent [value]``
    and config option ``log_auto_indent = [value]`` to set the
    auto-indentation behavior for all logging.

    ``[value]`` can be:
        * True or "On" - Dynamically auto-indent multiline log messages
        * False or "Off" or 0 - Do not auto-indent multiline log messages (the default behavior)
        * [positive integer] - auto-indent multiline log messages by [value] spaces

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        log_auto_indent = False

    Supports passing kwarg ``extra={"auto_indent": [value]}`` to
    calls to ``logging.log()`` to specify auto-indentation behavior for
    a specific entry in the log. ``extra`` kwarg overrides the value specified
    on the command line or in the config.

.. confval:: log_cli

    Enable log display during test run (also known as :ref:`"live logging" <live_logs>`).
    The default is ``False``.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        log_cli = True

.. confval:: log_cli_date_format



    Sets a :py:func:`time.strftime`-compatible string that will be used when formatting dates for live logging.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        log_cli_date_format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S

    For more information, see :ref:`live_logs`.

.. confval:: log_cli_format



    Sets a :py:mod:`logging`-compatible string used to format live logging messages.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        log_cli_format = %(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s

    For more information, see :ref:`live_logs`.


.. confval:: log_cli_level



    Sets the minimum log message level that should be captured for live logging. The integer value or
    the names of the levels can be used.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        log_cli_level = INFO

    For more information, see :ref:`live_logs`.


.. confval:: log_date_format



    Sets a :py:func:`time.strftime`-compatible string that will be used when formatting dates for logging capture.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        log_date_format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S

    For more information, see :ref:`logging`.


.. confval:: log_file



    Sets a file name relative to the current working directory where log messages should be written to, in addition
    to the other logging facilities that are active.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        log_file = logs/pytest-logs.txt

    For more information, see :ref:`logging`.


.. confval:: log_file_date_format



    Sets a :py:func:`time.strftime`-compatible string that will be used when formatting dates for the logging file.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        log_file_date_format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S

    For more information, see :ref:`logging`.

.. confval:: log_file_format



    Sets a :py:mod:`logging`-compatible string used to format logging messages redirected to the logging file.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        log_file_format = %(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s

    For more information, see :ref:`logging`.

.. confval:: log_file_level



    Sets the minimum log message level that should be captured for the logging file. The integer value or
    the names of the levels can be used.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        log_file_level = INFO

    For more information, see :ref:`logging`.


.. confval:: log_format



    Sets a :py:mod:`logging`-compatible string used to format captured logging messages.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        log_format = %(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s

    For more information, see :ref:`logging`.


.. confval:: log_level



    Sets the minimum log message level that should be captured for logging capture. The integer value or
    the names of the levels can be used.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        log_level = INFO

    For more information, see :ref:`logging`.


.. confval:: markers

    When the ``--strict-markers`` or ``--strict`` command-line arguments are used,
    only known markers - defined in code by core pytest or some plugin - are allowed.

    You can list additional markers in this setting to add them to the whitelist,
    in which case you probably want to add ``--strict-markers`` to ``addopts``
    to avoid future regressions:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        addopts = --strict-markers
        markers =
            slow
            serial

    .. note::
        The use of ``--strict-markers`` is highly preferred. ``--strict`` was kept for
        backward compatibility only and may be confusing for others as it only applies to
        markers and not to other options.

.. confval:: minversion

   Specifies a minimal pytest version required for running tests.

   .. code-block:: ini

        # content of pytest.ini
        [pytest]
        minversion = 3.0  # will fail if we run with pytest-2.8


.. confval:: norecursedirs

   Set the directory basename patterns to avoid when recursing
   for test discovery.  The individual (fnmatch-style) patterns are
   applied to the basename of a directory to decide if to recurse into it.
   Pattern matching characters::

        *       matches everything
        ?       matches any single character
        [seq]   matches any character in seq
        [!seq]  matches any char not in seq

   Default patterns are ``'*.egg'``, ``'.*'``, ``'_darcs'``, ``'build'``,
   ``'CVS'``, ``'dist'``, ``'node_modules'``, ``'venv'``, ``'{arch}'``.
   Setting a ``norecursedirs`` replaces the default.  Here is an example of
   how to avoid certain directories:

   .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        norecursedirs = .svn _build tmp*

   This would tell ``pytest`` to not look into typical subversion or
   sphinx-build directories or into any ``tmp`` prefixed directory.

   Additionally, ``pytest`` will attempt to intelligently identify and ignore
   a virtualenv.  Any directory deemed to be the root of a virtual environment
   will not be considered during test collection unless
   ``--collect-in-virtualenv`` is given.  Note also that ``norecursedirs``
   takes precedence over ``--collect-in-virtualenv``; e.g. if you intend to
   run tests in a virtualenv with a base directory that matches ``'.*'`` you
   *must* override ``norecursedirs`` in addition to using the
   ``--collect-in-virtualenv`` flag.


.. confval:: python_classes

   One or more name prefixes or glob-style patterns determining which classes
   are considered for test collection. Search for multiple glob patterns by
   adding a space between patterns. By default, pytest will consider any
   class prefixed with ``Test`` as a test collection.  Here is an example of how
   to collect tests from classes that end in ``Suite``:

   .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        python_classes = *Suite

   Note that ``unittest.TestCase`` derived classes are always collected
   regardless of this option, as ``unittest``'s own collection framework is used
   to collect those tests.


.. confval:: python_files

   One or more Glob-style file patterns determining which python files
   are considered as test modules. Search for multiple glob patterns by
   adding a space between patterns:

   .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        python_files = test_*.py check_*.py example_*.py

   Or one per line:

   .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        python_files =
            test_*.py
            check_*.py
            example_*.py

   By default, files matching ``test_*.py`` and ``*_test.py`` will be considered
   test modules.


.. confval:: python_functions

   One or more name prefixes or glob-patterns determining which test functions
   and methods are considered tests. Search for multiple glob patterns by
   adding a space between patterns. By default, pytest will consider any
   function prefixed with ``test`` as a test.  Here is an example of how
   to collect test functions and methods that end in ``_test``:

   .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        python_functions = *_test

   Note that this has no effect on methods that live on a ``unittest.TestCase``
   derived class, as ``unittest``'s own collection framework is used
   to collect those tests.

   See :ref:`change naming conventions` for more detailed examples.


.. confval:: pythonpath

   Sets list of directories that should be added to the python search path.
   Directories will be added to the head of :data:`sys.path`.
   Similar to the :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` environment variable, the directories will be
   included in where Python will look for imported modules.
   Paths are relative to the :ref:`rootdir <rootdir>` directory.
   Directories remain in path for the duration of the test session.

   .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        pythonpath = src1 src2


.. confval:: required_plugins

   A space separated list of plugins that must be present for pytest to run.
   Plugins can be listed with or without version specifiers directly following
   their name. Whitespace between different version specifiers is not allowed.
   If any one of the plugins is not found, emit an error.

   .. code-block:: ini

       [pytest]
       required_plugins = pytest-django>=3.0.0,<4.0.0 pytest-html pytest-xdist>=1.0.0


.. confval:: testpaths

   Sets list of directories that should be searched for tests when
   no specific directories, files or test ids are given in the command line when
   executing pytest from the :ref:`rootdir <rootdir>` directory.
   File system paths may use shell-style wildcards, including the recursive
   ``**`` pattern.

   Useful when all project tests are in a known location to speed up
   test collection and to avoid picking up undesired tests by accident.

   .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        testpaths = testing doc

   This configuration means that executing:

   .. code-block:: console

       pytest

   has the same practical effects as executing:

   .. code-block:: console

       pytest testing doc

.. confval:: tmp_path_retention_count

   How many sessions should we keep the `tmp_path` directories,
   according to `tmp_path_retention_policy`.

   .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        tmp_path_retention_count = 3

   Default: ``3``


.. confval:: tmp_path_retention_policy



   Controls which directories created by the `tmp_path` fixture are kept around,
   based on test outcome.

    * `all`: retains directories for all tests, regardless of the outcome.
    * `failed`: retains directories only for tests with outcome `error` or `failed`.
    * `none`: directories are always removed after each test ends, regardless of the outcome.

   .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        tmp_path_retention_policy = all

   Default: ``all``


.. confval:: truncation_limit_chars

   Controls maximum number of characters to truncate assertion message contents.

   Setting value to ``0`` disables the character limit for truncation.

   .. code-block:: ini

       [pytest]
       truncation_limit_chars = 640

   pytest truncates the assert messages to a certain limit by default to prevent comparison with large data to overload the console output.

   Default: ``640``

   .. note::

        If pytest detects it is :ref:`running on CI <ci-pipelines>`, truncation is disabled automatically.


.. confval:: truncation_limit_lines

   Controls maximum number of linesto truncate assertion message contents.

   Setting value to ``0`` disables the lines limit for truncation.

   .. code-block:: ini

       [pytest]
       truncation_limit_lines = 8

   pytest truncates the assert messages to a certain limit by default to prevent comparison with large data to overload the console output.

   Default: ``8``

   .. note::

        If pytest detects it is :ref:`running on CI <ci-pipelines>`, truncation is disabled automatically.


.. confval:: usefixtures

    List of fixtures that will be applied to all test functions; this is semantically the same to apply
    the ``@pytest.mark.usefixtures`` marker to all test functions.


    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        usefixtures =
            clean_db


.. confval:: verbosity_assertions

    Set a verbosity level specifically for assertion related output, overriding the application wide level.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        verbosity_assertions = 2

    Defaults to application wide verbosity level (via the ``-v`` command-line option). A special value of
    "auto" can be used to explicitly use the global verbosity level.


.. confval:: verbosity_test_cases

    Set a verbosity level specifically for test case execution related output, overriding the application wide level.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        verbosity_test_cases = 2

    Defaults to application wide verbosity level (via the ``-v`` command-line option). A special value of
    "auto" can be used to explicitly use the global verbosity level.


.. confval:: xfail_strict

    If set to ``True``, tests marked with ``@pytest.mark.xfail`` that actually succeed will by default fail the
    test suite.
    For more information, see :ref:`xfail strict tutorial`.


    .. code-block:: ini

        [pytest]
        xfail_strict = True


.. _`command-line-flags`:

Command-line Flags
------------------

All the command-line flags can be obtained by running ``pytest --help``::

    $ pytest --help
    usage: pytest [options] [file_or_dir] [file_or_dir] [...]

    positional arguments:
      file_or_dir

    general:
      -k EXPRESSION         Only run tests which match the given substring
                            expression. An expression is a Python evaluable
                            expression where all names are substring-matched
                            against test names and their parent classes.
                            Example: -k 'test_method or test_other' matches all
                            test functions and classes whose name contains
                            'test_method' or 'test_other', while -k 'not
                            test_method' matches those that don't contain
                            'test_method' in their names. -k 'not test_method
                            and not test_other' will eliminate the matches.
                            Additionally keywords are matched to classes and
                            functions containing extra names in their
                            'extra_keyword_matches' set, as well as functions
                            which have names assigned directly to them. The
                            matching is case-insensitive.
      -m MARKEXPR           Only run tests matching given mark expression. For
                            example: -m 'mark1 and not mark2'.
      --markers             show markers (builtin, plugin and per-project ones).
      -x, --exitfirst       Exit instantly on first error or failed test
      --maxfail=num         Exit after first num failures or errors
      --strict-config       Any warnings encountered while parsing the `pytest`
                            section of the configuration file raise errors
      --strict-markers      Markers not registered in the `markers` section of
                            the configuration file raise errors
      --strict              (Deprecated) alias to --strict-markers
      --fixtures, --funcargs
                            Show available fixtures, sorted by plugin appearance
                            (fixtures with leading '_' are only shown with '-v')
      --fixtures-per-test   Show fixtures per test
      --pdb                 Start the interactive Python debugger on errors or
                            KeyboardInterrupt
      --pdbcls=modulename:classname
                            Specify a custom interactive Python debugger for use
                            with --pdb.For example:
                            --pdbcls=IPython.terminal.debugger:TerminalPdb
      --trace               Immediately break when running each test
      --capture=method      Per-test capturing method: one of fd|sys|no|tee-sys
      -s                    Shortcut for --capture=no
      --runxfail            Report the results of xfail tests as if they were
                            not marked
      --lf, --last-failed   Rerun only the tests that failed at the last run (or
                            all if none failed)
      --ff, --failed-first  Run all tests, but run the last failures first. This
                            may re-order tests and thus lead to repeated fixture
                            setup/teardown.
      --nf, --new-first     Run tests from new files first, then the rest of the
                            tests sorted by file mtime
      --cache-show=[CACHESHOW]
                            Show cache contents, don't perform collection or
                            tests. Optional argument: glob (default: '*').
      --cache-clear         Remove all cache contents at start of test run
      --lfnf, --last-failed-no-failures={all,none}
                            With ``--lf``, determines whether to execute tests
                            when there are no previously (known) failures or
                            when no cached ``lastfailed`` data was found.
                            ``all`` (the default) runs the full test suite
                            again. ``none`` just emits a message about no known
                            failures and exits successfully.
      --sw, --stepwise      Exit on test failure and continue from last failing
                            test next time
      --sw-skip, --stepwise-skip
                            Ignore the first failing test but stop on the next
                            failing test. Implicitly enables --stepwise.
      --sw-reset, --stepwise-reset
                            Resets stepwise state, restarting the stepwise
                            workflow. Implicitly enables --stepwise.

    Reporting:
      --durations=N         Show N slowest setup/test durations (N=0 for all)
      --durations-min=N     Minimal duration in seconds for inclusion in slowest
                            list. Default: 0.005 (or 0.0 if -vv is given).

      --force-short-summary
                            Force condensed summary output regardless of
                            verbosity level.
      -q, --quiet           Decrease verbosity
      --verbosity=VERBOSE   Set verbosity. Default: 0.
      -r chars              Show extra test summary info as specified by chars:

                            (p)assed, (P)assed with output, (a)ll except passed
                            (p/P), or (A)ll. (w)arnings are enabled by default
                            (see --disable-warnings), 'N' can be used to reset
                            the list. (default: 'fE').
      --disable-warnings, --disable-pytest-warnings
                            Disable warnings summary
      -l, --showlocals      Show locals in tracebacks (disabled by default)
      --no-showlocals       Hide locals in tracebacks (negate --showlocals
                            passed through addopts)
      --tb=style            Traceback print mode
                            (auto/long/short/line/native/no)
      --xfail-tb            Show tracebacks for xfail (as long as --tb != no)
      --show-capture={no,stdout,stderr,log,all}
                            Controls how captured stdout/stderr/log is shown on
                            failed tests. Default: all.
      --full-trace          Don't cut any tracebacks (default is to cut)
      --color=color         Color terminal output (yes/no/auto)

April 2015 is "adopt pytest month"
=============================================

Are you an enthusiastic pytest user, the local testing guru in your workplace? Or are you considering using pytest for your open source project, but not sure how to get started? Then you may be interested in "adopt pytest month"!

We will pair experienced pytest users with open source projects, for a month's effort of getting new development teams started with pytest.

In 2015 we are trying this for the first time. In February and March 2015 we will gather volunteers on both sides, in April we will do the work, and in May we will evaluate how it went. This effort is being coordinated by Brianna Laugher. If you have any questions or comments, you can raise them on the `@pytestdotorg twitter account <https://twitter.com/pytestdotorg>`_\, the :issue:`issue tracker <676>` or the `pytest-dev mailing list`_.


.. _`pytest-dev mailing list`: https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pytest-dev


The ideal pytest helper
-----------------------------------------

 - will be able to commit 2-4 hours a week to working with their particular project (this might involve joining their mailing list, installing the software and exploring any existing tests, offering advice, writing some example tests)
 - feels confident in using pytest (e.g. has explored command line options, knows how to write parametrized tests, has an idea about conftest contents)
 - does not need to be an expert in every aspect!

Pytest helpers, sign up here! (preferably in February, hard deadline 22 March)



The ideal partner project
-----------------------------------------

 - is open source, and predominantly written in Python
 - has an automated/documented install process for developers
 - has more than one core developer
 - has at least one official release (e.g. is available on pypi)
 - has the support of the core development team, in trying out pytest adoption
 - has no tests... or 100% test coverage... or somewhere in between!

Partner projects, sign up here! (by 22 March)



What does it mean to "adopt pytest"?
-----------------------------------------

There can be many different definitions of "success". Pytest can run many unittest_ tests by default, so using pytest as your testrunner may be possible from day 1. Job done, right?

Progressive success might look like:

 - tests can be run (by pytest) without errors (there may be failures)
 - tests can be run (by pytest) without failures
 - test runner is integrated into CI server
 - existing tests are rewritten to take advantage of pytest features - this can happen in several iterations, for example:
    - changing to native assert_ statements (pycmd_ has a script to help with that, ``pyconvert_unittest.py``)
    - changing `setUp/tearDown methods`_ to fixtures_
    - adding markers_
    - other changes to reduce boilerplate
 - assess needs for future tests to be written, e.g. new fixtures, distributed_ testing tweaks

"Success" should also include that the development team feels comfortable with their knowledge of how to use pytest. In fact this is probably more important than anything else. So spending a lot of time on communication, giving examples, etc will probably be important - both in running the tests, and in writing them.

It may be after the month is up, the partner project decides that pytest is not right for it. That's okay - hopefully the pytest team will also learn something about its weaknesses or deficiencies.

.. _backwards-compatibility:

Backwards Compatibility Policy
==============================

.. versionadded: 6.0

Pytest is an actively evolving project that has been decades in the making.
We keep learning about new and better structures to express different details about testing.

While we implement those modifications, we try to ensure an easy transition and don't want to impose unnecessary churn on our users and community/plugin authors.

As of now, pytest considers multiple types of backward compatibility transitions:

a) trivial: APIs that trivially translate to the new mechanism and do not cause problematic changes.

   We try to support those indefinitely while encouraging users to switch to newer or better mechanisms through documentation.

b) transitional: the old and new APIs don't conflict, and we can help users transition by using warnings while supporting both for a prolonged period of time.

   We will only start the removal of deprecated functionality in major releases (e.g., if we deprecate something in 3.0, we will start to remove it in 4.0), and keep it around for at least two minor releases (e.g., if we deprecate something in 3.9 and 4.0 is the next release, we start to remove it in 5.0, not in 4.0).

   A deprecated feature scheduled to be removed in major version X will use the warning class `PytestRemovedInXWarning` (a subclass of :class:`~pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning`).

   When the deprecation expires (e.g., 4.0 is released), we won't remove the deprecated functionality immediately but will use the standard warning filters to turn `PytestRemovedInXWarning` (e.g., `PytestRemovedIn4Warning`) into **errors** by default. This approach makes it explicit that removal is imminent and still gives you time to turn the deprecated feature into a warning instead of an error so it can be dealt with in your own time. In the next minor release (e.g., 4.1), the feature will be effectively removed.

c) True breakage should only be considered when a normal transition is unreasonably unsustainable and would offset important developments or features by years. In addition, they should be limited to APIs where the number of actual users is very small (for example, only impacting some plugins) and can be coordinated with the community in advance.

   Examples for such upcoming changes:

   * removal of ``pytest_runtest_protocol/nextitem`` - :issue:`895`
   * rearranging of the node tree to include ``FunctionDefinition``
   * rearranging of ``SetupState`` :issue:`895`

   True breakages must be announced first in an issue containing:

   * Detailed description of the change
   * Rationale
   * Expected impact on users and plugin authors (example in :issue:`895`)

   After there's no hard *-1* on the issue it should be followed up by an initial proof-of-concept Pull Request.

   This POC serves as both a coordination point to assess impact and potential inspiration to come up with a transitional solution after all.

   After a reasonable amount of time the PR can be merged to base a new major release.

   For the PR to mature from POC to acceptance, it must contain:
   * Setup of deprecation errors/warnings that help users fix and port their code. If it is possible to introduce a deprecation period under the current series, before the true breakage, it should be introduced in a separate PR and be part of the current release stream.
   * Detailed description of the rationale and examples on how to port code in ``doc/en/deprecations.rst``.


History
=========


Focus primary on smooth transition - stance (pre 6.0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keeping backwards compatibility has a very high priority in the pytest project. Although we have deprecated functionality over the years, most of it is still supported. All deprecations in pytest were done because simpler or more efficient ways of accomplishing the same tasks have emerged, making the old way of doing things unnecessary.

With the pytest 3.0 release, we introduced a clear communication scheme for when we will actually remove the old busted joint and politely ask you to use the new hotness instead, while giving you enough time to adjust your tests or raise concerns if there are valid reasons to keep deprecated functionality around.

To communicate changes, we issue deprecation warnings using a custom warning hierarchy (see :ref:`internal-warnings`). These warnings may be suppressed using the standard means: ``-W`` command-line flag or ``filterwarnings`` ini options (see :ref:`warnings`), but we suggest to use these sparingly and temporarily, and heed the warnings when possible.

We will only start the removal of deprecated functionality in major releases (e.g. if we deprecate something in 3.0, we will start to remove it in 4.0), and keep it around for at least two minor releases (e.g. if we deprecate something in 3.9 and 4.0 is the next release, we start to remove it in 5.0, not in 4.0).

When the deprecation expires (e.g. 4.0 is released), we won't remove the deprecated functionality immediately, but will use the standard warning filters to turn them into **errors** by default. This approach makes it explicit that removal is imminent, and still gives you time to turn the deprecated feature into a warning instead of an error so it can be dealt with in your own time. In the next minor release (e.g. 4.1), the feature will be effectively removed.


Deprecation Roadmap
-------------------

Features currently deprecated and removed in previous releases can be found in :ref:`deprecations`.

We track future deprecation and removal of features using milestones and the `deprecation <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues?q=label%3A%22type%3A+deprecation%22>`_ and `removal <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/labels/type%3A%20removal>`_ labels on GitHub.

Pytest API and builtin fixtures
================================================


Most of the information of this page has been moved over to :ref:`api-reference`.

For information on plugin hooks and objects, see :ref:`plugins`.

For information on the ``pytest.mark`` mechanism, see :ref:`mark`.

For information about fixtures, see :ref:`fixtures`. To see a complete list of available fixtures (add ``-v`` to also see fixtures with leading ``_``), type :

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest  --fixtures -v
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python
    cachedir: .pytest_cache
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 0 items
    cache -- .../_pytest/cacheprovider.py:555
        Return a cache object that can persist state between testing sessions.

        cache.get(key, default)
        cache.set(key, value)

        Keys must be ``/`` separated strings, where the first part is usually the
        name of your plugin or application to avoid clashes with other cache users.

        Values can be any object handled by the json stdlib module.

    capsys -- .../_pytest/capture.py:1000
        Enable text capturing of writes to ``sys.stdout`` and ``sys.stderr``.

        The captured output is made available via ``capsys.readouterr()`` method
        calls, which return a ``(out, err)`` namedtuple.
        ``out`` and ``err`` will be ``text`` objects.

        Returns an instance of :class:`CaptureFixture[str] <pytest.CaptureFixture>`.

        Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            def test_output(capsys):
                print("hello")
                captured = capsys.readouterr()
                assert captured.out == "hello\n"

    capteesys -- .../_pytest/capture.py:1028
        Enable simultaneous text capturing and pass-through of writes
        to ``sys.stdout`` and ``sys.stderr`` as defined by ``--capture=``.


        The captured output is made available via ``capteesys.readouterr()`` method
        calls, which return a ``(out, err)`` namedtuple.
        ``out`` and ``err`` will be ``text`` objects.

        The output is also passed-through, allowing it to be "live-printed",
        reported, or both as defined by ``--capture=``.

        Returns an instance of :class:`CaptureFixture[str] <pytest.CaptureFixture>`.

        Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            def test_output(capteesys):
                print("hello")
                captured = capteesys.readouterr()
                assert captured.out == "hello\n"

    capsysbinary -- .../_pytest/capture.py:1063
        Enable bytes capturing of writes to ``sys.stdout`` and ``sys.stderr``.

        The captured output is made available via ``capsysbinary.readouterr()``
        method calls, which return a ``(out, err)`` namedtuple.
        ``out`` and ``err`` will be ``bytes`` objects.

        Returns an instance of :class:`CaptureFixture[bytes] <pytest.CaptureFixture>`.

        Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            def test_output(capsysbinary):
                print("hello")
                captured = capsysbinary.readouterr()
                assert captured.out == b"hello\n"

    capfd -- .../_pytest/capture.py:1091
        Enable text capturing of writes to file descriptors ``1`` and ``2``.

        The captured output is made available via ``capfd.readouterr()`` method
        calls, which return a ``(out, err)`` namedtuple.
        ``out`` and ``err`` will be ``text`` objects.

        Returns an instance of :class:`CaptureFixture[str] <pytest.CaptureFixture>`.

        Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            def test_system_echo(capfd):
                os.system('echo "hello"')
                captured = capfd.readouterr()
                assert captured.out == "hello\n"

    capfdbinary -- .../_pytest/capture.py:1119
        Enable bytes capturing of writes to file descriptors ``1`` and ``2``.

        The captured output is made available via ``capfd.readouterr()`` method
        calls, which return a ``(out, err)`` namedtuple.
        ``out`` and ``err`` will be ``byte`` objects.

        Returns an instance of :class:`CaptureFixture[bytes] <pytest.CaptureFixture>`.

        Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            def test_system_echo(capfdbinary):
                os.system('echo "hello"')
                captured = capfdbinary.readouterr()
                assert captured.out == b"hello\n"

    doctest_namespace [session scope] -- .../_pytest/doctest.py:740
        Fixture that returns a :py:class:`dict` that will be injected into the
        namespace of doctests.

        Usually this fixture is used in conjunction with another ``autouse`` fixture:

        .. code-block:: python

            @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
            def add_np(doctest_namespace):
                doctest_namespace["np"] = numpy

        For more details: :ref:`doctest_namespace`.

    pytestconfig [session scope] -- .../_pytest/fixtures.py:1424
        Session-scoped fixture that returns the session's :class:`pytest.Config`
        object.

        Example::

            def test_foo(pytestconfig):
                if pytestconfig.get_verbosity() > 0:
                    ...

    record_property -- .../_pytest/junitxml.py:277
        Add extra properties to the calling test.

        User properties become part of the test report and are available to the
        configured reporters, like JUnit XML.

        The fixture is callable with ``name, value``. The value is automatically
        XML-encoded.

        Example::

            def test_function(record_property):
                record_property("example_key", 1)

    record_xml_attribute -- .../_pytest/junitxml.py:300
        Add extra xml attributes to the tag for the calling test.

        The fixture is callable with ``name, value``. The value is
        automatically XML-encoded.

    record_testsuite_property [session scope] -- .../_pytest/junitxml.py:338
        Record a new ``<property>`` tag as child of the root ``<testsuite>``.

        This is suitable to writing global information regarding the entire test
        suite, and is compatible with ``xunit2`` JUnit family.

        This is a ``session``-scoped fixture which is called with ``(name, value)``. Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            def test_foo(record_testsuite_property):
                record_testsuite_property("ARCH", "PPC")
                record_testsuite_property("STORAGE_TYPE", "CEPH")

        :param name:
            The property name.
        :param value:
            The property value. Will be converted to a string.

        .. warning::

            Currently this fixture **does not work** with the
            `pytest-xdist <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist>`__ plugin. See
            :issue:`7767` for details.

    tmpdir_factory [session scope] -- .../_pytest/legacypath.py:298
        Return a :class:`pytest.TempdirFactory` instance for the test session.

    tmpdir -- .../_pytest/legacypath.py:305
        Return a temporary directory (as `legacy_path`_ object)
        which is unique to each test function invocation.
        The temporary directory is created as a subdirectory
        of the base temporary directory, with configurable retention,
        as discussed in :ref:`temporary directory location and retention`.

        .. note::
            These days, it is preferred to use ``tmp_path``.

            :ref:`About the tmpdir and tmpdir_factory fixtures<tmpdir and tmpdir_factory>`.

        .. _legacy_path: https://py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/path.html

    caplog -- .../_pytest/logging.py:596
        Access and control log capturing.

        Captured logs are available through the following properties/methods::

        * caplog.messages        -> list of format-interpolated log messages
        * caplog.text            -> string containing formatted log output
        * caplog.records         -> list of logging.LogRecord instances
        * caplog.record_tuples   -> list of (logger_name, level, message) tuples
        * caplog.clear()         -> clear captured records and formatted log output string

    monkeypatch -- .../_pytest/monkeypatch.py:31
        A convenient fixture for monkey-patching.

        The fixture provides these methods to modify objects, dictionaries, or
        :data:`os.environ`:

        * :meth:`monkeypatch.setattr(obj, name, value, raising=True) <pytest.MonkeyPatch.setattr>`
        * :meth:`monkeypatch.delattr(obj, name, raising=True) <pytest.MonkeyPatch.delattr>`
        * :meth:`monkeypatch.setitem(mapping, name, value) <pytest.MonkeyPatch.setitem>`
        * :meth:`monkeypatch.delitem(obj, name, raising=True) <pytest.MonkeyPatch.delitem>`
        * :meth:`monkeypatch.setenv(name, value, prepend=None) <pytest.MonkeyPatch.setenv>`
        * :meth:`monkeypatch.delenv(name, raising=True) <pytest.MonkeyPatch.delenv>`
        * :meth:`monkeypatch.syspath_prepend(path) <pytest.MonkeyPatch.syspath_prepend>`
        * :meth:`monkeypatch.chdir(path) <pytest.MonkeyPatch.chdir>`
        * :meth:`monkeypatch.context() <pytest.MonkeyPatch.context>`

        All modifications will be undone after the requesting test function or
        fixture has finished. The ``raising`` parameter determines if a :class:`KeyError`
        or :class:`AttributeError` will be raised if the set/deletion operation does not have the
        specified target.

        To undo modifications done by the fixture in a contained scope,
        use :meth:`context() <pytest.MonkeyPatch.context>`.

    recwarn -- .../_pytest/recwarn.py:34
        Return a :class:`WarningsRecorder` instance that records all warnings emitted by test functions.

        See :ref:`warnings` for information on warning categories.

    tmp_path_factory [session scope] -- .../_pytest/tmpdir.py:240
        Return a :class:`pytest.TempPathFactory` instance for the test session.

    tmp_path -- .../_pytest/tmpdir.py:255
        Return a temporary directory (as :class:`pathlib.Path` object)
        which is unique to each test function invocation.
        The temporary directory is created as a subdirectory
        of the base temporary directory, with configurable retention,
        as discussed in :ref:`temporary directory location and retention`.

pytest 8.4.1 (2025-06-17)
=========================

Bug fixes
---------

- `#13461 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13461>`_: Corrected ``_pytest.terminal.TerminalReporter.isatty`` to support
  being called as a method. Before it was just a boolean which could
  break correct code when using ``-o log_cli=true``).


- `#13477 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13477>`_: Reintroduced :class:`pytest.PytestReturnNotNoneWarning` which was removed by accident in pytest `8.4`.

  This warning is raised when a test functions returns a value other than ``None``, which is often a mistake made by beginners.

  See :ref:`return-not-none` for more information.


- `#13497 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13497>`_: Fixed compatibility with ``Twisted 25+``.



Improved documentation
----------------------

- `#13492 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13492>`_: Fixed outdated warning about ``faulthandler`` not working on Windows.


pytest 8.4.0 (2025-06-02)
=========================

Removals and backward incompatible breaking changes
---------------------------------------------------

- `#11372 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11372>`_: Async tests will now fail, instead of warning+skipping, if you don't have any suitable plugin installed.


- `#12346 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12346>`_: Tests will now fail, instead of raising a warning, if they return any value other than None.


- `#12874 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12874>`_: We dropped support for Python 3.8 following its end of life (2024-10-07).


- `#12960 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12960>`_: Test functions containing a yield now cause an explicit error. They have not been run since pytest 4.0, and were previously marked as an expected failure and deprecation warning.

  See :ref:`the docs <yield tests deprecated>` for more information.



Deprecations (removal in next major release)
--------------------------------------------

- `#10839 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10839>`_: Requesting an asynchronous fixture without a `pytest_fixture_setup` hook that resolves it will now give a DeprecationWarning. This most commonly happens if a sync test requests an async fixture. This should have no effect on a majority of users with async tests or fixtures using async pytest plugins, but may affect non-standard hook setups or ``autouse=True``. For guidance on how to work around this warning see :ref:`sync-test-async-fixture`.



New features
------------

- `#11538 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11538>`_: Added :class:`pytest.RaisesGroup` as an equivalent to :func:`pytest.raises` for expecting :exc:`ExceptionGroup`. Also adds :class:`pytest.RaisesExc` which is now the logic behind :func:`pytest.raises` and used as parameter to :class:`pytest.RaisesGroup`. ``RaisesGroup`` includes the ability to specify multiple different expected exceptions, the structure of nested exception groups, and flags for emulating :ref:`except* <except_star>`. See :ref:`assert-matching-exception-groups` and docstrings for more information.


- `#12081 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12081>`_: Added :fixture:`capteesys` to capture AND pass output to next handler set by ``--capture=``.


- `#12504 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12504>`_: :func:`pytest.mark.xfail` now accepts :class:`pytest.RaisesGroup` for the ``raises`` parameter when you expect an exception group. You can also pass a :class:`pytest.RaisesExc` if you e.g. want to make use of the ``check`` parameter.


- `#12713 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12713>`_: New `--force-short-summary` option to force condensed summary output regardless of verbosity level.

  This lets users still see condensed summary output of failures for quick reference in log files from job outputs, being especially useful if non-condensed output is very verbose.


- `#12749 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12749>`_: pytest traditionally collects classes/functions in the test module namespace even if they are imported from another file.

  For example:

  .. code-block:: python

      # contents of src/domain.py
      class Testament: ...


      # contents of tests/test_testament.py
      from domain import Testament


      def test_testament(): ...

  In this scenario with the default options, pytest will collect the class `Testament` from `tests/test_testament.py` because it starts with `Test`, even though in this case it is a production class being imported in the test module namespace.

  This behavior can now be prevented by setting the new :confval:`collect_imported_tests` configuration option to ``false``, which will make pytest collect classes/functions from test files **only** if they are defined in that file.

  -- by :user:`FreerGit`


- `#12765 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12765>`_: Thresholds to trigger snippet truncation can now be set with :confval:`truncation_limit_lines` and :confval:`truncation_limit_chars`.

  See :ref:`truncation-params` for more information.


- `#13125 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13125>`_: :confval:`console_output_style` now supports ``times`` to show execution time of each test.


- `#13192 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13192>`_: :func:`pytest.raises` will now raise a warning when passing an empty string to ``match``, as this will match against any value. Use ``match="^$"`` if you want to check that an exception has no message.


- `#13192 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13192>`_: :func:`pytest.raises` will now print a helpful string diff if matching fails and the match parameter has ``^`` and ``$`` and is otherwise escaped.


- `#13192 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13192>`_: You can now pass :func:`with pytest.raises(check=fn): <pytest.raises>`, where ``fn`` is a function which takes a raised exception and returns a boolean. The ``raises`` fails if no exception was raised (as usual), passes if an exception is raised and ``fn`` returns ``True`` (as well as ``match`` and the type matching, if specified, which are checked before), and propagates the exception if ``fn`` returns ``False`` (which likely also fails the test).


- `#13228 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13228>`_: :ref:`hidden-param` can now be used in ``id`` of :func:`pytest.param` or in
  ``ids`` of :py:func:`Metafunc.parametrize <pytest.Metafunc.parametrize>`.
  It hides the parameter set from the test name.


- `#13253 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13253>`_: New flag: :ref:`--disable-plugin-autoload <disable_plugin_autoload>` which works as an alternative to :envvar:`PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD` when setting environment variables is inconvenient; and allows setting it in config files with :confval:`addopts`.



Improvements in existing functionality
--------------------------------------

- `#10224 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10224>`_: pytest's ``short`` and ``long`` traceback styles (:ref:`how-to-modifying-python-tb-printing`)
  now have partial :pep:`657` support and will show specific code segments in the
  traceback.

- `#11118 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11118>`_: Now :confval:`pythonpath` configures `$PYTHONPATH` earlier than before during the initialization process, which now also affects plugins loaded via the `-p` command-line option.

  -- by :user:`millerdev`


- `#11381 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11381>`_: The ``type`` parameter of the ``parser.addini`` method now accepts `"int"` and ``"float"`` parameters, facilitating the parsing of configuration values in the configuration file.

  Example:

  .. code-block:: python

    def pytest_addoption(parser):
        parser.addini("int_value", type="int", default=2, help="my int value")
        parser.addini("float_value", type="float", default=4.2, help="my float value")

  The `pytest.ini` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    int_value = 3
    float_value = 5.4


- `#11525 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11525>`_: Fixtures are now clearly represented in the output as a "fixture object", not as a normal function as before, making it easy for beginners to catch mistakes such as referencing a fixture declared in the same module but not requested in the test function.

  -- by :user:`the-compiler` and :user:`glyphack`


- `#12426 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12426>`_: A warning is now issued when :ref:`pytest.mark.usefixtures ref` is used without specifying any fixtures. Previously, empty usefixtures markers were silently ignored.


- `#12707 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12707>`_: Exception chains can be navigated when dropped into Pdb in Python 3.13+.


- `#12736 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12736>`_: Added a new attribute `name` with the fixed value `"pytest tests"` to the root tag `testsuites` of the junit-xml generated by pytest.

  This attribute is part of many junit-xml specifications and is even part of the `junit-10.xsd` specification that pytest's implementation is based on.


- `#12943 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12943>`_: If a test fails with an exceptiongroup with a single exception, the contained exception will now be displayed in the short test summary info.


- `#12958 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12958>`_: A number of :ref:`unraisable <unraisable>` enhancements:

  * Set the unraisable hook as early as possible and unset it as late as possible, to collect the most possible number of unraisable exceptions.
  * Call the garbage collector just before unsetting the unraisable hook, to collect any straggling exceptions.
  * Collect multiple unraisable exceptions per test phase.
  * Report the :mod:`tracemalloc` allocation traceback (if available).
  * Avoid using a generator based hook to allow handling :class:`StopIteration` in test failures.
  * Report the unraisable exception as the cause of the :class:`pytest.PytestUnraisableExceptionWarning` exception if raised.
  * Compute the ``repr`` of the unraisable object in the unraisable hook so you get the latest information if available, and should help with resurrection of the object.


- `#13010 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13010>`_: :func:`pytest.approx` now can compare collections that contain numbers and non-numbers mixed.


- `#13016 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13016>`_: A number of :ref:`threadexception <unraisable>` enhancements:

  * Set the excepthook as early as possible and unset it as late as possible, to collect the most possible number of unhandled exceptions from threads.
  * Collect multiple thread exceptions per test phase.
  * Report the :mod:`tracemalloc` allocation traceback (if available).
  * Avoid using a generator based hook to allow handling :class:`StopIteration` in test failures.
  * Report the thread exception as the cause of the :class:`pytest.PytestUnhandledThreadExceptionWarning` exception if raised.
  * Extract the ``name`` of the thread object in the excepthook which should help with resurrection of the thread.


- `#13031 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13031>`_: An empty parameter set as in ``pytest.mark.parametrize([], ids=idfunc)`` will no longer trigger a call to ``idfunc`` with internal objects.


- `#13115 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13115>`_: Allows supplying ``ExceptionGroup[Exception]`` and ``BaseExceptionGroup[BaseException]`` to ``pytest.raises`` to keep full typing on :class:`ExceptionInfo <pytest.ExceptionInfo>`:

  .. code-block:: python

      with pytest.raises(ExceptionGroup[Exception]) as exc_info:
          some_function()

  Parametrizing with other exception types remains an error - we do not check the types of child exceptions and thus do not permit code that might look like we do.


- `#13122 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13122>`_: The ``--stepwise`` mode received a number of improvements:

  * It no longer forgets the last failed test in case pytest is executed later without the flag.

    This enables the following workflow:

    1. Execute pytest with ``--stepwise``, pytest then stops at the first failing test;
    2. Iteratively update the code and run the test in isolation, without the ``--stepwise`` flag (for example in an IDE), until it is fixed.
    3. Execute pytest with ``--stepwise`` again and pytest will continue from the previously failed test, and if it passes, continue on to the next tests.

    Previously, at step 3, pytest would start from the beginning, forgetting the previously failed test.

    This change however might cause issues if the ``--stepwise`` mode is used far apart in time, as the state might get stale, so the internal state will be reset automatically in case the test suite changes (for now only the number of tests are considered for this, we might change/improve this on the future).

  * New ``--stepwise-reset``/``--sw-reset`` flag, allowing the user to explicitly reset the stepwise state and restart the workflow from the beginning.


- `#13308 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13308>`_: Added official support for Python 3.14.


- `#13380 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13380>`_: Fix :class:`ExceptionGroup` traceback filtering to exclude pytest internals.


- `#13415 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13415>`_: The author metadata of the BibTex example is now correctly formatted with last names following first names.
  An example of BibLaTex has been added.
  BibTex and BibLaTex examples now clearly indicate that what is cited is software.

- `#13420 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13420>`_: Improved test collection performance by optimizing path resolution used in ``FSCollector``.


- `#13457 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13457>`_: The error message about duplicate parametrization no longer displays an internal stack trace.


- `#4112 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4112>`_: Using :ref:`pytest.mark.usefixtures <pytest.mark.usefixtures ref>` on :func:`pytest.param` now produces an error instead of silently doing nothing.


- `#5473 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5473>`_: Replace `:` with `;` in the assertion rewrite warning message so it can be filtered using standard Python warning filters before calling :func:`pytest.main`.


- `#6985 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6985>`_: Improved :func:`pytest.approx` to enhance the readability of value ranges and tolerances between 0.001 and 1000.
    * The `repr` method now provides clearer output for values within those ranges, making it easier to interpret the results.
    * Previously, the output for those ranges of values and tolerances was displayed in scientific notation (e.g., `42 ± 1.0e+00`). The updated method now presents the tolerance as a decimal for better readability (e.g., `42 ± 1`).

      Example:

      **Previous Output:**

      .. code-block:: console

          >>> pytest.approx(42, abs=1)
          42 ± 1.0e+00

      **Current Output:**

      .. code-block:: console

          >>> pytest.approx(42, abs=1)
          42 ± 1

- `#7683 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7683>`_: The formerly optional ``pygments`` dependency is now required, causing output always to be source-highlighted (unless disabled via the ``--code-highlight=no`` CLI option).



Bug fixes
---------

- `#10404 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10404>`_: Apply filterwarnings from config/cli as soon as possible, and revert them as late as possible
  so that warnings as errors are collected throughout the pytest run and before the
  unraisable and threadexcept hooks are removed.

  This allows very late warnings and unraisable/threadexcept exceptions to fail the test suite.

  This also changes the warning that the lsof plugin issues from PytestWarning to the new warning PytestFDWarning so it can be more easily filtered.


- `#11067 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11067>`_: The test report is now consistent regardless if the test xfailed via :ref:`pytest.mark.xfail <pytest.mark.xfail ref>` or :func:`pytest.fail`.

  Previously, *xfailed* tests via the marker would have the string ``"reason: "`` prefixed to the message, while those *xfailed* via the function did not. The prefix has been removed.


- `#12008 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12008>`_: In :pr:`11220`, an unintended change in reordering was introduced by changing the way indices were assigned to direct params. More specifically, before that change, the indices of direct params to metafunc's callspecs were assigned after all parametrizations took place. Now, that change is reverted.


- `#12863 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12863>`_: Fix applying markers, including :ref:`pytest.mark.parametrize <pytest.mark.parametrize ref>` when placed above `@staticmethod` or `@classmethod`.


- `#12929 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12929>`_: Handle StopIteration from test cases, setup and teardown correctly.


- `#12938 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12938>`_: Fixed ``--durations-min`` argument not respected if ``-vv`` is used.


- `#12946 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12946>`_: Fixed missing help for :mod:`pdb` commands wrapped by pytest -- by :user:`adamchainz`.


- `#12981 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12981>`_: Prevent exceptions in :func:`pytest.Config.add_cleanup` callbacks preventing further cleanups.


- `#13047 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13047>`_: Restore :func:`pytest.approx` handling of equality checks between `bool` and `numpy.bool_` types.

  Comparing `bool` and `numpy.bool_` using :func:`pytest.approx` accidentally changed in version `8.3.4` and `8.3.5` to no longer match:

  .. code-block:: pycon

      >>> import numpy as np
      >>> from pytest import approx
      >>> [np.True_, np.True_] == pytest.approx([True, True])
      False

  This has now been fixed:

  .. code-block:: pycon

      >>> [np.True_, np.True_] == pytest.approx([True, True])
      True


- `#13119 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13119>`_: Improved handling of invalid regex patterns for filter warnings by providing a clear error message.


- `#13175 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13175>`_: The diff is now also highlighted correctly when comparing two strings.


- `#13248 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13248>`_: Fixed an issue where passing a ``scope`` in :py:func:`Metafunc.parametrize <pytest.Metafunc.parametrize>` with ``indirect=True``
  could result in other fixtures being unable to depend on the parametrized fixture.


- `#13291 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13291>`_: Fixed ``repr`` of ``attrs`` objects in assertion failure messages when using ``attrs>=25.2``.


- `#13312 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13312>`_: Fixed a possible ``KeyError`` crash on PyPy during collection of tests involving higher-scoped parameters.


- `#13345 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13345>`_: Fix type hints for :attr:`pytest.TestReport.when` and :attr:`pytest.TestReport.location`.


- `#13377 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13377>`_: Fixed handling of test methods with positional-only parameter syntax.

  Now, methods are supported that formally define ``self`` as positional-only
  and/or fixture parameters as keyword-only, e.g.:

  .. code-block:: python

      class TestClass:

          def test_method(self, /, *, fixture): ...

  Before, this caused an internal error in pytest.


- `#13384 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13384>`_: Fixed an issue where pytest could report negative durations.


- `#13420 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13420>`_: Added ``lru_cache`` to ``nodes._check_initialpaths_for_relpath``.


- `#9037 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9037>`_: Honor :confval:`disable_test_id_escaping_and_forfeit_all_rights_to_community_support` when escaping ids in parametrized tests.



Improved documentation
----------------------

- `#12535 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12535>`_: `This
  example`<https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/simple.html#making-test-result-information-available-in-fixtures>
  showed ``print`` statements that do not exactly reflect what the
  different branches actually do.  The fix makes the example more precise.


- `#13218 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13218>`_: Pointed out in the :func:`pytest.approx` documentation that it considers booleans unequal to numeric zero or one.


- `#13221 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13221>`_: Improved grouping of CLI options in the ``--help`` output.


- `#6649 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6649>`_: Added :class:`~pytest.TerminalReporter` to the :ref:`api-reference` documentation page.


- `#8612 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8612>`_: Add a recipe for handling abstract test classes in the documentation.

  A new example has been added to the documentation to demonstrate how to use a mixin class to handle abstract
  test classes without manually setting the ``__test__`` attribute for subclasses.
  This ensures that subclasses of abstract test classes are automatically collected by pytest.



Packaging updates and notes for downstreams
-------------------------------------------

- `#13317 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13317>`_: Specified minimum allowed versions of ``colorama``, ``iniconfig``,
  and ``packaging``; and bumped the minimum allowed version
  of ``exceptiongroup`` for ``python_version<'3.11'`` from a release
  candidate to a full release.



Contributor-facing changes

- `#12888 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12888>`_: Fixed broken input when using Python 3.13+ and a ``libedit`` build of Python, such as on macOS or with uv-managed Python binaries from the ``python-build-standalone`` project. This could manifest e.g. by a broken prompt when using ``Pdb``, or seeing empty inputs with manual usage of ``input()`` and suspended capturing.


- `#13026 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13026>`_: Fixed :class:`AttributeError`  crash when using ``--import-mode=importlib`` when top-level directory same name as another module of the standard library.


- `#13053 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13053>`_: Fixed a regression in pytest 8.3.4 where, when using ``--import-mode=importlib``, a directory containing py file with the same name would cause an ``ImportError``

- `#12818 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12818>`_: Assertion rewriting now preserves the source ranges of the original instructions, making it play well with tools that deal with the ``AST``, like `executing <https://github.com/alexmojaki/executing>`__.


- `#12849 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12849>`_: ANSI escape codes for colored output now handled correctly in :func:`pytest.fail` with `pytrace=False`.

pytest 8.3.1 (2024-07-20)
=========================

The 8.3.0 release failed to include the change notes and docs for the release. This patch release remedies this. There are no other changes.


pytest 8.3.0 (2024-07-20)
=========================

New features
------------

- `#12231 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12231>`_: Added `--xfail-tb` flag, which turns on traceback output for XFAIL results.

  * If the `--xfail-tb` flag is not given, tracebacks for XFAIL results are NOT shown.
  * The style of traceback for XFAIL is set with `--tb`, and can be `auto|long|short|line|native|no`.
  * Note: Even if you have `--xfail-tb` set, you won't see them if `--tb=no`.

  Some history:

  With pytest 8.0, `-rx` or `-ra` would not only turn on summary reports for xfail, but also report the tracebacks for xfail results. This caused issues with some projects that utilize xfail, but don't want to see all of the xfail tracebacks.

  This change detaches xfail tracebacks from `-rx`, and now we turn on xfail tracebacks with `--xfail-tb`. With this, the default `-rx`/ `-ra` behavior is identical to pre-8.0 with respect to xfail tracebacks. While this is a behavior change, it brings default behavior back to pre-8.0.0 behavior, which ultimately was considered the better course of action.

- `#12281 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12281>`_: Added support for keyword matching in marker expressions.

  Now tests can be selected by marker keyword arguments.
  Supported values are :class:`int`, (unescaped) :class:`str`, :class:`bool` & :data:`None`.

  See :ref:`marker examples <marker_keyword_expression_example>` for more information.

  -- by :user:`lovetheguitar`


- `#12567 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12567>`_: Added ``--no-fold-skipped`` command line option.

  If this option is set, then skipped tests in short summary are no longer grouped
  by reason but all tests are printed individually with their nodeid in the same
  way as other statuses.

Improvements in existing functionality
--------------------------------------

- `#12469 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12469>`_: The console output now uses the "third-party plugins" terminology,
  replacing the previously established but confusing and outdated
  reference to :std:doc:`setuptools <setuptools:index>`
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.


- `#12544 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12544>`_, `#12545 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12545>`_: Python virtual environment detection was improved by
  checking for a :file:`pyvenv.cfg` file, ensuring reliable detection on
  various platforms -- by :user:`zachsnickers`.


- `#2871 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2871>`_: Do not truncate arguments to functions in output when running with `-vvv`.


- `#389 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/389>`_: The readability of assertion introspection of bound methods has been enhanced
  -- by :user:`farbodahm`, :user:`webknjaz`, :user:`obestwalter`, :user:`flub`
  and :user:`glyphack`.

  Earlier, it was like:

  .. code-block:: console

      =================================== FAILURES ===================================
      _____________________________________ test _____________________________________

          def test():
      >       assert Help().fun() == 2
      E       assert 1 == 2
      E        +  where 1 = <bound method Help.fun of <example.Help instance at 0x256a830>>()
      E        +    where <bound method Help.fun of <example.Help instance at 0x256a830>> = <example.Help instance at 0x256a830>.fun
      E        +      where <example.Help instance at 0x256a830> = Help()

      example.py:7: AssertionError
      =========================== 1 failed in 0.03 seconds ===========================


  And now it's like:

  .. code-block:: console

      =================================== FAILURES ===================================
      _____________________________________ test _____________________________________

          def test():
      >       assert Help().fun() == 2
      E       assert 1 == 2
      E        +  where 1 = fun()
      E        +    where fun = <test_local.Help object at 0x1074be230>.fun
      E        +      where <test_local.Help object at 0x1074be230> = Help()

      test_local.py:13: AssertionError
      =========================== 1 failed in 0.03 seconds ===========================


- `#7662 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7662>`_: Added timezone information to the testsuite timestamp in the JUnit XML report.



Bug fixes
---------

- `#11706 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11706>`_: Fixed reporting of teardown errors in higher-scoped fixtures when using `--maxfail` or `--stepwise`.

  Originally added in pytest 8.0.0, but reverted in 8.0.2 due to a regression in pytest-xdist.
  This regression was fixed in pytest-xdist 3.6.1.


- `#11797 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11797>`_: :func:`pytest.approx` now correctly handles :class:`Sequence <collections.abc.Sequence>`-like objects.


- `#12204 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12204>`_, `#12264 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12264>`_: Fixed a regression in pytest 8.0 where tracebacks get longer and longer when multiple
  tests fail due to a shared higher-scope fixture which raised -- by :user:`bluetech`.

  Also fixed a similar regression in pytest 5.4 for collectors which raise during setup.

  The fix necessitated internal changes which may affect some plugins:

  * ``FixtureDef.cached_result[2]`` is now a tuple ``(exc, tb)``
    instead of ``exc``.
  * ``SetupState.stack`` failures are now a tuple ``(exc, tb)``
    instead of ``exc``.


- `#12275 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12275>`_: Fixed collection error upon encountering an :mod:`abstract <abc>` class, including abstract `unittest.TestCase` subclasses.


- `#12328 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12328>`_: Fixed a regression in pytest 8.0.0 where package-scoped parameterized items were not correctly reordered to minimize setups/teardowns in some cases.


- `#12424 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12424>`_: Fixed crash with `assert testcase is not None` assertion failure when re-running unittest tests using plugins like pytest-rerunfailures. Regressed in 8.2.2.


- `#12472 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12472>`_: Fixed a crash when returning category ``"error"`` or ``"failed"`` with a custom test status from :hook:`pytest_report_teststatus` hook -- :user:`pbrezina`.


- `#12505 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12505>`_: Improved handling of invalid regex patterns in :func:`pytest.raises(match=r'...') <pytest.raises>` by providing a clear error message.


- `#12580 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12580>`_: Fixed a crash when using the cache class on Windows and the cache directory was created concurrently.


- `#6962 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6962>`_: Parametrization parameters are now compared using `==` instead of `is` (`is` is still used as a fallback if the parameter does not support `==`).
  This fixes use of parameters such as lists, which have a different `id` but compare equal, causing fixtures to be re-computed instead of being cached.


- `#7166 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7166>`_: Fixed progress percentages (the ``[ 87%]`` at the edge of the screen) sometimes not aligning correctly when running with pytest-xdist ``-n``.



Improved documentation
----------------------

- `#12153 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12153>`_: Documented using :envvar:`PYTEST_VERSION` to detect if code is running from within a pytest run.


- `#12469 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12469>`_: The external plugin mentions in the documentation now avoid mentioning
  :std:doc:`setuptools entry-points <setuptools:index>` as the concept is
  much more generic nowadays. Instead, the terminology of "external",
  "installed", or "third-party" plugins (or packages) replaces that.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`


- `#12577 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12577>`_: `CI` and `BUILD_NUMBER` environment variables role is described in
  the reference doc. They now also appear when doing `pytest -h`
  -- by :user:`MarcBresson`.

- `#12467 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12467>`_: Migrated all internal type-annotations to the python3.10+ style by using the `annotations` future import.

  -- by :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt`


- `#11771 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11771>`_, `#12557 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12557>`_: The PyPy runtime version has been updated to 3.9 from 3.8 that introduced
  a flaky bug at the garbage collector which was not expected to fix there
  as the 3.8 is EoL.

  -- by :user:`x612skm`


- `#12493 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12493>`_: The change log draft preview integration has been refactored to use a
  third party extension ``sphinxcontib-towncrier``. The previous in-repo
  script was putting the change log preview file at
  :file:`doc/en/_changelog_towncrier_draft.rst`. Said file is no longer
  ignored in Git and might show up among untracked files in the
  development environments of the contributors. To address that, the
  contributors can run the following command that will clean it up:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ git clean -x -i -- doc/en/_changelog_towncrier_draft.rst

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`


- `#12498 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12498>`_: All the undocumented ``tox`` environments now have descriptions.
  They can be listed in one's development environment by invoking
  ``tox -av`` in a terminal.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`


- `#12501 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12501>`_: The changelog configuration has been updated to introduce more accurate
  audience-tailored categories. Previously, there was a ``trivial``
  change log fragment type with an unclear and broad meaning. It was
  removed and we now have ``contrib``, ``misc`` and ``packaging`` in
  place of it.

  The new change note types target the readers who are downstream
  packagers and project contributors. Additionally, the miscellaneous
  section is kept for unspecified updates that do not fit anywhere else.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`


- `#12502 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12502>`_: The UX of the GitHub automation making pull requests to update the
  plugin list has been updated. Previously, the maintainers had to close
  the automatically created pull requests and re-open them to trigger the
  CI runs. From now on, they only need to click the `Ready for review`
  button instead.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`


- `#12522 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12522>`_: The ``:pull:`` RST role has been replaced with a shorter
  ``:pr:`` due to starting to use the implementation from
  the third-party :pypi:`sphinx-issues` Sphinx extension
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.


- `#12531 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12531>`_: The coverage reporting configuration has been updated to exclude
  pytest's own tests marked as expected to fail from the coverage
  report. This has an effect of reducing the influence of flaky
  tests on the resulting number.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`


- `#12533 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12533>`_: The ``extlinks`` Sphinx extension is no longer enabled. The ``:bpo:``
  role it used to declare has been removed with that. BPO itself has
  migrated to GitHub some years ago and it is possible to link the
  respective issues by using their GitHub issue numbers and the
  ``:issue:`` role that the ``sphinx-issues`` extension implements.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`


- `#12562 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12562>`_: Possible typos in using the ``:user:`` RST role is now being linted
  through the pre-commit tool integration -- by :user:`webknjaz`.


pytest 8.2.2 (2024-06-04)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#12355 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12355>`_: Fix possible catastrophic performance slowdown on a certain parametrization pattern involving many higher-scoped parameters.


- `#12367 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12367>`_: Fix a regression in pytest 8.2.0 where unittest class instances (a fresh one is created for each test) were not released promptly on test teardown but only on session teardown.


- `#12381 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12381>`_: Fix possible "Directory not empty" crashes arising from concurrent cache dir (``.pytest_cache``) creation. Regressed in pytest 8.2.0.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `#12290 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12290>`_: Updated Sphinx theme to use Furo instead of Flask, enabling Dark mode theme.


- `#12356 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12356>`_: Added a subsection to the documentation for debugging flaky tests to mention
  lack of thread safety in pytest as a possible source of flakiness.


- `#12363 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12363>`_: The documentation webpages now links to a canonical version to reduce outdated documentation in search engine results.


pytest 8.2.1 (2024-05-19)
=========================

Improvements
------------

- `#12334 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12334>`_: Support for Python 3.13 (beta1 at the time of writing).



Bug Fixes
---------

- `#12120 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12120>`_: Fix `PermissionError` crashes arising from directories which are not selected on the command-line.


- `#12191 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12191>`_: Keyboard interrupts and system exits are now properly handled during the test collection.


- `#12300 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12300>`_: Fixed handling of 'Function not implemented' error under squashfuse_ll, which is a different way to say that the mountpoint is read-only.


- `#12308 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12308>`_: Fix a regression in pytest 8.2.0 where the permissions of automatically-created ``.pytest_cache`` directories became ``rwx------`` instead of the expected ``rwxr-xr-x``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `#12333 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12333>`_: pytest releases are now attested using the recent `Artifact Attestation <https://github.blog/2024-05-02-introducing-artifact-attestations-now-in-public-beta/>`_ support from GitHub, allowing users to verify the provenance of pytest's sdist and wheel artifacts.


pytest 8.2.0 (2024-04-27)
=========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

- `#12089 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/12089>`_: pytest now requires that :class:`unittest.TestCase` subclasses can be instantiated freely using ``MyTestCase('runTest')``.

  If the class doesn't allow this, you may see an error during collection such as ``AttributeError: 'MyTestCase' object has no attribute 'runTest'``.

  Classes which do not override ``__init__``, or do not access the test method in ``__init__`` using ``getattr`` or similar, are unaffected.

  Classes which do should take care to not crash when ``"runTest"`` is given, as is shown in `unittest.TestCases's implementation <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/51aefc5bf907ddffaaf083ded0de773adcdf08c8/Lib/unittest/case.py#L419-L426>`_.
  Alternatively, consider using :meth:`setUp <unittest.TestCase.setUp>` instead of ``__init__``.

  If you run into this issue using ``tornado.AsyncTestCase``, please see `issue 12263 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12263>`_.

  If you run into this issue using an abstract ``TestCase`` subclass, please see `issue 12275 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12275>`_.

  Historical note: the effect of this change on custom TestCase implementations was not properly considered initially, this is why it was done in a minor release. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Deprecations
------------

- `#12069 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069>`_: A deprecation warning is now raised when implementations of one of the following hooks request a deprecated ``py.path.local`` parameter instead of the ``pathlib.Path`` parameter which replaced it:

  - :hook:`pytest_ignore_collect` - the ``path`` parameter - use ``collection_path`` instead.
  - :hook:`pytest_collect_file` - the ``path`` parameter - use ``file_path`` instead.
  - :hook:`pytest_pycollect_makemodule` - the ``path`` parameter - use ``module_path`` instead.
  - :hook:`pytest_report_header` - the ``startdir`` parameter - use ``start_path`` instead.
  - :hook:`pytest_report_collectionfinish` - the ``startdir`` parameter - use ``start_path`` instead.

  The replacement parameters are available since pytest 7.0.0.
  The old parameters will be removed in pytest 9.0.0.

  See :ref:`legacy-path-hooks-deprecated` for more details.



Features
--------

- `#11871 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11871>`_: Added support for reading command line arguments from a file using the prefix character ``@``, like e.g.: ``pytest @tests.txt``. The file must have one argument per line.

  See :ref:`Read arguments from file <args-from-file>` for details.



Improvements
------------

- `#11523 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11523>`_: :func:`pytest.importorskip` will now issue a warning if the module could be found, but raised :class:`ImportError` instead of :class:`ModuleNotFoundError`.

  The warning can be suppressed by passing ``exc_type=ImportError`` to :func:`pytest.importorskip`.

  See :ref:`import-or-skip-import-error` for details.


- `#11728 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11728>`_: For ``unittest``-based tests, exceptions during class cleanup (as raised by functions registered with :meth:`TestCase.addClassCleanup <unittest.TestCase.addClassCleanup>`) are now reported instead of silently failing.


- `#11777 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11777>`_: Text is no longer truncated in the ``short test summary info`` section when ``-vv`` is given.


- `#12112 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12112>`_: Improved namespace packages detection when :confval:`consider_namespace_packages` is enabled, covering more situations (like editable installs).


- `#9502 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9502>`_: Added :envvar:`PYTEST_VERSION` environment variable which is defined at the start of the pytest session and undefined afterwards. It contains the value of ``pytest.__version__``, and among other things can be used to easily check if code is running from within a pytest run.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `#12065 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12065>`_: Fixed a regression in pytest 8.0.0 where test classes containing ``setup_method`` and tests using ``@staticmethod`` or ``@classmethod`` would crash with ``AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'setup_method'``.

  Now the :attr:`request.instance <pytest.FixtureRequest.instance>` attribute of tests using ``@staticmethod`` and ``@classmethod`` is no longer ``None``, but a fresh instance of the class, like in non-static methods.
  Previously it was ``None``, and all fixtures of such tests would share a single ``self``.


- `#12135 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12135>`_: Fixed issue where fixtures adding their finalizer multiple times to fixtures they request would cause unreliable and non-intuitive teardown ordering in some instances.


- `#12194 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12194>`_: Fixed a bug with ``--importmode=importlib`` and ``--doctest-modules`` where child modules did not appear as attributes in parent modules.


- `#1489 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1489>`_: Fixed some instances where teardown of higher-scoped fixtures was not happening in the reverse order they were initialized in.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `#12069 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069>`_: ``pluggy>=1.5.0`` is now required.


- `#12167 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12167>`_: :ref:`cache <cache>`: create supporting files (``CACHEDIR.TAG``, ``.gitignore``, etc.) in a temporary directory to provide atomic semantics.


pytest 8.1.2 (2024-04-26)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#12114 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12114>`_: Fixed error in :func:`pytest.approx` when used with `numpy` arrays and comparing with other types.


pytest 8.1.1 (2024-03-08)
=========================

.. note::

       This release is not a usual bug fix release -- it contains features and improvements, being a follow up
       to ``8.1.0``, which has been yanked from PyPI.

Features
--------

- `#11475 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11475>`_: Added the new :confval:`consider_namespace_packages` configuration option, defaulting to ``False``.

  If set to ``True``, pytest will attempt to identify modules that are part of `namespace packages <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages>`__ when importing modules.


- `#11653 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11653>`_: Added the new :confval:`verbosity_test_cases` configuration option for fine-grained control of test execution verbosity.
  See :ref:`Fine-grained verbosity <pytest.fine_grained_verbosity>` for more details.



Improvements
------------

- `#10865 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10865>`_: :func:`pytest.warns` now validates that :func:`warnings.warn` was called with a `str` or a `Warning`.
  Currently in Python it is possible to use other types, however this causes an exception when :func:`warnings.filterwarnings` is used to filter those warnings (see `CPython #103577 <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103577>`__ for a discussion).
  While this can be considered a bug in CPython, we decided to put guards in pytest as the error message produced without this check in place is confusing.


- `#11311 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11311>`_: When using ``--override-ini`` for paths in invocations without a configuration file defined, the current working directory is used
  as the relative directory.

  Previously this would raise an :class:`AssertionError`.


- `#11475 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11475>`_: :ref:`--import-mode=importlib <import-mode-importlib>` now tries to import modules using the standard import mechanism (but still without changing :py:data:`sys.path`), falling back to importing modules directly only if that fails.

  This means that installed packages will be imported under their canonical name if possible first, for example ``app.core.models``, instead of having the module name always be derived from their path (for example ``.env310.lib.site_packages.app.core.models``).


- `#11801 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11801>`_: Added the :func:`iter_parents() <_pytest.nodes.Node.iter_parents>` helper method on nodes.
  It is similar to :func:`listchain <_pytest.nodes.Node.listchain>`, but goes from bottom to top, and returns an iterator, not a list.


- `#11850 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11850>`_: Added support for :data:`sys.last_exc` for post-mortem debugging on Python>=3.12.


- `#11962 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11962>`_: In case no other suitable candidates for configuration file are found, a ``pyproject.toml`` (even without a ``[tool.pytest.ini_options]`` table) will be considered as the configuration file and define the ``rootdir``.


- `#11978 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11978>`_: Add ``--log-file-mode`` option to the logging plugin, enabling appending to log-files. This option accepts either ``"w"`` or ``"a"`` and defaults to ``"w"``.

  Previously, the mode was hard-coded to be ``"w"`` which truncates the file before logging.


- `#12047 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12047>`_: When multiple finalizers of a fixture raise an exception, now all exceptions are reported as an exception group.
  Previously, only the first exception was reported.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `#11475 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11475>`_: Fixed regression where ``--importmode=importlib`` would import non-test modules more than once.


- `#11904 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11904>`_: Fixed a regression in pytest 8.0.0 that would cause test collection to fail due to permission errors when using ``--pyargs``.

  This change improves the collection tree for tests specified using ``--pyargs``, see :pr:`12043` for a comparison with pytest 8.0 and <8.


- `#12011 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12011>`_: Fixed a regression in 8.0.1 whereby ``setup_module`` xunit-style fixtures are not executed when ``--doctest-modules`` is passed.


- `#12014 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12014>`_: Fix the ``stacklevel`` used when warning about marks used on fixtures.


- `#12039 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12039>`_: Fixed a regression in ``8.0.2`` where tests created using :fixture:`tmp_path` have been collected multiple times in CI under Windows.


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `#11790 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11790>`_: Documented the retention of temporary directories created using the ``tmp_path`` fixture in more detail.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `#11785 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11785>`_: Some changes were made to private functions which may affect plugins which access them:

  - ``FixtureManager._getautousenames()`` now takes a ``Node`` itself instead of the nodeid.
  - ``FixtureManager.getfixturedefs()`` now takes the ``Node`` itself instead of the nodeid.
  - The ``_pytest.nodes.iterparentnodeids()`` function is removed without replacement.
    Prefer to traverse the node hierarchy itself instead.
    If you really need to, copy the function from the previous pytest release.


- `#12069 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069>`_: Delayed the deprecation of the following features to ``9.0.0``:

  * :ref:`node-ctor-fspath-deprecation`.
  * :ref:`legacy-path-hooks-deprecated`.

  It was discovered after ``8.1.0`` was released that the warnings about the impeding removal were not being displayed, so the team decided to revert the removal.

  This is the reason for ``8.1.0`` being yanked.


pytest 8.1.0 (YANKED)
=====================


.. note::

       This release has been **yanked**: it broke some plugins without the proper warning period, due to
       some warnings not showing up as expected.

       See `#12069 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069>`__.


pytest 8.0.2 (2024-02-24)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#11895 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11895>`_: Fix collection on Windows where initial paths contain the short version of a path (for example ``c:\PROGRA~1\tests``).


- `#11953 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11953>`_: Fix an ``IndexError`` crash raising from ``getstatementrange_ast``.


- `#12021 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12021>`_: Reverted a fix to `--maxfail` handling in pytest 8.0.0 because it caused a regression in pytest-xdist whereby session fixture teardowns may get executed multiple times when the max-fails is reached.


pytest 8.0.1 (2024-02-16)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#11875 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11875>`_: Correctly handle errors from :func:`getpass.getuser` in Python 3.13.


- `#11879 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11879>`_: Fix an edge case where ``ExceptionInfo._stringify_exception`` could crash :func:`pytest.raises`.


- `#11906 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11906>`_: Fix regression with :func:`pytest.warns` using custom warning subclasses which have more than one parameter in their `__init__`.


- `#11907 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11907>`_: Fix a regression in pytest 8.0.0 whereby calling :func:`pytest.skip` and similar control-flow exceptions within a :func:`pytest.warns()` block would get suppressed instead of propagating.


- `#11929 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11929>`_: Fix a regression in pytest 8.0.0 whereby autouse fixtures defined in a module get ignored by the doctests in the module.


- `#11937 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11937>`_: Fix a regression in pytest 8.0.0 whereby items would be collected in reverse order in some circumstances.


pytest 8.0.0 (2024-01-27)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#11842 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11842>`_: Properly escape the ``reason`` of a :ref:`skip <pytest.mark.skip ref>` mark when writing JUnit XML files.


- `#11861 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11861>`_: Avoid microsecond exceeds ``1_000_000`` when using ``log-date-format`` with ``%f`` specifier, which might cause the test suite to crash.


pytest 8.0.0rc2 (2024-01-17)
============================


Improvements
------------

- `#11233 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11233>`_: Improvements to ``-r`` for xfailures and xpasses:

  * Report tracebacks for xfailures when ``-rx`` is set.
  * Report captured output for xpasses when ``-rX`` is set.
  * For xpasses, add ``-`` in summary between test name and reason, to match how xfail is displayed.

- `#11825 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11825>`_: The :hook:`pytest_plugin_registered` hook has a new ``plugin_name`` parameter containing the name by which ``plugin`` is registered.


Bug Fixes
---------

- `#11706 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11706>`_: Fix reporting of teardown errors in higher-scoped fixtures when using `--maxfail` or `--stepwise`.

  NOTE: This change was reverted in pytest 8.0.2 to fix a `regression <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/1024>`_ it caused in pytest-xdist.


- `#11758 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11758>`_: Fixed ``IndexError: string index out of range`` crash in ``if highlighted[-1] == "\n" and source[-1] != "\n"``.
  This bug was introduced in pytest 8.0.0rc1.


- `#9765 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9765>`_, `#11816 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11816>`_: Fixed a frustrating bug that afflicted some users with the only error being ``assert mod not in mods``. The issue was caused by the fact that ``str(Path(mod))`` and ``mod.__file__`` don't necessarily produce the same string, and was being erroneously used interchangeably in some places in the code.

  This fix also broke the internal API of ``PytestPluginManager.consider_conftest`` by introducing a new parameter -- we mention this in case it is being used by external code, even if marked as *private*.


pytest 8.0.0rc1 (2023-12-30)
============================

Breaking Changes
----------------

Old Deprecations Are Now Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- `#7363 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7363>`_: **PytestRemovedIn8Warning deprecation warnings are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestRemovedIn8Warning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages by default.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 8.1**, so please consult the
  :ref:`deprecations` section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``8.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a
  stopgap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestRemovedIn8Warning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``8.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to :issue:`7363`.


Version Compatibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- `#11151 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11151>`_: Dropped support for Python 3.7, which `reached end-of-life on 2023-06-27 <https://devguide.python.org/versions/>`__.


- ``pluggy>=1.3.0`` is now required.


Collection Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this version we've made several breaking changes to pytest's collection phase,
particularly around how filesystem directories and Python packages are collected,
fixing deficiencies and allowing for cleanups and improvements to pytest's internals.
A deprecation period for these changes was not possible.


- `#7777 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7777>`_: Files and directories are now collected in alphabetical order jointly, unless changed by a plugin.
  Previously, files were collected before directories.
  See below for an example.


- `#8976 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8976>`_: Running `pytest pkg/__init__.py` now collects the `pkg/__init__.py` file (module) only.
  Previously, it collected the entire `pkg` package, including other test files in the directory, but excluding tests in the `__init__.py` file itself
  (unless :confval:`python_files` was changed to allow `__init__.py` file).

  To collect the entire package, specify just the directory: `pytest pkg`.


- `#11137 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11137>`_: :class:`pytest.Package` is no longer a :class:`pytest.Module` or :class:`pytest.File`.

  The ``Package`` collector node designates a Python package, that is, a directory with an `__init__.py` file.
  Previously ``Package`` was a subtype of ``pytest.Module`` (which represents a single Python module),
  the module being the `__init__.py` file.
  This has been deemed a design mistake (see :issue:`11137` and :issue:`7777` for details).

  The ``path`` property of ``Package`` nodes now points to the package directory instead of the ``__init__.py`` file.

  Note that a ``Module`` node for ``__init__.py`` (which is not a ``Package``) may still exist,
  if it is picked up during collection (e.g. if you configured :confval:`python_files` to include ``__init__.py`` files).


- `#7777 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7777>`_: Added a new :class:`pytest.Directory` base collection node, which all collector nodes for filesystem directories are expected to subclass.
  This is analogous to the existing :class:`pytest.File` for file nodes.

  Changed :class:`pytest.Package` to be a subclass of :class:`pytest.Directory`.
  A ``Package`` represents a filesystem directory which is a Python package,
  i.e. contains an ``__init__.py`` file.

  :class:`pytest.Package` now only collects files in its own directory; previously it collected recursively.
  Sub-directories are collected as their own collector nodes, which then collect themselves, thus creating a collection tree which mirrors the filesystem hierarchy.

  Added a new :class:`pytest.Dir` concrete collection node, a subclass of :class:`pytest.Directory`.
  This node represents a filesystem directory, which is not a :class:`pytest.Package`,
  that is, does not contain an ``__init__.py`` file.
  Similarly to ``Package``, it only collects the files in its own directory.

  :class:`pytest.Session` now only collects the initial arguments, without recursing into directories.
  This work is now done by the :func:`recursive expansion process <pytest.Collector.collect>` of directory collector nodes.

  :attr:`session.name <pytest.Session.name>` is now ``""``; previously it was the rootdir directory name.
  This matches :attr:`session.nodeid <_pytest.nodes.Node.nodeid>` which has always been `""`.

  The collection tree now contains directories/packages up to the :ref:`rootdir <rootdir>`,
  for initial arguments that are found within the rootdir.
  For files outside the rootdir, only the immediate directory/package is collected --
  note however that collecting from outside the rootdir is discouraged.

  As an example, given the following filesystem tree::

      myroot/
          pytest.ini
          top/
          ├── aaa
          │   └── test_aaa.py
          ├── test_a.py
          ├── test_b
          │   ├── __init__.py
          │   └── test_b.py
          ├── test_c.py
          └── zzz
              ├── __init__.py
              └── test_zzz.py

  the collection tree, as shown by `pytest --collect-only top/` but with the otherwise-hidden :class:`~pytest.Session` node added for clarity,
  is now the following::

      <Session>
        <Dir myroot>
          <Dir top>
            <Dir aaa>
              <Module test_aaa.py>
                <Function test_it>
            <Module test_a.py>
              <Function test_it>
            <Package test_b>
              <Module test_b.py>
                <Function test_it>
            <Module test_c.py>
              <Function test_it>
            <Package zzz>
              <Module test_zzz.py>
                <Function test_it>

  Previously, it was::

      <Session>
        <Module top/test_a.py>
          <Function test_it>
        <Module top/test_c.py>
          <Function test_it>
        <Module top/aaa/test_aaa.py>
          <Function test_it>
        <Package test_b>
          <Module test_b.py>
            <Function test_it>
        <Package zzz>
          <Module test_zzz.py>
            <Function test_it>

  Code/plugins which rely on a specific shape of the collection tree might need to update.


- `#11676 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11676>`_: The classes :class:`~_pytest.nodes.Node`, :class:`~pytest.Collector`, :class:`~pytest.Item`, :class:`~pytest.File`, :class:`~_pytest.nodes.FSCollector` are now marked abstract (see :mod:`abc`).

  We do not expect this change to affect users and plugin authors, it will only cause errors when the code is already wrong or problematic.


Other breaking changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These are breaking changes where deprecation was not possible.


- `#11282 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11282>`_: Sanitized the handling of the ``default`` parameter when defining configuration options.

  Previously if ``default`` was not supplied for :meth:`parser.addini <pytest.Parser.addini>` and the configuration option value was not defined in a test session, then calls to :func:`config.getini <pytest.Config.getini>` returned an *empty list* or an *empty string* depending on whether ``type`` was supplied or not respectively, which is clearly incorrect. Also, ``None`` was not honored even if ``default=None`` was used explicitly while defining the option.

  Now the behavior of :meth:`parser.addini <pytest.Parser.addini>` is as follows:

  * If ``default`` is NOT passed but ``type`` is provided, then a type-specific default will be returned. For example ``type=bool`` will return ``False``, ``type=str`` will return ``""``, etc.
  * If ``default=None`` is passed and the option is not defined in a test session, then ``None`` will be returned, regardless of the ``type``.
  * If neither ``default`` nor ``type`` are provided, assume ``type=str`` and return ``""`` as default (this is as per previous behavior).

  The team decided to not introduce a deprecation period for this change, as doing so would be complicated both in terms of communicating this to the community as well as implementing it, and also because the team believes this change should not break existing plugins except in rare cases.


- `#11667 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11667>`_: pytest's ``setup.py`` file is removed.
  If you relied on this file, e.g. to install pytest using ``setup.py install``,
  please see `Why you shouldn't invoke setup.py directly <https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2021/10/setup-py-deprecated.html#summary>`_ for alternatives.


- `#9288 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9288>`_: :func:`~pytest.warns` now re-emits unmatched warnings when the context
  closes -- previously it would consume all warnings, hiding those that were not
  matched by the function.

  While this is a new feature, we announce it as a breaking change
  because many test suites are configured to error-out on warnings, and will
  therefore fail on the newly-re-emitted warnings.


- The internal ``FixtureManager.getfixtureclosure`` method has changed. Plugins which use this method or
  which subclass ``FixtureManager`` and overwrite that method will need to adapt to the change.



Deprecations
------------

- `#10465 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10465>`_: Test functions returning a value other than ``None`` will now issue a :class:`pytest.PytestWarning` instead of ``pytest.PytestRemovedIn8Warning``, meaning this will stay a warning instead of becoming an error in the future.


- `#3664 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3664>`_: Applying a mark to a fixture function now issues a warning: marks in fixtures never had any effect, but it is a common user error to apply a mark to a fixture (for example ``usefixtures``) and expect it to work.

  This will become an error in pytest 9.0.



Features and Improvements
-------------------------

Improved Diffs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These changes improve the diffs that pytest prints when an assertion fails.
Note that syntax highlighting requires the ``pygments`` package.


- `#11520 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11520>`_: The very verbose (``-vv``) diff output is now colored as a diff instead of a big chunk of red.

  Python code in error reports is now syntax-highlighted as Python.

  The sections in the error reports are now better separated.


- `#1531 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1531>`_: The very verbose diff (``-vv``) for every standard library container type is improved. The indentation is now consistent and the markers are on their own separate lines, which should reduce the diffs shown to users.

  Previously, the standard Python pretty printer was used to generate the output, which puts opening and closing
  markers on the same line as the first/last entry, in addition to not having consistent indentation.


- `#10617 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10617>`_: Added more comprehensive set assertion rewrites for comparisons other than equality ``==``, with
  the following operations now providing better failure messages: ``!=``, ``<=``, ``>=``, ``<``, and ``>``.


Separate Control For Assertion Verbosity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- `#11387 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11387>`_: Added the new :confval:`verbosity_assertions` configuration option for fine-grained control of failed assertions verbosity.

  If you've ever wished that pytest always show you full diffs, but without making everything else verbose, this is for you.

  See :ref:`Fine-grained verbosity <pytest.fine_grained_verbosity>` for more details.

  For plugin authors, :attr:`config.get_verbosity <pytest.Config.get_verbosity>` can be used to retrieve the verbosity level for a specific verbosity type.


Additional Support For Exception Groups and ``__notes__``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These changes improve pytest's support for exception groups.


- `#10441 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10441>`_: Added :func:`ExceptionInfo.group_contains() <pytest.ExceptionInfo.group_contains>`, an assertion helper that tests if an :class:`ExceptionGroup` contains a matching exception.

  See :ref:`assert-matching-exception-groups` for an example.


- `#11227 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11227>`_: Allow :func:`pytest.raises` ``match`` argument to match against `PEP-678 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0678/>` ``__notes__``.


Custom Directory collectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- `#7777 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7777>`_: Added a new hook :hook:`pytest_collect_directory`,
  which is called by filesystem-traversing collector nodes,
  such as :class:`pytest.Session`, :class:`pytest.Dir` and :class:`pytest.Package`,
  to create a collector node for a sub-directory.
  It is expected to return a subclass of :class:`pytest.Directory`.
  This hook allows plugins to :ref:`customize the collection of directories <custom directory collectors>`.


"New-style" Hook Wrappers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- `#11122 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11122>`_: pytest now uses "new-style" hook wrappers internally, available since pluggy 1.2.0.
  See `pluggy's 1.2.0 changelog <https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#pluggy-1-2-0-2023-06-21>`_ and the :ref:`updated docs <hookwrapper>` for details.

  Plugins which want to use new-style wrappers can do so if they require ``pytest>=8``.


Other Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- `#11216 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11216>`_: If a test is skipped from inside an :ref:`xunit setup fixture <classic xunit>`, the test summary now shows the test location instead of the fixture location.


- `#11314 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11314>`_: Logging to a file using the ``--log-file`` option will use ``--log-level``, ``--log-format`` and ``--log-date-format`` as fallback
  if ``--log-file-level``, ``--log-file-format`` and ``--log-file-date-format`` are not provided respectively.


- `#11610 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11610>`_: Added the :func:`LogCaptureFixture.filtering() <pytest.LogCaptureFixture.filtering>` context manager which
  adds a given :class:`logging.Filter` object to the :fixture:`caplog` fixture.


- `#11447 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11447>`_: :func:`pytest.deprecated_call` now also considers warnings of type :class:`FutureWarning`.


- `#11600 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11600>`_: Improved the documentation and type signature for :func:`pytest.mark.xfail <pytest.mark.xfail>`'s ``condition`` param to use ``False`` as the default value.


- `#7469 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7469>`_: :class:`~pytest.FixtureDef` is now exported as ``pytest.FixtureDef`` for typing purposes.


- `#11353 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11353>`_: Added typing to :class:`~pytest.PytestPluginManager`.


Bug Fixes
---------

- `#10701 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10701>`_: :meth:`pytest.WarningsRecorder.pop` will return the most-closely-matched warning in the list,
  rather than the first warning which is an instance of the requested type.


- `#11255 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11255>`_: Fixed crash on `parametrize(..., scope="package")` without a package present.


- `#11277 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11277>`_: Fixed a bug that when there are multiple fixtures for an indirect parameter,
  the scope of the highest-scope fixture is picked for the parameter set, instead of that of the one with the narrowest scope.


- `#11456 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11456>`_: Parametrized tests now *really do* ensure that the ids given to each input are unique - for
  example, ``a, a, a0`` now results in ``a1, a2, a0`` instead of the previous (buggy) ``a0, a1, a0``.
  This necessarily means changing nodeids where these were previously colliding, and for
  readability adds an underscore when non-unique ids end in a number.


- `#11563 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11563>`_: Fixed a crash when using an empty string for the same parametrized value more than once.


- `#11712 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11712>`_: Fixed handling ``NO_COLOR`` and ``FORCE_COLOR`` to ignore an empty value.


- `#9036 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9036>`_: ``pytest.warns`` and similar functions now capture warnings when an exception is raised inside a ``with`` block.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `#11011 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11011>`_: Added a warning about modifying the root logger during tests when using ``caplog``.


- `#11065 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11065>`_: Use ``pytestconfig`` instead of ``request.config`` in cache example to be consistent with the API documentation.


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `#11208 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11208>`_: The (internal) ``FixtureDef.cached_result`` type has changed.
  Now the third item ``cached_result[2]``, when set, is an exception instance instead of an exception triplet.


- `#11218 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11218>`_: (This entry is meant to assist plugins which access private pytest internals to instantiate ``FixtureRequest`` objects.)

  :class:`~pytest.FixtureRequest` is now an abstract class which can't be instantiated directly.
  A new concrete ``TopRequest`` subclass of ``FixtureRequest`` has been added for the ``request`` fixture in test functions,
  as counterpart to the existing ``SubRequest`` subclass for the ``request`` fixture in fixture functions.


- `#11315 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11315>`_: The :fixture:`pytester` fixture now uses the :fixture:`monkeypatch` fixture to manage the current working directory.
  If you use ``pytester`` in combination with :func:`monkeypatch.undo() <pytest.MonkeyPatch.undo>`, the CWD might get restored.
  Use :func:`monkeypatch.context() <pytest.MonkeyPatch.context>` instead.


- `#11333 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11333>`_: Corrected the spelling of ``Config.ArgsSource.INVOCATION_DIR``.
  The previous spelling ``INCOVATION_DIR`` remains as an alias.


- `#11638 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11638>`_: Fixed the selftests to pass correctly if ``FORCE_COLOR``, ``NO_COLOR`` or ``PY_COLORS`` is set in the calling environment.

pytest 7.4.4 (2023-12-31)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#11140 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11140>`_: Fix non-string constants at the top of file being detected as docstrings on Python>=3.8.


- `#11572 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11572>`_: Handle an edge case where :data:`sys.stderr` and :data:`sys.__stderr__` might already be closed when :ref:`faulthandler` is tearing down.


- `#11710 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11710>`_: Fixed tracebacks from collection errors not getting pruned.


- `#7966 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7966>`_: Removed unhelpful error message from assertion rewrite mechanism when exceptions are raised in ``__iter__`` methods. Now they are treated un-iterable instead.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `#11091 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11091>`_: Updated documentation to refer to hyphenated options: replaced ``--junitxml`` with ``--junit-xml`` and ``--collectonly`` with ``--collect-only``.


pytest 7.4.3 (2023-10-24)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#10447 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10447>`_: Markers are now considered in the reverse mro order to ensure base  class markers are considered first -- this resolves a regression.


- `#11239 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11239>`_: Fixed ``:=`` in asserts impacting unrelated test cases.


- `#11439 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11439>`_: Handled an edge case where :data:`sys.stderr` might already be closed when :ref:`faulthandler` is tearing down.


pytest 7.4.2 (2023-09-07)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#11237 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11237>`_: Fix doctest collection of `functools.cached_property` objects.


- `#11306 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11306>`_: Fixed bug using ``--importmode=importlib`` which would cause package ``__init__.py`` files to be imported more than once in some cases.


- `#11367 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11367>`_: Fixed bug where `user_properties` where not being saved in the JUnit XML file if a fixture failed during teardown.


- `#11394 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11394>`_: Fixed crash when parsing long command line arguments that might be interpreted as files.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `#11391 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11391>`_: Improved disclaimer on pytest plugin reference page to better indicate this is an automated, non-curated listing.


pytest 7.4.1 (2023-09-02)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#10337 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10337>`_: Fixed bug where fake intermediate modules generated by ``--import-mode=importlib`` would not include the
  child modules as attributes of the parent modules.


- `#10702 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10702>`_: Fixed error assertion handling in :func:`pytest.approx` when ``None`` is an expected or received value when comparing dictionaries.


- `#10811 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10811>`_: Fixed issue when using ``--import-mode=importlib`` together with ``--doctest-modules`` that caused modules
  to be imported more than once, causing problems with modules that have import side effects.


pytest 7.4.0 (2023-06-23)
=========================

Features
--------

- `#10901 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10901>`_: Added :func:`ExceptionInfo.from_exception() <pytest.ExceptionInfo.from_exception>`, a simpler way to create an :class:`~pytest.ExceptionInfo` from an exception.
  This can replace :func:`ExceptionInfo.from_exc_info() <pytest.ExceptionInfo.from_exc_info()>` for most uses.



Improvements
------------

- `#10872 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10872>`_: Update test log report annotation to named tuple and fixed inconsistency in docs for :hook:`pytest_report_teststatus` hook.


- `#10907 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10907>`_: When an exception traceback to be displayed is completely filtered out (by mechanisms such as ``__tracebackhide__``, internal frames, and similar), now only the exception string and the following message are shown:

  "All traceback entries are hidden. Pass `--full-trace` to see hidden and internal frames.".

  Previously, the last frame of the traceback was shown, even though it was hidden.


- `#10940 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10940>`_: Improved verbose output (``-vv``) of ``skip`` and ``xfail`` reasons by performing text wrapping while leaving a clear margin for progress output.

  Added ``TerminalReporter.wrap_write()`` as a helper for that.


- `#10991 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10991>`_: Added handling of ``%f`` directive to print microseconds in log format options, such as ``log-date-format``.


- `#11005 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11005>`_: Added the underlying exception to the cache provider's path creation and write warning messages.


- `#11013 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11013>`_: Added warning when :confval:`testpaths` is set, but paths are not found by glob. In this case, pytest will fall back to searching from the current directory.


- `#11043 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11043>`_: When `--confcutdir` is not specified, and there is no config file present, the conftest cutoff directory (`--confcutdir`) is now set to the :ref:`rootdir <rootdir>`.
  Previously in such cases, `conftest.py` files would be probed all the way to the root directory of the filesystem.
  If you are badly affected by this change, consider adding an empty config file to your desired cutoff directory, or explicitly set `--confcutdir`.


- `#11081 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11081>`_: The :confval:`norecursedirs` check is now performed in a :hook:`pytest_ignore_collect` implementation, so plugins can affect it.

  If after updating to this version you see that your `norecursedirs` setting is not being respected,
  it means that a conftest or a plugin you use has a bad `pytest_ignore_collect` implementation.
  Most likely, your hook returns `False` for paths it does not want to ignore,
  which ends the processing and doesn't allow other plugins, including pytest itself, to ignore the path.
  The fix is to return `None` instead of `False` for paths your hook doesn't want to ignore.


- `#8711 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8711>`_: :func:`caplog.set_level() <pytest.LogCaptureFixture.set_level>` and :func:`caplog.at_level() <pytest.LogCaptureFixture.at_level>`
  will temporarily enable the requested ``level`` if ``level`` was disabled globally via
  ``logging.disable(LEVEL)``.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `#10831 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10831>`_: Terminal Reporting: Fixed bug when running in ``--tb=line`` mode where ``pytest.fail(pytrace=False)`` tests report ``None``.


- `#11068 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11068>`_: Fixed the ``--last-failed`` whole-file skipping functionality ("skipped N files") for :ref:`non-python test files <non-python tests>`.


- `#11104 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11104>`_: Fixed a regression in pytest 7.3.2 which caused to :confval:`testpaths` to be considered for loading initial conftests,
  even when it was not utilized (e.g. when explicit paths were given on the command line).
  Now the ``testpaths`` are only considered when they are in use.


- `#1904 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1904>`_: Fixed traceback entries hidden with ``__tracebackhide__ = True`` still being shown for chained exceptions (parts after "... the above exception ..." message).


- `#7781 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7781>`_: Fix writing non-encodable text to log file when using ``--debug``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `#9146 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9146>`_: Improved documentation for :func:`caplog.set_level() <pytest.LogCaptureFixture.set_level>`.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `#11031 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11031>`_: Enhanced the CLI flag for ``-c`` to now include ``--config-file`` to make it clear that this flag applies to the usage of a custom config file.


pytest 7.3.2 (2023-06-10)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#10169 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10169>`_: Fix bug where very long option names could cause pytest to break with ``OSError: [Errno 36] File name too long`` on some systems.


- `#10894 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10894>`_: Support for Python 3.12 (beta at the time of writing).


- `#10987 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10987>`_: :confval:`testpaths` is now honored to load root ``conftests``.


- `#10999 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10999>`_: The `monkeypatch` `setitem`/`delitem` type annotations now allow `TypedDict` arguments.


- `#11028 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11028>`_: Fixed bug in assertion rewriting where a variable assigned with the walrus operator could not be used later in a function call.


- `#11054 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11054>`_: Fixed ``--last-failed``'s "(skipped N files)" functionality for files inside of packages (directories with `__init__.py` files).


pytest 7.3.1 (2023-04-14)
=========================

Improvements
------------

- `#10875 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10875>`_: Python 3.12 support: fixed ``RuntimeError: TestResult has no addDuration method`` when running ``unittest`` tests.


- `#10890 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10890>`_: Python 3.12 support: fixed ``shutil.rmtree(onerror=...)`` deprecation warning when using :fixture:`tmp_path`.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `#10896 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10896>`_: Fixed performance regression related to :fixture:`tmp_path` and the new :confval:`tmp_path_retention_policy` option.


- `#10903 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10903>`_: Fix crash ``INTERNALERROR IndexError: list index out of range`` which happens when displaying an exception where all entries are hidden.
  This reverts the change "Correctly handle ``__tracebackhide__`` for chained exceptions." introduced in version 7.3.0.


pytest 7.3.0 (2023-04-08)
=========================

Features
--------

- `#10525 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10525>`_: Test methods decorated with ``@classmethod`` can now be discovered as tests, following the same rules as normal methods. This fills the gap that static methods were discoverable as tests but not class methods.


- `#10755 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10755>`_: :confval:`console_output_style` now supports ``progress-even-when-capture-no`` to force the use of the progress output even when capture is disabled. This is useful in large test suites where capture may have significant performance impact.


- `#7431 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7431>`_: ``--log-disable`` CLI option added to disable individual loggers.


- `#8141 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8141>`_: Added :confval:`tmp_path_retention_count` and :confval:`tmp_path_retention_policy` configuration options to control how directories created by the :fixture:`tmp_path` fixture are kept.



Improvements
------------

- `#10226 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10226>`_: If multiple errors are raised in teardown, we now re-raise an ``ExceptionGroup`` of them instead of discarding all but the last.


- `#10658 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10658>`_: Allow ``-p`` arguments to include spaces (eg: ``-p no:logging`` instead of
  ``-pno:logging``). Mostly useful in the ``addopts`` section of the configuration
  file.


- `#10710 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10710>`_: Added ``start`` and ``stop`` timestamps to ``TestReport`` objects.


- `#10727 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10727>`_: Split the report header for ``rootdir``, ``config file`` and ``testpaths`` so each has its own line.


- `#10840 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10840>`_: pytest should no longer crash on AST with pathological position attributes, for example testing AST produced by `Hylang <https://github.com/hylang/hy>__`.


- `#6267 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6267>`_: The full output of a test is no longer truncated if the truncation message would be longer than
  the hidden text. The line number shown has also been fixed.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `#10743 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10743>`_: The assertion rewriting mechanism now works correctly when assertion expressions contain the walrus operator.


- `#10765 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10765>`_: Fixed :fixture:`tmp_path` fixture always raising :class:`OSError` on ``emscripten`` platform due to missing :func:`os.getuid`.


- `#1904 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1904>`_: Correctly handle ``__tracebackhide__`` for chained exceptions.
  NOTE: This change was reverted in version 7.3.1.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `#10782 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10782>`_: Fixed the minimal example in :ref:`goodpractices`: ``pip install -e .`` requires a ``version`` entry in ``pyproject.toml`` to run successfully.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `#10669 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10669>`_: pytest no longer directly depends on the `attrs <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/>`__ package. While
  we at pytest all love the package dearly and would like to thank the ``attrs`` team for many years of cooperation and support,
  it makes sense for ``pytest`` to have as little external dependencies as possible, as this helps downstream projects.
  With that in mind, we have replaced the pytest's limited internal usage to use the standard library's ``dataclasses`` instead.

  Nice diffs for ``attrs`` classes are still supported though.


pytest 7.2.2 (2023-03-03)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#10533 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10533>`_: Fixed :func:`pytest.approx` handling of dictionaries containing one or more values of `0.0`.


- `#10592 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10592>`_: Fixed crash if `--cache-show` and `--help` are passed at the same time.


- `#10597 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10597>`_: Fixed bug where a fixture method named ``teardown`` would be called as part of ``nose`` teardown stage.


- `#10626 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10626>`_: Fixed crash if ``--fixtures`` and ``--help`` are passed at the same time.


- `#10660 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10660>`_: Fixed :py:func:`pytest.raises` to return a 'ContextManager' so that type-checkers could narrow
  :code:`pytest.raises(...) if ... else nullcontext()` down to 'ContextManager' rather than 'object'.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `#10690 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10690>`_: Added `CI` and `BUILD_NUMBER` environment variables to the documentation.


- `#10721 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10721>`_: Fixed entry-points declaration in the documentation example using Hatch.


- `#10753 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10753>`_: Changed wording of the module level skip to be very explicit
  about not collecting tests and not executing the rest of the module.


pytest 7.2.1 (2023-01-13)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#10452 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10452>`_: Fix 'importlib.abc.TraversableResources' deprecation warning in Python 3.12.


- `#10457 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10457>`_: If a test is skipped from inside a fixture, the test summary now shows the test location instead of the fixture location.


- `#10506 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10506>`_: Fix bug where sometimes pytest would use the file system root directory as :ref:`rootdir <rootdir>` on Windows.


- `#10607 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10607>`_: Fix a race condition when creating junitxml reports, which could occur when multiple instances of pytest execute in parallel.


- `#10641 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10641>`_: Fix a race condition when creating or updating the stepwise plugin's cache, which could occur when multiple xdist worker nodes try to simultaneously update the stepwise plugin's cache.


pytest 7.2.0 (2022-10-23)
=========================

Deprecations
------------

- `#10012 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10012>`_: Update ``pytest.PytestUnhandledCoroutineWarning`` to a deprecation; it will raise an error in pytest 8.


- `#10396 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10396>`_: pytest no longer depends on the ``py`` library.  ``pytest`` provides a vendored copy of ``py.error`` and ``py.path`` modules but will use the ``py`` library if it is installed.  If you need other ``py.*`` modules, continue to install the deprecated ``py`` library separately, otherwise it can usually be removed as a dependency.


- `#4562 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4562>`_: Deprecate configuring hook specs/impls using attributes/marks.

  Instead use :py:func:`pytest.hookimpl` and :py:func:`pytest.hookspec`.
  For more details, see the :ref:`docs <legacy-path-hooks-deprecated>`.


- `#9886 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9886>`_: The functionality for running tests written for ``nose`` has been officially deprecated.

  This includes:

  * Plain ``setup`` and ``teardown`` functions and methods: this might catch users by surprise, as ``setup()`` and ``teardown()`` are not pytest idioms, but part of the ``nose`` support.
  * Setup/teardown using the `@with_setup <with-setup-nose>`_ decorator.

  For more details, consult the :ref:`deprecation docs <nose-deprecation>`.

  .. _`with-setup-nose`: https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing_tools.html?highlight=with_setup#nose.tools.with_setup

- `#7337 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7337>`_: A deprecation warning is now emitted if a test function returns something other than `None`. This prevents a common mistake among beginners that expect that returning a `bool` (for example `return foo(a, b) == result`) would cause a test to pass or fail, instead of using `assert`. The plan is to make returning non-`None` from tests an error in the future.


Features
--------

- `#9897 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9897>`_: Added shell-style wildcard support to ``testpaths``.



Improvements
------------

- `#10218 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10218>`_: ``@pytest.mark.parametrize()`` (and similar functions) now accepts any ``Sequence[str]`` for the argument names,
  instead of just ``list[str]`` and ``tuple[str, ...]``.

  (Note that ``str``, which is itself a ``Sequence[str]``, is still treated as a
  comma-delimited name list, as before).


- `#10381 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10381>`_: The ``--no-showlocals`` flag has been added. This can be passed directly to tests to override ``--showlocals`` declared through ``addopts``.


- `#3426 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3426>`_: Assertion failures with strings in NFC and NFD forms that normalize to the same string now have a dedicated error message detailing the issue, and their utf-8 representation is expressed instead.


- `#8508 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8508>`_: Introduce multiline display for warning matching  via :py:func:`pytest.warns` and
  enhance match comparison for :py:func:`pytest.ExceptionInfo.match` as returned by :py:func:`pytest.raises`.


- `#8646 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8646>`_: Improve :py:func:`pytest.raises`. Previously passing an empty tuple would give a confusing
  error. We now raise immediately with a more helpful message.


- `#9741 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9741>`_: On Python 3.11, use the standard library's :mod:`tomllib` to parse TOML.

  `tomli` is no longer a dependency on Python 3.11.


- `#9742 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9742>`_: Display assertion message without escaped newline characters with ``-vv``.


- `#9823 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9823>`_: Improved error message that is shown when no collector is found for a given file.


- `#9873 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9873>`_: Some coloring has been added to the short test summary.


- `#9883 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9883>`_: Normalize the help description of all command-line options.


- `#9920 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9920>`_: Display full crash messages in ``short test summary info``, when running in a CI environment.


- `#9987 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9987>`_: Added support for hidden configuration file by allowing ``.pytest.ini`` as an alternative to ``pytest.ini``.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `#10150 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10150>`_: :data:`sys.stdin` now contains all expected methods of a file-like object when capture is enabled.


- `#10382 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10382>`_: Do not break into pdb when ``raise unittest.SkipTest()`` appears top-level in a file.


- `#7792 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7792>`_: Marks are now inherited according to the full MRO in test classes. Previously, if a test class inherited from two or more classes, only marks from the first super-class would apply.

  When inheriting marks from super-classes, marks from the sub-classes are now ordered before marks from the super-classes, in MRO order. Previously it was the reverse.

  When inheriting marks from super-classes, the `pytestmark` attribute of the sub-class now only contains the marks directly applied to it. Previously, it also contained marks from its super-classes. Please note that this attribute should not normally be accessed directly; use :func:`Node.iter_markers <_pytest.nodes.Node.iter_markers>` instead.


- `#9159 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9159>`_: Showing inner exceptions by forcing native display in ``ExceptionGroups`` even when using display options other than ``--tb=native``. A temporary step before full implementation of pytest-native display for inner exceptions in ``ExceptionGroups``.


- `#9877 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9877>`_: Ensure ``caplog.get_records(when)`` returns current/correct data after invoking ``caplog.clear()``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `#10344 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10344>`_: Update information on writing plugins to use ``pyproject.toml`` instead of ``setup.py``.


- `#9248 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9248>`_: The documentation is now built using Sphinx 5.x (up from 3.x previously).


- `#9291 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9291>`_: Update documentation on how :func:`pytest.warns` affects :class:`DeprecationWarning`.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `#10313 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10313>`_: Made ``_pytest.doctest.DoctestItem`` export ``pytest.DoctestItem`` for
  type check and runtime purposes. Made `_pytest.doctest` use internal APIs
  to avoid circular imports.


- `#9906 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9906>`_: Made ``_pytest.compat`` re-export ``importlib_metadata`` in the eyes of type checkers.


- `#9910 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9910>`_: Fix default encoding warning (``EncodingWarning``) in ``cacheprovider``


- `#9984 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9984>`_: Improve the error message when we attempt to access a fixture that has been
  torn down.
  Add an additional sentence to the docstring explaining when it's not a good
  idea to call ``getfixturevalue``.


pytest 7.1.3 (2022-08-31)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#10060 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10060>`_: When running with ``--pdb``, ``TestCase.tearDown`` is no longer called for tests when the *class* has been skipped via ``unittest.skip`` or ``pytest.mark.skip``.


- `#10190 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10190>`_: Invalid XML characters in setup or teardown error messages are now properly escaped for JUnit XML reports.


- `#10230 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10230>`_: Ignore ``.py`` files created by ``pyproject.toml``-based editable builds introduced in `pip 21.3 <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#v21-3>`__.


- `#3396 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3396>`_: Doctests now respect the ``--import-mode`` flag.


- `#9514 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9514>`_: Type-annotate ``FixtureRequest.param`` as ``Any`` as a stop gap measure until :issue:`8073` is fixed.


- `#9791 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9791>`_: Fixed a path handling code in ``rewrite.py`` that seems to work fine, but was incorrect and fails in some systems.


- `#9917 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9917>`_: Fixed string representation for :func:`pytest.approx` when used to compare tuples.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `#9937 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9937>`_: Explicit note that :fixture:`tmpdir` fixture is discouraged in favour of :fixture:`tmp_path`.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `#10114 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10114>`_: Replace `atomicwrites <https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites>`__ dependency on windows with `os.replace`.


pytest 7.1.2 (2022-04-23)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#9726 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9726>`_: An unnecessary ``numpy`` import inside :func:`pytest.approx` was removed.


- `#9820 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9820>`_: Fix comparison of  ``dataclasses`` with ``InitVar``.


- `#9869 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9869>`_: Increase ``stacklevel`` for the ``NODE_CTOR_FSPATH_ARG`` deprecation to point to the
  user's code, not pytest.


- `#9871 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9871>`_: Fix a bizarre (and fortunately rare) bug where the `temp_path` fixture could raise
  an internal error while attempting to get the current user's username.


pytest 7.1.1 (2022-03-17)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#9767 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9767>`_: Fixed a regression in pytest 7.1.0 where some conftest.py files outside of the source tree (e.g. in the `site-packages` directory) were not picked up.


pytest 7.1.0 (2022-03-13)
=========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

- `#8838 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8838>`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 6.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``pytest._fillfuncargs`` function.

  * ``pytest_warning_captured`` hook - use ``pytest_warning_recorded`` instead.

  * ``-k -foobar`` syntax - use ``-k 'not foobar'`` instead.

  * ``-k foobar:`` syntax.

  * ``pytest.collect`` module - import from ``pytest`` directly.

  For more information consult
  `Deprecations and Removals <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html>`__ in the docs.


- `#9437 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9437>`_: Dropped support for Python 3.6, which reached `end-of-life <https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches>`__ at 2021-12-23.



Improvements
------------

- `#5192 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5192>`_: Fixed test output for some data types where ``-v`` would show less information.

  Also, when showing diffs for sequences, ``-q`` would produce full diffs instead of the expected diff.


- `#9362 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9362>`_: pytest now avoids specialized assert formatting when it is detected that the default ``__eq__`` is overridden in ``attrs`` or ``dataclasses``.


- `#9536 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9536>`_: When ``-vv`` is given on command line, show skipping and xfail reasons in full instead of truncating them to fit the terminal width.


- `#9644 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9644>`_: More information about the location of resources that led Python to raise :class:`ResourceWarning` can now
  be obtained by enabling :mod:`tracemalloc`.

  See :ref:`resource-warnings` for more information.


- `#9678 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9678>`_: More types are now accepted in the ``ids`` argument to ``@pytest.mark.parametrize``.
  Previously only `str`, `float`, `int` and `bool` were accepted;
  now `bytes`, `complex`, `re.Pattern`, `Enum` and anything with a `__name__` are also accepted.


- `#9692 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9692>`_: :func:`pytest.approx` now raises a :class:`TypeError` when given an unordered sequence (such as :class:`set`).

  Note that this implies that custom classes which only implement ``__iter__`` and ``__len__`` are no longer supported as they don't guarantee order.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `#8242 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8242>`_: The deprecation of raising :class:`unittest.SkipTest` to skip collection of
  tests during the pytest collection phase is reverted - this is now a supported
  feature again.


- `#9493 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9493>`_: Symbolic link components are no longer resolved in conftest paths.
  This means that if a conftest appears twice in collection tree, using symlinks, it will be executed twice.
  For example, given

      tests/real/conftest.py
      tests/real/test_it.py
      tests/link -> tests/real

  running ``pytest tests`` now imports the conftest twice, once as ``tests/real/conftest.py`` and once as ``tests/link/conftest.py``.
  This is a fix to match a similar change made to test collection itself in pytest 6.0 (see :pr:`6523` for details).


- `#9626 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9626>`_: Fixed count of selected tests on terminal collection summary when there were errors or skipped modules.

  If there were errors or skipped modules on collection, pytest would mistakenly subtract those from the selected count.


- `#9645 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9645>`_: Fixed regression where ``--import-mode=importlib`` used together with :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` or :confval:`pythonpath` would cause import errors in test suites.


- `#9708 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9708>`_: :fixture:`pytester` now requests a :fixture:`monkeypatch` fixture instead of creating one internally. This solves some issues with tests that involve pytest environment variables.


- `#9730 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9730>`_: Malformed ``pyproject.toml`` files now produce a clearer error message.


pytest 7.0.1 (2022-02-11)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#9608 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9608>`_: Fix invalid importing of ``importlib.readers`` in Python 3.9.


- `#9610 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9610>`_: Restore `UnitTestFunction.obj` to return unbound rather than bound method.
  Fixes a crash during a failed teardown in unittest TestCases with non-default `__init__`.
  Regressed in pytest 7.0.0.


- `#9636 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9636>`_: The ``pythonpath`` plugin was renamed to ``python_path``. This avoids a conflict with the ``pytest-pythonpath`` plugin.


- `#9642 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9642>`_: Fix running tests by id with ``::`` in the parametrize portion.


- `#9643 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9643>`_: Delay issuing a :class:`~pytest.PytestWarning` about diamond inheritance involving :class:`~pytest.Item` and
  :class:`~pytest.Collector` so it can be filtered using :ref:`standard warning filters <warnings>`.


pytest 7.0.0 (2022-02-03)
=========================

(**Please see the full set of changes for this release also in the 7.0.0rc1 notes below**)

Deprecations
------------

- `#9488 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9488>`_: If custom subclasses of nodes like :class:`pytest.Item` override the
  ``__init__`` method, they should take ``**kwargs``. See
  :ref:`uncooperative-constructors-deprecated` for details.

  Note that a deprecation warning is only emitted when there is a conflict in the
  arguments pytest expected to pass. This deprecation was already part of pytest
  7.0.0rc1 but wasn't documented.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `#9355 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9355>`_: Fixed error message prints function decorators when using assert in Python 3.8 and above.


- `#9396 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9396>`_: Ensure `pytest.Config.inifile` is available during the :hook:`pytest_cmdline_main` hook (regression during ``7.0.0rc1``).



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `#9404 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9404>`_: Added extra documentation on alternatives to common misuses of `pytest.warns(None)` ahead of its deprecation.


- `#9505 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9505>`_: Clarify where the configuration files are located. To avoid confusions documentation mentions
  that configuration file is located in the root of the repository.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `#9521 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9521>`_: Add test coverage to assertion rewrite path.


pytest 7.0.0rc1 (2021-12-06)
============================

Breaking Changes
----------------

- `#7259 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7259>`_: The :ref:`Node.reportinfo() <non-python tests>` function first return value type has been expanded from `py.path.local | str` to `os.PathLike[str] | str`.

  Most plugins which refer to `reportinfo()` only define it as part of a custom :class:`pytest.Item` implementation.
  Since `py.path.local` is an `os.PathLike[str]`, these plugins are unaffected.

  Plugins and users which call `reportinfo()`, use the first return value and interact with it as a `py.path.local`, would need to adjust by calling `py.path.local(fspath)`.
  Although preferably, avoid the legacy `py.path.local` and use `pathlib.Path`, or use `item.location` or `item.path`, instead.

  Note: pytest was not able to provide a deprecation period for this change.


- `#8246 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8246>`_: ``--version`` now writes version information to ``stdout`` rather than ``stderr``.


- `#8733 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8733>`_: Drop a workaround for `pyreadline <https://github.com/pyreadline/pyreadline>`__ that made it work with ``--pdb``.

  The workaround was introduced in `#1281 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/1281>`__ in 2015, however since then
  `pyreadline seems to have gone unmaintained <https://github.com/pyreadline/pyreadline/issues/58>`__, is `generating
  warnings <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8847>`__, and will stop working on Python 3.10.


- `#9061 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9061>`_: Using :func:`pytest.approx` in a boolean context now raises an error hinting at the proper usage.

  It is apparently common for users to mistakenly use ``pytest.approx`` like this:

  .. code-block:: python

      assert pytest.approx(actual, expected)

  While the correct usage is:

  .. code-block:: python

      assert actual == pytest.approx(expected)

  The new error message helps catch those mistakes.


- `#9277 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9277>`_: The ``pytest.Instance`` collector type has been removed.
  Importing ``pytest.Instance`` or ``_pytest.python.Instance`` returns a dummy type and emits a deprecation warning.
  See :ref:`instance-collector-deprecation` for details.


- `#9308 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9308>`_: **PytestRemovedIn7Warning deprecation warnings are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestRemovedIn7Warning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages by default.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 7.1**, so please consult the
  :ref:`deprecations` section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``7.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a
  stopgap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestRemovedIn7Warning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``7.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to :issue:`9308`.



Deprecations
------------

- `#7259 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7259>`_: ``py.path.local`` arguments for hooks have been deprecated. See :ref:`the deprecation note <legacy-path-hooks-deprecated>` for full details.

  ``py.path.local`` arguments to Node constructors have been deprecated. See :ref:`the deprecation note <node-ctor-fspath-deprecation>` for full details.

  .. note::
      The name of the :class:`~_pytest.nodes.Node` arguments and attributes (the
      new attribute being ``path``) is **the opposite** of the situation for hooks
      (the old argument being ``path``).

      This is an unfortunate artifact due to historical reasons, which should be
      resolved in future versions as we slowly get rid of the :pypi:`py`
      dependency (see :issue:`9283` for a longer discussion).


- `#7469 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7469>`_: Directly constructing the following classes is now deprecated:

  - ``_pytest.mark.structures.Mark``
  - ``_pytest.mark.structures.MarkDecorator``
  - ``_pytest.mark.structures.MarkGenerator``
  - ``_pytest.python.Metafunc``
  - ``_pytest.runner.CallInfo``
  - ``_pytest._code.ExceptionInfo``
  - ``_pytest.config.argparsing.Parser``
  - ``_pytest.config.argparsing.OptionGroup``
  - ``_pytest.pytester.HookRecorder``

  These constructors have always been considered private, but now issue a deprecation warning, which may become a hard error in pytest 8.


- `#8242 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8242>`_: Raising :class:`unittest.SkipTest` to skip collection of tests during the
  pytest collection phase is deprecated. Use :func:`pytest.skip` instead.

  Note: This deprecation only relates to using :class:`unittest.SkipTest` during test
  collection. You are probably not doing that. Ordinary usage of
  :class:`unittest.SkipTest` / :meth:`unittest.TestCase.skipTest` /
  :func:`unittest.skip` in unittest test cases is fully supported.

  .. note:: This deprecation has been reverted in pytest 7.1.0.


- `#8315 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8315>`_: Several behaviors of :meth:`Parser.addoption <pytest.Parser.addoption>` are now
  scheduled for removal in pytest 8 (deprecated since pytest 2.4.0):

  - ``parser.addoption(..., help=".. %default ..")`` - use ``%(default)s`` instead.
  - ``parser.addoption(..., type="int/string/float/complex")`` - use ``type=int`` etc. instead.


- `#8447 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8447>`_: Defining a custom pytest node type which is both an :class:`~pytest.Item` and a :class:`~pytest.Collector` (e.g. :class:`~pytest.File`) now issues a warning.
  It was never sanely supported and triggers hard to debug errors.

  See :ref:`the deprecation note <diamond-inheritance-deprecated>` for full details.


- `#8592 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8592>`_: ``pytest_cmdline_preparse`` has been officially deprecated.  It will be removed in a future release.  Use :hook:`pytest_load_initial_conftests` instead.

  See :ref:`the deprecation note <cmdline-preparse-deprecated>` for full details.


- `#8645 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8645>`_: :func:`pytest.warns(None) <pytest.warns>` is now deprecated because many people used
  it to mean "this code does not emit warnings", but it actually had the effect of
  checking that the code emits at least one warning of any type - like ``pytest.warns()``
  or ``pytest.warns(Warning)``.


- `#8948 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8948>`_: :func:`pytest.skip(msg=...) <pytest.skip>`, :func:`pytest.fail(msg=...) <pytest.fail>` and :func:`pytest.exit(msg=...) <pytest.exit>`
  signatures now accept a ``reason`` argument instead of ``msg``.  Using ``msg`` still works, but is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

  This was changed for consistency with :func:`pytest.mark.skip <pytest.mark.skip>` and  :func:`pytest.mark.xfail <pytest.mark.xfail>` which both accept
  ``reason`` as an argument.

- `#8174 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8174>`_: The following changes have been made to types reachable through :attr:`pytest.ExceptionInfo.traceback`:

  - The ``path`` property of ``_pytest.code.Code`` returns ``Path`` instead of ``py.path.local``.
  - The ``path`` property of ``_pytest.code.TracebackEntry`` returns ``Path`` instead of ``py.path.local``.

  There was no deprecation period for this change (sorry!).


Features
--------

- `#5196 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5196>`_: Tests are now ordered by definition order in more cases.

  In a class hierarchy, tests from base classes are now consistently ordered before tests defined on their subclasses (reverse MRO order).


- `#7132 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7132>`_: Added two environment variables :envvar:`PYTEST_THEME` and :envvar:`PYTEST_THEME_MODE` to let the users customize the pygments theme used.


- `#7259 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7259>`_: Added :meth:`cache.mkdir() <pytest.Cache.mkdir>`, which is similar to the existing ``cache.makedir()``,
  but returns a :class:`pathlib.Path` instead of a legacy ``py.path.local``.

  Added a ``paths`` type to :meth:`parser.addini() <pytest.Parser.addini>`,
  as in ``parser.addini("mypaths", "my paths", type="paths")``,
  which is similar to the existing ``pathlist``,
  but returns a list of :class:`pathlib.Path` instead of legacy ``py.path.local``.


- `#7469 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7469>`_: The types of objects used in pytest's API are now exported so they may be used in type annotations.

  The newly-exported types are:

  - ``pytest.Config`` for :class:`Config <pytest.Config>`.
  - ``pytest.Mark`` for :class:`marks <pytest.Mark>`.
  - ``pytest.MarkDecorator`` for :class:`mark decorators <pytest.MarkDecorator>`.
  - ``pytest.MarkGenerator`` for the :class:`pytest.mark <pytest.MarkGenerator>` singleton.
  - ``pytest.Metafunc`` for the :class:`metafunc <pytest.MarkGenerator>` argument to the :hook:`pytest_generate_tests` hook.
  - ``pytest.CallInfo`` for the :class:`CallInfo <pytest.CallInfo>` type passed to various hooks.
  - ``pytest.PytestPluginManager`` for :class:`PytestPluginManager <pytest.PytestPluginManager>`.
  - ``pytest.ExceptionInfo`` for the :class:`ExceptionInfo <pytest.ExceptionInfo>` type returned from :func:`pytest.raises` and passed to various hooks.
  - ``pytest.Parser`` for the :class:`Parser <pytest.Parser>` type passed to the :hook:`pytest_addoption` hook.
  - ``pytest.OptionGroup`` for the :class:`OptionGroup <pytest.OptionGroup>` type returned from the :func:`parser.addgroup <pytest.Parser.getgroup>` method.
  - ``pytest.HookRecorder`` for the :class:`HookRecorder <pytest.HookRecorder>` type returned from :class:`~pytest.Pytester`.
  - ``pytest.RecordedHookCall`` for the :class:`RecordedHookCall <pytest.HookRecorder>` type returned from :class:`~pytest.HookRecorder`.
  - ``pytest.RunResult`` for the :class:`RunResult <pytest.RunResult>` type returned from :class:`~pytest.Pytester`.
  - ``pytest.LineMatcher`` for the :class:`LineMatcher <pytest.LineMatcher>` type used in :class:`~pytest.RunResult` and others.
  - ``pytest.TestReport`` for the :class:`TestReport <pytest.TestReport>` type used in various hooks.
  - ``pytest.CollectReport`` for the :class:`CollectReport <pytest.CollectReport>` type used in various hooks.

  Constructing most of them directly is not supported; they are only meant for use in type annotations.
  Doing so will emit a deprecation warning, and may become a hard-error in pytest 8.0.

  Subclassing them is also not supported. This is not currently enforced at runtime, but is detected by type-checkers such as mypy.


- `#7856 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7856>`_: :ref:`--import-mode=importlib <import-modes>` now works with features that
  depend on modules being on :py:data:`sys.modules`, such as :mod:`pickle` and :mod:`dataclasses`.


- `#8144 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8144>`_: The following hooks now receive an additional ``pathlib.Path`` argument, equivalent to an existing ``py.path.local`` argument:

  - :hook:`pytest_ignore_collect` - The ``collection_path`` parameter (equivalent to existing ``path`` parameter).
  - :hook:`pytest_collect_file` - The ``file_path`` parameter (equivalent to existing ``path`` parameter).
  - :hook:`pytest_pycollect_makemodule` - The ``module_path`` parameter (equivalent to existing ``path`` parameter).
  - :hook:`pytest_report_header` - The ``start_path`` parameter (equivalent to existing ``startdir`` parameter).
  - :hook:`pytest_report_collectionfinish` - The ``start_path`` parameter (equivalent to existing ``startdir`` parameter).

  .. note::
      The name of the :class:`~_pytest.nodes.Node` arguments and attributes (the
      new attribute being ``path``) is **the opposite** of the situation for hooks
      (the old argument being ``path``).

      This is an unfortunate artifact due to historical reasons, which should be
      resolved in future versions as we slowly get rid of the :pypi:`py`
      dependency (see :issue:`9283` for a longer discussion).


- `#8251 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8251>`_: Implement ``Node.path`` as a ``pathlib.Path``. Both the old ``fspath`` and this new attribute gets set no matter whether ``path`` or ``fspath`` (deprecated) is passed to the constructor. It is a replacement for the ``fspath`` attribute (which represents the same path as ``py.path.local``). While ``fspath`` is not deprecated yet
  due to the ongoing migration of methods like :meth:`~pytest.Item.reportinfo`, we expect to deprecate it in a future release.

  .. note::
      The name of the :class:`~_pytest.nodes.Node` arguments and attributes (the
      new attribute being ``path``) is **the opposite** of the situation for hooks
      (the old argument being ``path``).

      This is an unfortunate artifact due to historical reasons, which should be
      resolved in future versions as we slowly get rid of the :pypi:`py`
      dependency (see :issue:`9283` for a longer discussion).


- `#8421 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8421>`_: :func:`pytest.approx` now works on :class:`~decimal.Decimal` within mappings/dicts and sequences/lists.


- `#8606 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8606>`_: pytest invocations with ``--fixtures-per-test`` and ``--fixtures`` have been enriched with:

  - Fixture location path printed with the fixture name.
  - First section of the fixture's docstring printed under the fixture name.
  - Whole of fixture's docstring printed under the fixture name using ``--verbose`` option.


- `#8761 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8761>`_: New :ref:`version-tuple` attribute, which makes it simpler for users to do something depending on the pytest version (such as declaring hooks which are introduced in later versions).


- `#8789 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8789>`_: Switch TOML parser from ``toml`` to ``tomli`` for TOML v1.0.0 support in ``pyproject.toml``.


- `#8920 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8920>`_: Added :class:`pytest.Stash`, a facility for plugins to store their data on :class:`~pytest.Config` and :class:`~_pytest.nodes.Node`\s in a type-safe and conflict-free manner.
  See :ref:`plugin-stash` for details.


- `#8953 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8953>`_: :class:`~pytest.RunResult` method :meth:`~pytest.RunResult.assert_outcomes` now accepts a
  ``warnings`` argument to assert the total number of warnings captured.


- `#8954 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8954>`_: ``--debug`` flag now accepts a :class:`str` file to route debug logs into, remains defaulted to `pytestdebug.log`.


- `#9023 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9023>`_: Full diffs are now always shown for equality assertions of iterables when
  `CI` or ``BUILD_NUMBER`` is found in the environment, even when ``-v`` isn't
  used.


- `#9113 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9113>`_: :class:`~pytest.RunResult` method :meth:`~pytest.RunResult.assert_outcomes` now accepts a
  ``deselected`` argument to assert the total number of deselected tests.


- `#9114 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9114>`_: Added :confval:`pythonpath` setting that adds listed paths to :data:`sys.path` for the duration of the test session. If you currently use the pytest-pythonpath or pytest-srcpaths plugins, you should be able to replace them with built-in `pythonpath` setting.



Improvements
------------

- `#7480 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7480>`_: A deprecation scheduled to be removed in a major version X (e.g. pytest 7, 8, 9, ...) now uses warning category `PytestRemovedInXWarning`,
  a subclass of :class:`~pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning`,
  instead of :class:`~pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning` directly.

  See :ref:`backwards-compatibility` for more details.


- `#7864 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7864>`_: Improved error messages when parsing warning filters.

  Previously pytest would show an internal traceback, which besides being ugly sometimes would hide the cause
  of the problem (for example an ``ImportError`` while importing a specific warning type).


- `#8335 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8335>`_: Improved :func:`pytest.approx` assertion messages for sequences of numbers.

  The assertion messages now dumps a table with the index and the error of each diff.
  Example::

      >       assert [1, 2, 3, 4] == pytest.approx([1, 3, 3, 5])
      E       assert comparison failed for 2 values:
      E         Index | Obtained | Expected
      E         1     | 2        | 3 +- 3.0e-06
      E         3     | 4        | 5 +- 5.0e-06


- `#8403 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8403>`_: By default, pytest will truncate long strings in assert errors so they don't clutter the output too much,
  currently at ``240`` characters by default.

  However, in some cases the longer output helps, or is even crucial, to diagnose a failure. Using ``-v`` will
  now increase the truncation threshold to ``2400`` characters, and ``-vv`` or higher will disable truncation entirely.


- `#8509 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8509>`_: Fixed issue where :meth:`unittest.TestCase.setUpClass` is not called when a test has `/` in its name since pytest 6.2.0.

  This refers to the path part in pytest node IDs, e.g. ``TestClass::test_it`` in the node ID ``tests/test_file.py::TestClass::test_it``.

  Now, instead of assuming that the test name does not contain ``/``, it is assumed that test path does not contain ``::``. We plan to hopefully make both of these work in the future.


- `#8803 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8803>`_: It is now possible to add colors to custom log levels on cli log.

  By using ``add_color_level`` from a :hook:`pytest_configure` hook, colors can be added::

      logging_plugin = config.pluginmanager.get_plugin('logging-plugin')
      logging_plugin.log_cli_handler.formatter.add_color_level(logging.INFO, 'cyan')
      logging_plugin.log_cli_handler.formatter.add_color_level(logging.SPAM, 'blue')

  See :ref:`log_colors` for more information.


- `#8822 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8822>`_: When showing fixture paths in `--fixtures` or `--fixtures-by-test`, fixtures coming from pytest itself now display an elided path, rather than the full path to the file in the `site-packages` directory.


- `#8898 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8898>`_: Complex numbers are now treated like floats and integers when generating parameterization IDs.


- `#9062 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9062>`_: ``--stepwise-skip`` now implicitly enables ``--stepwise`` and can be used on its own.


- `#9205 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9205>`_: :meth:`pytest.Cache.set` now preserves key order when saving dicts.



Bug Fixes
---------

- `#7124 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7124>`_: Fixed an issue where ``__main__.py`` would raise an ``ImportError`` when ``--doctest-modules`` was provided.


- `#8061 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8061>`_: Fixed failing ``staticmethod`` test cases if they are inherited from a parent test class.


- `#8192 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8192>`_: ``testdir.makefile`` now silently accepts values which don't start with ``.`` to maintain backward compatibility with older pytest versions.

  ``pytester.makefile`` now issues a clearer error if the ``.`` is missing in the ``ext`` argument.


- `#8258 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8258>`_: Fixed issue where pytest's ``faulthandler`` support would not dump traceback on crashes
  if the :mod:`faulthandler` module was already enabled during pytest startup (using
  ``python -X dev -m pytest`` for example).


- `#8317 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8317>`_: Fixed an issue where illegal directory characters derived from ``getpass.getuser()`` raised an ``OSError``.


- `#8367 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8367>`_: Fix ``Class.from_parent`` so it forwards extra keyword arguments to the constructor.


- `#8377 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8377>`_: The test selection options ``pytest -k`` and ``pytest -m`` now support matching
  names containing forward slash (``/``) characters.


- `#8384 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8384>`_: The ``@pytest.mark.skip`` decorator now correctly handles its arguments. When the ``reason`` argument is accidentally given both positional and as a keyword (e.g. because it was confused with ``skipif``), a ``TypeError`` now occurs. Before, such tests were silently skipped, and the positional argument ignored. Additionally, ``reason`` is now documented correctly as positional or keyword (rather than keyword-only).


- `#8394 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8394>`_: Use private names for internal fixtures that handle classic setup/teardown so that they don't show up with the default ``--fixtures`` invocation (but they still show up with ``--fixtures -v``).


- `#8456 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8456>`_: The :confval:`required_plugins` config option now works correctly when pre-releases of plugins are installed, rather than falsely claiming that those plugins aren't installed at all.


- `#8464 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8464>`_: ``-c <config file>`` now also properly defines ``rootdir`` as the directory that contains ``<config file>``.


- `#8503 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8503>`_: :meth:`pytest.MonkeyPatch.syspath_prepend` no longer fails when
  ``setuptools`` is not installed.
  It now only calls ``pkg_resources.fixup_namespace_packages`` if
  ``pkg_resources`` was previously imported, because it is not needed otherwise.


- `#8548 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8548>`_: Introduce fix to handle precision width in ``log-cli-format`` in turn to fix output coloring for certain formats.


- `#8796 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8796>`_: Fixed internal error when skipping doctests.


- `#8983 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8983>`_: The test selection options ``pytest -k`` and ``pytest -m`` now support matching names containing backslash (`\\`) characters.
  Backslashes are treated literally, not as escape characters (the values being matched against are already escaped).


- `#8990 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8990>`_: Fix `pytest -vv` crashing with an internal exception `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'relative_to'` in some cases.


- `#9077 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9077>`_: Fixed confusing error message when ``request.fspath`` / ``request.path`` was accessed from a session-scoped fixture.


- `#9131 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9131>`_: Fixed the URL used by ``--pastebin`` to use `bpa.st <http://bpa.st>`__.


- `#9163 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9163>`_: The end line number and end column offset are now properly set for rewritten assert statements.


- `#9169 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9169>`_: Support for the ``files`` API from ``importlib.resources`` within rewritten files.


- `#9272 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9272>`_: The nose compatibility module-level fixtures `setup()` and `teardown()` are now only called once per module, instead of for each test function.
  They are now called even if object-level `setup`/`teardown` is defined.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- `#4320 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4320>`_: Improved docs for `pytester.copy_example`.


- `#5105 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5105>`_: Add automatically generated :ref:`plugin-list`. The list is updated on a periodic schedule.


- `#8337 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8337>`_: Recommend `numpy.testing <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.testing.html>`__ module on :func:`pytest.approx` documentation.


- `#8655 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8655>`_: Help text for ``--pdbcls`` more accurately reflects the option's behavior.


- `#9210 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9210>`_: Remove incorrect docs about ``confcutdir`` being a configuration option: it can only be set through the ``--confcutdir`` command-line option.


- `#9242 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9242>`_: Upgrade readthedocs configuration to use a `newer Ubuntu version <https://blog.readthedocs.com/new-build-specification/>`__` with better unicode support for PDF docs.


- `#9341 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9341>`_: Various methods commonly used for :ref:`non-python tests` are now correctly documented in the reference docs. They were undocumented previously.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- `#8133 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8133>`_: Migrate to ``setuptools_scm`` 6.x to use ``SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION_FOR_PYTEST`` for more robust release tooling.


- `#8174 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8174>`_: The following changes have been made to internal pytest types/functions:

  - The ``_pytest.code.getfslineno()`` function returns ``Path`` instead of ``py.path.local``.
  - The ``_pytest.python.path_matches_patterns()`` function takes ``Path`` instead of ``py.path.local``.
  - The ``_pytest._code.Traceback.cut()`` function accepts any ``os.PathLike[str]``, not just ``py.path.local``.


- `#8248 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8248>`_: Internal Restructure: let ``python.PyObjMixin`` inherit from ``nodes.Node`` to carry over typing information.


- `#8432 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8432>`_: Improve error message when :func:`pytest.skip` is used at module level without passing `allow_module_level=True`.


- `#8818 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8818>`_: Ensure ``regendoc`` opts out of ``TOX_ENV`` cachedir selection to ensure independent example test runs.


- `#8913 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8913>`_: The private ``CallSpec2._arg2scopenum`` attribute has been removed after an internal refactoring.


- `#8967 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8967>`_: :hook:`pytest_assertion_pass` is no longer considered experimental and
  future changes to it will be considered more carefully.


- `#9202 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9202>`_: Add github action to upload coverage report to codecov instead of bash uploader.


- `#9225 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9225>`_: Changed the command used to create sdist and wheel artifacts: using the build package instead of setup.py.


- `#9351 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9351>`_: Correct minor typos in doc/en/example/special.rst.


pytest 6.2.5 (2021-08-29)
=========================


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`8494`: Python 3.10 is now supported.


- :issue:`9040`: Enable compatibility with ``pluggy 1.0`` or later.


pytest 6.2.4 (2021-05-04)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`8539`: Fixed assertion rewriting on Python 3.10.


pytest 6.2.3 (2021-04-03)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`8414`: pytest used to create directories under ``/tmp`` with world-readable
  permissions. This means that any user in the system was able to read
  information written by tests in temporary directories (such as those created by
  the ``tmp_path``/``tmpdir`` fixture). Now the directories are created with
  private permissions.

  pytest used to silently use a preexisting ``/tmp/pytest-of-<username>`` directory,
  even if owned by another user. This means another user could pre-create such a
  directory and gain control of another user's temporary directory. Now such a
  condition results in an error.


pytest 6.2.2 (2021-01-25)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`8152`: Fixed "(<Skipped instance>)" being shown as a skip reason in the verbose test summary line when the reason is empty.


- :issue:`8249`: Fix the ``faulthandler`` plugin for occasions when running with ``twisted.logger`` and using ``pytest --capture=no``.


pytest 6.2.1 (2020-12-15)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`7678`: Fixed bug where ``ImportPathMismatchError`` would be raised for files compiled in
  the host and loaded later from an UNC mounted path (Windows).


- :issue:`8132`: Fixed regression in ``approx``: in 6.2.0 ``approx`` no longer raises
  ``TypeError`` when dealing with non-numeric types, falling back to normal comparison.
  Before 6.2.0, array types like tf.DeviceArray fell through to the scalar case,
  and happened to compare correctly to a scalar if they had only one element.
  After 6.2.0, these types began failing, because they inherited neither from
  standard Python number hierarchy nor from ``numpy.ndarray``.

  ``approx`` now converts arguments to ``numpy.ndarray`` if they expose the array
  protocol and are not scalars. This treats array-like objects like numpy arrays,
  regardless of size.


pytest 6.2.0 (2020-12-12)
=========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

- :issue:`7808`: pytest now supports python3.6+ only.



Deprecations
------------

- :issue:`7469`: Directly constructing/calling the following classes/functions is now deprecated:

  - ``_pytest.cacheprovider.Cache``
  - ``_pytest.cacheprovider.Cache.for_config()``
  - ``_pytest.cacheprovider.Cache.clear_cache()``
  - ``_pytest.cacheprovider.Cache.cache_dir_from_config()``
  - ``_pytest.capture.CaptureFixture``
  - ``_pytest.fixtures.FixtureRequest``
  - ``_pytest.fixtures.SubRequest``
  - ``_pytest.logging.LogCaptureFixture``
  - ``_pytest.pytester.Pytester``
  - ``_pytest.pytester.Testdir``
  - ``_pytest.recwarn.WarningsRecorder``
  - ``_pytest.recwarn.WarningsChecker``
  - ``_pytest.tmpdir.TempPathFactory``
  - ``_pytest.tmpdir.TempdirFactory``

  These have always been considered private, but now issue a deprecation warning, which may become a hard error in pytest 8.0.0.


- :issue:`7530`: The ``--strict`` command-line option has been deprecated, use ``--strict-markers`` instead.

  We have plans to maybe in the future to reintroduce ``--strict`` and make it an encompassing flag for all strictness
  related options (``--strict-markers`` and ``--strict-config`` at the moment, more might be introduced in the future).


- :issue:`7988`: The ``@pytest.yield_fixture`` decorator/function is now deprecated. Use :func:`pytest.fixture` instead.

  ``yield_fixture`` has been an alias for ``fixture`` for a very long time, so can be search/replaced safely.



Features
--------

- :issue:`5299`: pytest now warns about unraisable exceptions and unhandled thread exceptions that occur in tests on Python>=3.8.
  See :ref:`unraisable` for more information.


- :issue:`7425`: New :fixture:`pytester` fixture, which is identical to :fixture:`testdir` but its methods return :class:`pathlib.Path` when appropriate instead of ``py.path.local``.

  This is part of the movement to use :class:`pathlib.Path` objects internally, in order to remove the dependency to ``py`` in the future.

  Internally, the old ``pytest.Testdir`` is now a thin wrapper around :class:`~pytest.Pytester`, preserving the old interface.


- :issue:`7695`: A new hook was added, `pytest_markeval_namespace` which should return a dictionary.
  This dictionary will be used to augment the "global" variables available to evaluate skipif/xfail/xpass markers.

  Pseudo example

  ``conftest.py``:

  .. code-block:: python

     def pytest_markeval_namespace():
         return {"color": "red"}

  ``test_func.py``:

  .. code-block:: python

     @pytest.mark.skipif("color == 'blue'", reason="Color is not red")
     def test_func():
         assert False


- :issue:`8006`: It is now possible to construct a :class:`~pytest.MonkeyPatch` object directly as ``pytest.MonkeyPatch()``,
  in cases when the :fixture:`monkeypatch` fixture cannot be used. Previously some users imported it
  from the private `_pytest.monkeypatch.MonkeyPatch` namespace.

  Additionally, :meth:`MonkeyPatch.context <pytest.MonkeyPatch.context>` is now a classmethod,
  and can be used as ``with MonkeyPatch.context() as mp: ...``. This is the recommended way to use
  ``MonkeyPatch`` directly, since unlike the ``monkeypatch`` fixture, an instance created directly
  is not ``undo()``-ed automatically.



Improvements
------------

- :issue:`1265`: Added an ``__str__`` implementation to the :class:`~pytest.LineMatcher` class which is returned from ``pytester.run_pytest().stdout`` and similar. It returns the entire output, like the existing ``str()`` method.


- :issue:`2044`: Verbose mode now shows the reason that a test was skipped in the test's terminal line after the "SKIPPED", "XFAIL" or "XPASS".


- :issue:`7469` The types of builtin pytest fixtures are now exported so they may be used in type annotations of test functions.
  The newly-exported types are:

  - ``pytest.FixtureRequest`` for the :fixture:`request` fixture.
  - ``pytest.Cache`` for the :fixture:`cache` fixture.
  - ``pytest.CaptureFixture[str]`` for the :fixture:`capfd` and :fixture:`capsys` fixtures.
  - ``pytest.CaptureFixture[bytes]`` for the :fixture:`capfdbinary` and :fixture:`capsysbinary` fixtures.
  - ``pytest.LogCaptureFixture`` for the :fixture:`caplog` fixture.
  - ``pytest.Pytester`` for the :fixture:`pytester` fixture.
  - ``pytest.Testdir`` for the :fixture:`testdir` fixture.
  - ``pytest.TempdirFactory`` for the :fixture:`tmpdir_factory` fixture.
  - ``pytest.TempPathFactory`` for the :fixture:`tmp_path_factory` fixture.
  - ``pytest.MonkeyPatch`` for the :fixture:`monkeypatch` fixture.
  - ``pytest.WarningsRecorder`` for the :fixture:`recwarn` fixture.

  Constructing them is not supported (except for `MonkeyPatch`); they are only meant for use in type annotations.
  Doing so will emit a deprecation warning, and may become a hard-error in pytest 8.0.

  Subclassing them is also not supported. This is not currently enforced at runtime, but is detected by type-checkers such as mypy.


- :issue:`7527`: When a comparison between :func:`namedtuple <collections.namedtuple>` instances of the same type fails, pytest now shows the differing field names (possibly nested) instead of their indexes.


- :issue:`7615`: :meth:`Node.warn <_pytest.nodes.Node.warn>` now permits any subclass of :class:`Warning`, not just :class:`PytestWarning <pytest.PytestWarning>`.


- :issue:`7701`: Improved reporting when using ``--collected-only``. It will now show the number of collected tests in the summary stats.


- :issue:`7710`: Use strict equality comparison for non-numeric types in :func:`pytest.approx` instead of
  raising :class:`TypeError`.

  This was the undocumented behavior before 3.7, but is now officially a supported feature.


- :issue:`7938`: New ``--sw-skip`` argument which is a shorthand for ``--stepwise-skip``.


- :issue:`8023`: Added ``'node_modules'`` to default value for :confval:`norecursedirs`.


- :issue:`8032`: :meth:`doClassCleanups <unittest.TestCase.doClassCleanups>` (introduced in :mod:`unittest` in Python and 3.8) is now called appropriately.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`4824`: Fixed quadratic behavior and improved performance of collection of items using autouse fixtures and xunit fixtures.


- :issue:`7758`: Fixed an issue where some files in packages are getting lost from ``--lf`` even though they contain tests that failed. Regressed in pytest 5.4.0.


- :issue:`7911`: Directories created by by :fixture:`tmp_path` and :fixture:`tmpdir` are now considered stale after 3 days without modification (previous value was 3 hours) to avoid deleting directories still in use in long running test suites.


- :issue:`7913`: Fixed a crash or hang in :meth:`pytester.spawn <pytest.Pytester.spawn>` when the :mod:`readline` module is involved.


- :issue:`7951`: Fixed handling of recursive symlinks when collecting tests.


- :issue:`7981`: Fixed symlinked directories not being followed during collection. Regressed in pytest 6.1.0.


- :issue:`8016`: Fixed only one doctest being collected when using ``pytest --doctest-modules path/to/an/__init__.py``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`7429`: Add more information and use cases about skipping doctests.


- :issue:`7780`: Classes which should not be inherited from are now marked ``final class`` in the API reference.


- :issue:`7872`: ``_pytest.config.argparsing.Parser.addini()`` accepts explicit ``None`` and ``"string"``.


- :issue:`7878`: In pull request section, ask to commit after editing changelog and authors file.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`7802`: The ``attrs`` dependency requirement is now >=19.2.0 instead of >=17.4.0.


- :issue:`8014`: `.pyc` files created by pytest's assertion rewriting now conform to the newer :pep:`552` format on Python>=3.7.
  (These files are internal and only interpreted by pytest itself.)


pytest 6.1.2 (2020-10-28)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`7758`: Fixed an issue where some files in packages are getting lost from ``--lf`` even though they contain tests that failed. Regressed in pytest 5.4.0.


- :issue:`7911`: Directories created by `tmpdir` are now considered stale after 3 days without modification (previous value was 3 hours) to avoid deleting directories still in use in long running test suites.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`7815`: Improve deprecation warning message for ``pytest._fillfuncargs()``.


pytest 6.1.1 (2020-10-03)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`7807`: Fixed regression in pytest 6.1.0 causing incorrect rootdir to be determined in some non-trivial cases where parent directories have config files as well.


- :issue:`7814`: Fixed crash in header reporting when :confval:`testpaths` is used and contains absolute paths (regression in 6.1.0).


pytest 6.1.0 (2020-09-26)
=========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

- :issue:`5585`: As per our policy, the following features which have been deprecated in the 5.X series are now
  removed:

  * The ``funcargnames`` read-only property of ``FixtureRequest``, ``Metafunc``, and ``Function`` classes. Use ``fixturenames`` attribute.

  * ``@pytest.fixture`` no longer supports positional arguments, pass all arguments by keyword instead.

  * Direct construction of ``Node`` subclasses now raise an error, use ``from_parent`` instead.

  * The default value for ``junit_family`` has changed to ``xunit2``. If you require the old format, add ``junit_family=xunit1`` to your configuration file.

  * The ``TerminalReporter`` no longer has a ``writer`` attribute. Plugin authors may use the public functions of the ``TerminalReporter`` instead of accessing the ``TerminalWriter`` object directly.

  * The ``--result-log`` option has been removed. Users are recommended to use the `pytest-reportlog <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-reportlog>`__ plugin instead.


  For more information consult :std:doc:`deprecations` in the docs.



Deprecations
------------

- :issue:`6981`: The ``pytest.collect`` module is deprecated: all its names can be imported from ``pytest`` directly.


- :issue:`7097`: The ``pytest._fillfuncargs`` function is deprecated. This function was kept
  for backward compatibility with an older plugin.

  It's functionality is not meant to be used directly, but if you must replace
  it, use `function._request._fillfixtures()` instead, though note this is not
  a public API and may break in the future.


- :issue:`7210`: The special ``-k '-expr'`` syntax to ``-k`` is deprecated. Use ``-k 'not expr'``
  instead.

  The special ``-k 'expr:'`` syntax to ``-k`` is deprecated. Please open an issue
  if you use this and want a replacement.


- :issue:`7255`: The ``pytest_warning_captured`` hook is deprecated in favor
  of :hook:`pytest_warning_recorded`, and will be removed in a future version.


- :issue:`7648`: The ``gethookproxy()`` and ``isinitpath()`` methods of ``FSCollector`` and ``Package`` are deprecated;
  use ``self.session.gethookproxy()`` and ``self.session.isinitpath()`` instead.
  This should work on all pytest versions.



Features
--------

- :issue:`7667`: New ``--durations-min`` command-line flag controls the minimal duration for inclusion in the slowest list of tests shown by ``--durations``. Previously this was hard-coded to ``0.005s``.



Improvements
------------

- :issue:`6681`: Internal pytest warnings issued during the early stages of initialization are now properly handled and can filtered through :confval:`filterwarnings` or ``--pythonwarnings/-W``.

  This also fixes a number of long standing issues: :issue:`2891`, :issue:`7620`, :issue:`7426`.


- :issue:`7572`: When a plugin listed in ``required_plugins`` is missing or an unknown config key is used with ``--strict-config``, a simple error message is now shown instead of a stacktrace.


- :issue:`7685`: Added two new attributes :attr:`rootpath <pytest.Config.rootpath>` and :attr:`inipath <pytest.Config.inipath>` to :class:`~pytest.Config`.
  These attributes are :class:`pathlib.Path` versions of the existing ``rootdir`` and ``inifile`` attributes,
  and should be preferred over them when possible.


- :issue:`7780`: Public classes which are not designed to be inherited from are now marked :func:`@final <typing.final>`.
  Code which inherits from these classes will trigger a type-checking (e.g. mypy) error, but will still work in runtime.
  Currently the ``final`` designation does not appear in the API Reference but hopefully will in the future.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`1953`: Fixed error when overwriting a parametrized fixture, while also reusing the super fixture value.

  .. code-block:: python

      # conftest.py
      import pytest


      @pytest.fixture(params=[1, 2])
      def foo(request):
          return request.param


      # test_foo.py
      import pytest


      @pytest.fixture
      def foo(foo):
          return foo * 2


- :issue:`4984`: Fixed an internal error crash with ``IndexError: list index out of range`` when
  collecting a module which starts with a decorated function, the decorator
  raises, and assertion rewriting is enabled.


- :issue:`7591`: pylint shouldn't complain anymore about unimplemented abstract methods when inheriting from :ref:`File <non-python tests>`.


- :issue:`7628`: Fixed test collection when a full path without a drive letter was passed to pytest on Windows (for example ``\projects\tests\test.py`` instead of ``c:\projects\tests\pytest.py``).


- :issue:`7638`: Fix handling of command-line options that appear as paths but trigger an OS-level syntax error on Windows, such as the options used internally by ``pytest-xdist``.


- :issue:`7742`: Fixed INTERNALERROR when accessing locals / globals with faulty ``exec``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`1477`: Removed faq.rst and its reference in contents.rst.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`7536`: The internal ``junitxml`` plugin has rewritten to use ``xml.etree.ElementTree``.
  The order of attributes in XML elements might differ. Some unneeded escaping is
  no longer performed.


- :issue:`7587`: The dependency on the ``more-itertools`` package has been removed.


- :issue:`7631`: The result type of :meth:`capfd.readouterr() <pytest.CaptureFixture.readouterr>` (and similar) is no longer a namedtuple,
  but should behave like one in all respects. This was done for technical reasons.


- :issue:`7671`: When collecting tests, pytest finds test classes and functions by examining the
  attributes of python objects (modules, classes and instances). To speed up this
  process, pytest now ignores builtin attributes (like ``__class__``,
  ``__delattr__`` and ``__new__``) without consulting the :confval:`python_classes` and
  :confval:`python_functions` configuration options and without passing them to plugins
  using the :hook:`pytest_pycollect_makeitem` hook.


pytest 6.0.2 (2020-09-04)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`7148`: Fixed ``--log-cli`` potentially causing unrelated ``print`` output to be swallowed.


- :issue:`7672`: Fixed log-capturing level restored incorrectly if ``caplog.set_level`` is called more than once.


- :issue:`7686`: Fixed `NotSetType.token` being used as the parameter ID when the parametrization list is empty.
  Regressed in pytest 6.0.0.


- :issue:`7707`: Fix internal error when handling some exceptions that contain multiple lines or the style uses multiple lines (``--tb=line`` for example).


pytest 6.0.1 (2020-07-30)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`7394`: Passing an empty ``help`` value to ``Parser.add_option`` is now accepted instead of crashing when running ``pytest --help``.
  Passing ``None`` raises a more informative ``TypeError``.


- :issue:`7558`: Fix pylint ``not-callable`` lint on ``pytest.mark.parametrize()`` and the other builtin marks:
  ``skip``, ``skipif``, ``xfail``, ``usefixtures``, ``filterwarnings``.


- :issue:`7559`: Fix regression in plugins using ``TestReport.longreprtext`` (such as ``pytest-html``) when ``TestReport.longrepr`` is not a string.


- :issue:`7569`: Fix logging capture handler's level not reset on teardown after a call to ``caplog.set_level()``.


pytest 6.0.0 (2020-07-28)
=========================

(**Please see the full set of changes for this release also in the 6.0.0rc1 notes below**)

Breaking Changes
----------------

- :issue:`5584`: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 6.1**, so please consult the
  :std:doc:`deprecations` section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``6.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a
  stopgap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``6.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to :issue:`5584`.


- :issue:`7472`: The ``exec_()`` and ``is_true()`` methods of ``_pytest._code.Frame`` have been removed.



Features
--------

- :issue:`7464`: Added support for :envvar:`NO_COLOR` and :envvar:`FORCE_COLOR` environment variables to control colored output.



Improvements
------------

- :issue:`7467`: ``--log-file`` CLI option and ``log_file`` ini marker now create subdirectories if needed.


- :issue:`7489`: The :func:`pytest.raises` function has a clearer error message when ``match`` equals the obtained string but is not a regex match. In this case it is suggested to escape the regex.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`7392`: Fix the reported location of tests skipped with ``@pytest.mark.skip`` when ``--runxfail`` is used.


- :issue:`7491`: :fixture:`tmpdir` and :fixture:`tmp_path` no longer raise an error if the lock to check for
  stale temporary directories is not accessible.


- :issue:`7517`: Preserve line endings when captured via ``capfd``.


- :issue:`7534`: Restored the previous formatting of ``TracebackEntry.__str__`` which was changed by accident.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`7422`: Clarified when the ``usefixtures`` mark can apply fixtures to test.


- :issue:`7441`: Add a note about ``-q`` option used in getting started guide.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`7389`: Fixture scope ``package`` is no longer considered experimental.


pytest 6.0.0rc1 (2020-07-08)
============================

Breaking Changes
----------------

- :issue:`1316`: ``TestReport.longrepr`` is now always an instance of ``ReprExceptionInfo``. Previously it was a ``str`` when a test failed with ``pytest.fail(..., pytrace=False)``.


- :issue:`5965`: symlinks are no longer resolved during collection and matching `conftest.py` files with test file paths.

  Resolving symlinks for the current directory and during collection was introduced as a bugfix in 3.9.0, but it actually is a new feature which had unfortunate consequences in Windows and surprising results in other platforms.

  The team decided to step back on resolving symlinks at all, planning to review this in the future with a more solid solution (see discussion in
  :pr:`6523` for details).

  This might break test suites which made use of this feature; the fix is to create a symlink
  for the entire test tree, and not only to partial files/tress as it was possible previously.


- :issue:`6505`: ``Testdir.run().parseoutcomes()`` now always returns the parsed nouns in plural form.

  Originally ``parseoutcomes()`` would always returns the nouns in plural form, but a change
  meant to improve the terminal summary by using singular form single items (``1 warning`` or ``1 error``)
  caused an unintended regression by changing the keys returned by ``parseoutcomes()``.

  Now the API guarantees to always return the plural form, so calls like this:

  .. code-block:: python

      result = testdir.runpytest()
      result.assert_outcomes(error=1)

  Need to be changed to:


  .. code-block:: python

      result = testdir.runpytest()
      result.assert_outcomes(errors=1)


- :issue:`6903`: The ``os.dup()`` function is now assumed to exist. We are not aware of any
  supported Python 3 implementations which do not provide it.


- :issue:`7040`: ``-k`` no longer matches against the names of the directories outside the test session root.

  Also, ``pytest.Package.name`` is now just the name of the directory containing the package's
  ``__init__.py`` file, instead of the full path. This is consistent with how the other nodes
  are named, and also one of the reasons why ``-k`` would match against any directory containing
  the test suite.


- :issue:`7122`: Expressions given to the ``-m`` and ``-k`` options are no longer evaluated using Python's :func:`eval`.
  The format supports ``or``, ``and``, ``not``, parenthesis and general identifiers to match against.
  Python constants, keywords or other operators are no longer evaluated differently.


- :issue:`7135`: Pytest now uses its own ``TerminalWriter`` class instead of using the one from the ``py`` library.
  Plugins generally access this class through ``TerminalReporter.writer``, ``TerminalReporter.write()``
  (and similar methods), or ``_pytest.config.create_terminal_writer()``.

  The following breaking changes were made:

  - Output (``write()`` method and others) no longer flush implicitly; the flushing behavior
    of the underlying file is respected. To flush explicitly (for example, if you
    want output to be shown before an end-of-line is printed), use ``write(flush=True)`` or
    ``terminal_writer.flush()``.
  - Explicit Windows console support was removed, delegated to the colorama library.
  - Support for writing ``bytes`` was removed.
  - The ``reline`` method and ``chars_on_current_line`` property were removed.
  - The ``stringio`` and ``encoding`` arguments was removed.
  - Support for passing a callable instead of a file was removed.


- :issue:`7224`: The `item.catch_log_handler` and `item.catch_log_handlers` attributes, set by the
  logging plugin and never meant to be public, are no longer available.

  The deprecated ``--no-print-logs`` option and ``log_print`` ini option are removed. Use ``--show-capture`` instead.


- :issue:`7226`: Removed the unused ``args`` parameter from ``pytest.Function.__init__``.


- :issue:`7418`: Removed the `pytest_doctest_prepare_content` hook specification. This hook
  hasn't been triggered by pytest for at least 10 years.


- :issue:`7438`: Some changes were made to the internal ``_pytest._code.source``, listed here
  for the benefit of plugin authors who may be using it:

  - The ``deindent`` argument to ``Source()`` has been removed, now it is always true.
  - Support for zero or multiple arguments to ``Source()`` has been removed.
  - Support for comparing ``Source`` with an ``str`` has been removed.
  - The methods ``Source.isparseable()`` and ``Source.putaround()`` have been removed.
  - The method ``Source.compile()`` and function ``_pytest._code.compile()`` have
    been removed; use plain ``compile()`` instead.
  - The function ``_pytest._code.source.getsource()`` has been removed; use
    ``Source()`` directly instead.



Deprecations
------------

- :issue:`7210`: The special ``-k '-expr'`` syntax to ``-k`` is deprecated. Use ``-k 'not expr'``
  instead.

  The special ``-k 'expr:'`` syntax to ``-k`` is deprecated. Please open an issue
  if you use this and want a replacement.

- :issue:`4049`: ``pytest_warning_captured`` is deprecated in favor of the ``pytest_warning_recorded`` hook.


Features
--------

- :issue:`1556`: pytest now supports ``pyproject.toml`` files for configuration.

  The configuration options is similar to the one available in other formats, but must be defined
  in a ``[tool.pytest.ini_options]`` table to be picked up by pytest:

  .. code-block:: toml

      # pyproject.toml
      [tool.pytest.ini_options]
      minversion = "6.0"
      addopts = "-ra -q"
      testpaths = [
          "tests",
          "integration",
      ]

  More information can be found :ref:`in the docs <config file formats>`.


- :issue:`3342`: pytest now includes inline type annotations and exposes them to user programs.
  Most of the user-facing API is covered, as well as internal code.

  If you are running a type checker such as mypy on your tests, you may start
  noticing type errors indicating incorrect usage. If you run into an error that
  you believe to be incorrect, please let us know in an issue.

  The types were developed against mypy version 0.780. Versions before 0.750
  are known not to work. We recommend using the latest version. Other type
  checkers may work as well, but they are not officially verified to work by
  pytest yet.


- :issue:`4049`: Introduced a new hook named `pytest_warning_recorded` to convey information about warnings captured by the internal `pytest` warnings plugin.

  This hook is meant to replace `pytest_warning_captured`, which is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.


- :issue:`6471`: New command-line flags:

  * `--no-header`: disables the initial header, including platform, version, and plugins.
  * `--no-summary`: disables the final test summary, including warnings.


- :issue:`6856`: A warning is now shown when an unknown key is read from a config INI file.

  The `--strict-config` flag has been added to treat these warnings as errors.


- :issue:`6906`: Added `--code-highlight` command line option to enable/disable code highlighting in terminal output.


- :issue:`7245`: New ``--import-mode=importlib`` option that uses :mod:`importlib` to import test modules.

  Traditionally pytest used ``__import__`` while changing ``sys.path`` to import test modules (which
  also changes ``sys.modules`` as a side-effect), which works but has a number of drawbacks, like requiring test modules
  that don't live in packages to have unique names (as they need to reside under a unique name in ``sys.modules``).

  ``--import-mode=importlib`` uses more fine-grained import mechanisms from ``importlib`` which don't
  require pytest to change ``sys.path`` or ``sys.modules`` at all, eliminating much of the drawbacks
  of the previous mode.

  We intend to make ``--import-mode=importlib`` the default in future versions, so users are encouraged
  to try the new mode and provide feedback (both positive or negative) in issue :issue:`7245`.

  You can read more about this option in :std:ref:`the documentation <import-modes>`.


- :issue:`7305`: New ``required_plugins`` configuration option allows the user to specify a list of plugins, including version information, that are required for pytest to run. An error is raised if any required plugins are not found when running pytest.


Improvements
------------

- :issue:`4375`: The ``pytest`` command now suppresses the ``BrokenPipeError`` error message that
  is printed to stderr when the output of ``pytest`` is piped and the pipe is
  closed by the piped-to program (common examples are ``less`` and ``head``).


- :issue:`4391`: Improved precision of test durations measurement. ``CallInfo`` items now have a new ``<CallInfo>.duration`` attribute, created using ``time.perf_counter()``. This attribute is used to fill the ``<TestReport>.duration`` attribute, which is more accurate than the previous ``<CallInfo>.stop - <CallInfo>.start`` (as these are based on ``time.time()``).


- :issue:`4675`: Rich comparison for dataclasses and `attrs`-classes is now recursive.


- :issue:`6285`: Exposed the `pytest.FixtureLookupError` exception which is raised by `request.getfixturevalue()`
  (where `request` is a `FixtureRequest` fixture) when a fixture with the given name cannot be returned.


- :issue:`6433`: If an error is encountered while formatting the message in a logging call, for
  example ``logging.warning("oh no!: %s: %s", "first")`` (a second argument is
  missing), pytest now propagates the error, likely causing the test to fail.

  Previously, such a mistake would cause an error to be printed to stderr, which
  is not displayed by default for passing tests. This change makes the mistake
  visible during testing.

  You may suppress this behavior temporarily or permanently by setting
  ``logging.raiseExceptions = False``.


- :issue:`6817`: Explicit new-lines in help texts of command-line options are preserved, allowing plugins better control
  of the help displayed to users.


- :issue:`6940`: When using the ``--duration`` option, the terminal message output is now more precise about the number and duration of hidden items.


- :issue:`6991`: Collected files are displayed after any reports from hooks, e.g. the status from ``--lf``.


- :issue:`7091`: When ``fd`` capturing is used, through ``--capture=fd`` or the ``capfd`` and
  ``capfdbinary`` fixtures, and the file descriptor (0, 1, 2) cannot be
  duplicated, FD capturing is still performed. Previously, direct writes to the
  file descriptors would fail or be lost in this case.


- :issue:`7119`: Exit with an error if the ``--basetemp`` argument is empty, is the current working directory or is one of the parent directories.
  This is done to protect against accidental data loss, as any directory passed to this argument is cleared.


- :issue:`7128`: `pytest --version` now displays just the pytest version, while `pytest --version --version` displays more verbose information including plugins. This is more consistent with how other tools show `--version`.


- :issue:`7133`: :meth:`caplog.set_level() <pytest.LogCaptureFixture.set_level>` will now override any :confval:`log_level` set via the CLI or configuration file.


- :issue:`7159`: :meth:`caplog.set_level() <pytest.LogCaptureFixture.set_level>` and :meth:`caplog.at_level() <pytest.LogCaptureFixture.at_level>` no longer affect
  the level of logs that are shown in the *Captured log report* report section.


- :issue:`7348`: Improve recursive diff report for comparison asserts on dataclasses / attrs.


- :issue:`7385`: ``--junitxml`` now includes the exception cause in the ``message`` XML attribute for failures during setup and teardown.

  Previously:

  .. code-block:: xml

      <error message="test setup failure">

  Now:

  .. code-block:: xml

      <error message="failed on setup with &quot;ValueError: Some error during setup&quot;">

- :issue:`6991`: Fix regressions with `--lf` filtering too much since pytest 5.4.


- :issue:`6992`: Revert "tmpdir: clean up indirection via config for factories" :issue:`6767` as it breaks pytest-xdist.


- :issue:`7061`: When a yielding fixture fails to yield a value, report a test setup error instead of crashing.


- :issue:`7076`: The path of file skipped by ``@pytest.mark.skip`` in the SKIPPED report is now relative to invocation directory. Previously it was relative to root directory.


- :issue:`7110`: Fixed regression: ``asyncbase.TestCase`` tests are executed correctly again.


- :issue:`7126`: ``--setup-show`` now doesn't raise an error when a bytes value is used as a ``parametrize``
  parameter when Python is called with the ``-bb`` flag.


- :issue:`7143`: Fix :meth:`pytest.File.from_parent <_pytest.nodes.Node.from_parent>` so it forwards extra keyword arguments to the constructor.


- :issue:`7145`: Classes with broken ``__getattribute__`` methods are displayed correctly during failures.


- :issue:`7150`: Prevent hiding the underlying exception when ``ConfTestImportFailure`` is raised.


- :issue:`7180`: Fix ``_is_setup_py`` for files encoded differently than locale.


- :issue:`7215`: Fix regression where running with ``--pdb`` would call :meth:`unittest.TestCase.tearDown` for skipped tests.


- :issue:`7253`: When using ``pytest.fixture`` on a function directly, as in ``pytest.fixture(func)``,
  if the ``autouse`` or ``params`` arguments are also passed, the function is no longer
  ignored, but is marked as a fixture.


- :issue:`7360`: Fix possibly incorrect evaluation of string expressions passed to ``pytest.mark.skipif`` and ``pytest.mark.xfail``,
  in rare circumstances where the exact same string is used but refers to different global values.


- :issue:`7383`: Fixed exception causes all over the codebase, i.e. use `raise new_exception from old_exception` when wrapping an exception.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`7202`: The development guide now links to the contributing section of the docs and `RELEASING.rst` on GitHub.


- :issue:`7233`: Add a note about ``--strict`` and ``--strict-markers`` and the preference for the latter one.


- :issue:`7345`: Explain indirect parametrization and markers for fixtures.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`7035`: The ``originalname`` attribute of ``_pytest.python.Function`` now defaults to ``name`` if not
  provided explicitly, and is always set.


- :issue:`7264`: The dependency on the ``wcwidth`` package has been removed.


- :issue:`7291`: Replaced ``py.iniconfig`` with :pypi:`iniconfig`.


- :issue:`7295`: ``src/_pytest/config/__init__.py`` now uses the ``warnings`` module to report warnings instead of ``sys.stderr.write``.


- :issue:`7356`: Remove last internal uses of deprecated *slave* term from old ``pytest-xdist``.


- :issue:`7357`: ``py``>=1.8.2 is now required.


pytest 5.4.3 (2020-06-02)

---------

- :issue:`6871`: Fix crash with captured output when using the :fixture:`capsysbinary fixture <capsysbinary>`.


- :issue:`6924`: Ensure a ``unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase`` is actually awaited.


- :issue:`6925`: Fix TerminalRepr instances to be hashable again.

pytest 5.4.1 (2020-03-13)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`6909`: Revert the change introduced by :pr:`6330`, which required all arguments to ``@pytest.mark.parametrize`` to be explicitly defined in the function signature.

  The intention of the original change was to remove what was expected to be an unintended/surprising behavior, but it turns out many people relied on it, so the restriction has been reverted.


- :issue:`6910`: Fix crash when plugins return an unknown stats while using the ``--reportlog`` option.


pytest 5.4.0 (2020-03-12)
=========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

- :issue:`6316`: Matching of ``-k EXPRESSION`` to test names is now case-insensitive.


- :issue:`6443`: Plugins specified with ``-p`` are now loaded after internal plugins, which results in their hooks being called *before* the internal ones.

  This makes the ``-p`` behavior consistent with ``PYTEST_PLUGINS``.


- :issue:`6637`: Removed the long-deprecated ``pytest_itemstart`` hook.

  This hook has been marked as deprecated and not been even called by pytest for over 10 years now.


- :issue:`6673`: Reversed / fix meaning of "+/-" in error diffs.  "-" means that something expected is missing in the result and "+" means that there are unexpected extras in the result.


- :issue:`6737`: The ``cached_result`` attribute of ``FixtureDef`` is now set to ``None`` when
  the result is unavailable, instead of being deleted.

  If your plugin performs checks like ``hasattr(fixturedef, 'cached_result')``,
  for example in a ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hook implementation, replace
  it with ``fixturedef.cached_result is not None``. If you ``del`` the attribute,
  set it to ``None`` instead.



Deprecations
------------

- :issue:`3238`: Option ``--no-print-logs`` is deprecated and meant to be removed in a future release. If you use ``--no-print-logs``, please try out ``--show-capture`` and
  provide feedback.

  ``--show-capture`` command-line option was added in ``pytest 3.5.0`` and allows to specify how to
  display captured output when tests fail: ``no``, ``stdout``, ``stderr``, ``log`` or ``all`` (the default).


- :issue:`571`: Deprecate the unused/broken `pytest_collect_directory` hook.
  It was misaligned since the removal of the ``Directory`` collector in 2010
  and incorrect/unusable as soon as collection was split from test execution.


- :issue:`5975`: Deprecate using direct constructors for ``Nodes``.

  Instead they are now constructed via ``Node.from_parent``.

  This transitional mechanism enables us to untangle the very intensely
  entangled ``Node`` relationships by enforcing more controlled creation/configuration patterns.

  As part of this change, session/config are already disallowed parameters and as we work on the details we might need disallow a few more as well.

  Subclasses are expected to use `super().from_parent` if they intend to expand the creation of `Nodes`.


- :issue:`6779`: The ``TerminalReporter.writer`` attribute has been deprecated and should no longer be used. This
  was inadvertently exposed as part of the public API of that plugin and ties it too much
  with ``py.io.TerminalWriter``.



Features
--------

- :issue:`4597`: New :ref:`--capture=tee-sys <capture-method>` option to allow both live printing and capturing of test output.


- :issue:`5712`: Now all arguments to ``@pytest.mark.parametrize`` need to be explicitly declared in the function signature or via ``indirect``.
  Previously it was possible to omit an argument if a fixture with the same name existed, which was just an accident of implementation and was not meant to be a part of the API.


- :issue:`6454`: Changed default for `-r` to `fE`, which displays failures and errors in the :ref:`short test summary <pytest.detailed_failed_tests_usage>`.  `-rN` can be used to disable it (the old behavior).


- :issue:`6469`: New options have been added to the :confval:`junit_logging` option: ``log``, ``out-err``, and ``all``.


- :issue:`6834`: Excess warning summaries are now collapsed per file to ensure readable display of warning summaries.



Improvements
------------

- :issue:`1857`: ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` accepts integers for ``ids`` again, converting it to strings.


- :issue:`449`: Use "yellow" main color with any XPASSED tests.


- :issue:`4639`: Revert "A warning is now issued when assertions are made for ``None``".

  The warning proved to be less useful than initially expected and had quite a
  few false positive cases.


- :issue:`5686`: ``tmpdir_factory.mktemp`` now fails when given absolute and non-normalized paths.


- :issue:`5984`: The ``pytest_warning_captured`` hook now receives a ``location`` parameter with the code location that generated the warning.


- :issue:`6213`: pytester: the ``testdir`` fixture respects environment settings from the ``monkeypatch`` fixture for inner runs.


- :issue:`6247`: ``--fulltrace`` is honored with collection errors.


- :issue:`6384`: Make `--showlocals` work also with `--tb=short`.


- :issue:`6653`: Add support for matching lines consecutively with :class:`~pytest.LineMatcher`'s :func:`~pytest.LineMatcher.fnmatch_lines` and :func:`~pytest.LineMatcher.re_match_lines`.


- :issue:`6658`: Code is now highlighted in tracebacks when ``pygments`` is installed.

  Users are encouraged to install ``pygments`` into their environment and provide feedback, because
  the plan is to make ``pygments`` a regular dependency in the future.


- :issue:`6795`: Import usage error message with invalid `-o` option.


- :issue:`759`: ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` supports iterators and generators for ``ids``.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`310`: Add support for calling `pytest.xfail()` and `pytest.importorskip()` with doctests.


- :issue:`3823`: ``--trace`` now works with unittests.


- :issue:`4445`: Fixed some warning reports produced by pytest to point to the correct location of the warning in the user's code.


- :issue:`5301`: Fix ``--last-failed`` to collect new tests from files with known failures.


- :issue:`5928`: Report ``PytestUnknownMarkWarning`` at the level of the user's code, not ``pytest``'s.


- :issue:`5991`: Fix interaction with ``--pdb`` and unittests: do not use unittest's ``TestCase.debug()``.


- :issue:`6334`: Fix summary entries appearing twice when ``f/F`` and ``s/S`` report chars were used at the same time in the ``-r`` command-line option (for example ``-rFf``).

  The upper case variants were never documented and the preferred form should be the lower case.


- :issue:`6409`: Fallback to green (instead of yellow) for non-last items without previous passes with colored terminal progress indicator.


- :issue:`6454`: `--disable-warnings` is honored with `-ra` and `-rA`.


- :issue:`6497`: Fix bug in the comparison of request key with cached key in fixture.

  A construct ``if key == cached_key:`` can fail either because ``==`` is explicitly disallowed, or for, e.g., NumPy arrays, where the result of ``a == b`` cannot generally be converted to :class:`bool`.
  The implemented fix replaces `==` with ``is``.


- :issue:`6557`: Make capture output streams ``.write()`` method return the same return value from original streams.


- :issue:`6566`: Fix ``EncodedFile.writelines`` to call the underlying buffer's ``writelines`` method.


- :issue:`6575`: Fix internal crash when ``faulthandler`` starts initialized
  (for example with ``PYTHONFAULTHANDLER=1`` environment variable set) and ``faulthandler_timeout`` defined
  in the configuration file.


- :issue:`6597`: Fix node ids which contain a parametrized empty-string variable.


- :issue:`6646`: Assertion rewriting hooks are (re)stored for the current item, which fixes them being still used after e.g. pytester's ``testdir.runpytest`` etc.


- :issue:`6660`: :py:func:`pytest.exit` is handled when emitted from the :hook:`pytest_sessionfinish` hook.  This includes quitting from a debugger.


- :issue:`6752`: When :py:func:`pytest.raises` is used as a function (as opposed to a context manager),
  a `match` keyword argument is now passed through to the tested function. Previously
  it was swallowed and ignored (regression in pytest 5.1.0).


- :issue:`6801`: Do not display empty lines in between traceback for unexpected exceptions with doctests.


- :issue:`6802`: The :fixture:`testdir fixture <testdir>` works within doctests now.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`6696`: Add list of fixtures to start of fixture chapter.


- :issue:`6742`: Expand first sentence on fixtures into a paragraph.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`6404`: Remove usage of ``parser`` module, deprecated in Python 3.9.


pytest 5.3.5 (2020-01-29)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`6517`: Fix regression in pytest 5.3.4 causing an INTERNALERROR due to a wrong assertion.


pytest 5.3.4 (2020-01-20)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`6496`: Revert :issue:`6436`: unfortunately this change has caused a number of regressions in many suites,
  so the team decided to revert this change and make a new release while we continue to look for a solution.


pytest 5.3.3 (2020-01-16)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`2780`: Captured output during teardown is shown with ``-rP``.


- :issue:`5971`: Fix a ``pytest-xdist`` crash when dealing with exceptions raised in subprocesses created by the
  ``multiprocessing`` module.


- :issue:`6436`: :class:`~pytest.FixtureDef` objects now properly register their finalizers with autouse and
  parameterized fixtures that execute before them in the fixture stack so they are torn
  down at the right times, and in the right order.


- :issue:`6532`: Fix parsing of outcomes containing multiple errors with ``testdir`` results (regression in 5.3.0).



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`6350`: Optimized automatic renaming of test parameter IDs.


pytest 5.3.2 (2019-12-13)
=========================

Improvements
------------

- :issue:`4639`: Revert "A warning is now issued when assertions are made for ``None``".

  The warning proved to be less useful than initially expected and had quite a
  few false positive cases.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`5430`: junitxml: Logs for failed test are now passed to junit report in case the test fails during call phase.


- :issue:`6290`: The supporting files in the ``.pytest_cache`` directory are kept with ``--cache-clear``, which only clears cached values now.


- :issue:`6301`: Fix assertion rewriting for egg-based distributions and ``editable`` installs (``pip install --editable``).


pytest 5.3.1 (2019-11-25)
=========================

Improvements
------------

- :issue:`6231`: Improve check for misspelling of :ref:`pytest.mark.parametrize ref`.


- :issue:`6257`: Handle :func:`pytest.exit` being used via :hook:`pytest_internalerror`, e.g. when quitting pdb from post mortem.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`5914`: pytester: fix :py:func:`~pytest.LineMatcher.no_fnmatch_line` when used after positive matching.


- :issue:`6082`: Fix line detection for doctest samples inside
  :py:class:`python:property` docstrings, as a workaround to
  :issue:`python/cpython#61648`.


- :issue:`6254`: Fix compatibility with pytest-parallel (regression in pytest 5.3.0).


- :issue:`6255`: Clear the :py:data:`sys.last_traceback`, :py:data:`sys.last_type`
  and :py:data:`sys.last_value` attributes by deleting them instead
  of setting them to ``None``. This better matches the behaviour of
  the Python standard library.


pytest 5.3.0 (2019-11-19)
=========================

Deprecations
------------

- :issue:`6179`: The default value of :confval:`junit_family` option will change to ``"xunit2"`` in pytest 6.0, given
  that this is the version supported by default in modern tools that manipulate this type of file.

  In order to smooth the transition, pytest will issue a warning in case the ``--junitxml`` option
  is given in the command line but :confval:`junit_family` is not explicitly configured in ``pytest.ini``.

  For more information, :ref:`see the docs <junit-family changed default value>`.



Features
--------

- :issue:`4488`: The pytest team has created the `pytest-reportlog <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-reportlog>`__
  plugin, which provides a new ``--report-log=FILE`` option that writes *report logs* into a file as the test session executes.

  Each line of the report log contains a self contained JSON object corresponding to a testing event,
  such as a collection or a test result report. The file is guaranteed to be flushed after writing
  each line, so systems can read and process events in real-time.

  The plugin is meant to replace the ``--resultlog`` option, which is deprecated and meant to be removed
  in a future release. If you use ``--resultlog``, please try out ``pytest-reportlog`` and
  provide feedback.


- :issue:`4730`: When :py:data:`sys.pycache_prefix` (Python 3.8+) is set, it will be used by pytest to cache test files changed by the assertion rewriting mechanism.

  This makes it easier to benefit of cached ``.pyc`` files even on file systems without permissions.


- :issue:`5515`: Allow selective auto-indentation of multiline log messages.

  Adds command line option ``--log-auto-indent``, config option
  :confval:`log_auto_indent` and support for per-entry configuration of
  indentation behavior on calls to :py:func:`python:logging.log()`.

  Alters the default for auto-indention from ``"on"`` to ``"off"``. This
  restores the older behavior that existed prior to v4.6.0. This
  reversion to earlier behavior was done because it is better to
  activate new features that may lead to broken tests explicitly
  rather than implicitly.


- :issue:`5914`: :fixture:`testdir` learned two new functions, :py:func:`~pytest.LineMatcher.no_fnmatch_line` and
  :py:func:`~pytest.LineMatcher.no_re_match_line`.

  The functions are used to ensure the captured text *does not* match the given
  pattern.

  The previous idiom was to use :py:func:`python:re.match`:

  .. code-block:: python

      result = testdir.runpytest()
      assert re.match(pat, result.stdout.str()) is None

  Or the ``in`` operator:

  .. code-block:: python

      result = testdir.runpytest()
      assert text in result.stdout.str()

  But the new functions produce best output on failure.


- :issue:`6057`: Added tolerances to complex values when printing ``pytest.approx``.

  For example, ``repr(pytest.approx(3+4j))`` returns ``(3+4j) ± 5e-06 ∠ ±180°``. This is polar notation indicating a circle around the expected value, with a radius of 5e-06. For ``approx`` comparisons to return ``True``, the actual value should fall within this circle.


- :issue:`6061`: Added the pluginmanager as an argument to ``pytest_addoption``
  so that hooks can be invoked when setting up command line options. This is
  useful for having one plugin communicate things to another plugin,
  such as default values or which set of command line options to add.



Improvements
------------

- :issue:`5061`: Use multiple colors with terminal summary statistics.


- :issue:`5630`: Quitting from debuggers is now properly handled in ``doctest`` items.


- :issue:`5924`: Improved verbose diff output with sequences.

  Before:

  ::

      E   AssertionError: assert ['version', '...version_info'] == ['version', '...version', ...]
      E     Right contains 3 more items, first extra item: ' '
      E     Full diff:
      E     - ['version', 'version_info', 'sys.version', 'sys.version_info']
      E     + ['version',
      E     +  'version_info',
      E     +  'sys.version',
      E     +  'sys.version_info',
      E     +  ' ',
      E     +  'sys.version',
      E     +  'sys.version_info']

  After:

  ::

      E   AssertionError: assert ['version', '...version_info'] == ['version', '...version', ...]
      E     Right contains 3 more items, first extra item: ' '
      E     Full diff:
      E       [
      E        'version',
      E        'version_info',
      E        'sys.version',
      E        'sys.version_info',
      E     +  ' ',
      E     +  'sys.version',
      E     +  'sys.version_info',
      E       ]


- :issue:`5934`: ``repr`` of ``ExceptionInfo`` objects has been improved to honor the ``__repr__`` method of the underlying exception.

- :issue:`5936`: Display untruncated assertion message with ``-vv``.


- :issue:`5990`: Fixed plurality mismatch in test summary (e.g. display "1 error" instead of "1 errors").


- :issue:`6008`: ``Config.InvocationParams.args`` is now always a ``tuple`` to better convey that it should be
  immutable and avoid accidental modifications.


- :issue:`6023`: ``pytest.main`` returns a ``pytest.ExitCode`` instance now, except for when custom exit codes are used (where it returns ``int`` then still).


- :issue:`6026`: Align prefixes in output of pytester's ``LineMatcher``.


- :issue:`6059`: Collection errors are reported as errors (and not failures like before) in the terminal's short test summary.


- :issue:`6069`: ``pytester.spawn`` does not skip/xfail tests on FreeBSD anymore unconditionally.


- :issue:`6097`: The "[...%]" indicator in the test summary is now colored according to the final (new) multi-colored line's main color.


- :issue:`6116`: Added ``--co`` as a synonym to ``--collect-only``.


- :issue:`6148`: ``atomicwrites`` is now only used on Windows, fixing a performance regression with assertion rewriting on Unix.


- :issue:`6152`: Now parametrization will use the ``__name__`` attribute of any object for the id, if present. Previously it would only use ``__name__`` for functions and classes.


- :issue:`6176`: Improved failure reporting with pytester's ``Hookrecorder.assertoutcome``.


- :issue:`6181`: The reason for a stopped session, e.g. with ``--maxfail`` / ``-x``, now gets reported in the test summary.


- :issue:`6206`: Improved ``cache.set`` robustness and performance.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`2049`: Fixed ``--setup-plan`` showing inaccurate information about fixture lifetimes.


- :issue:`2548`: Fixed line offset mismatch of skipped tests in terminal summary.


- :issue:`6039`: The ``PytestDoctestRunner`` is now properly invalidated when unconfiguring the doctest plugin.

  This is important when used with ``pytester``'s ``runpytest_inprocess``.


- :issue:`6047`: BaseExceptions are now handled in ``saferepr``, which includes ``pytest.fail.Exception`` etc.


- :issue:`6074`: pytester: fixed order of arguments in ``rm_rf`` warning when cleaning up temporary directories, and do not emit warnings for errors with ``os.open``.


- :issue:`6189`: Fixed result of ``getmodpath`` method.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`4901`: ``RunResult`` from ``pytester`` now displays the mnemonic of the ``ret`` attribute when it is a
  valid ``pytest.ExitCode`` value.


pytest 5.2.4 (2019-11-15)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`5902`: Fix warnings about deprecated ``cmp`` attribute in ``attrs>=19.2``.


pytest 5.2.0 (2019-09-28)
=========================

Deprecations
------------

- :issue:`1682`: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them
  as a keyword argument instead.



Features
--------

- :issue:`1682`: The ``scope`` parameter of ``@pytest.fixture`` can now be a callable that receives
  the fixture name and the ``config`` object as keyword-only parameters.
  See :ref:`the docs <dynamic scope>` for more information.


- :issue:`5764`: New behavior of the ``--pastebin`` option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`5806`: Fix "lexer" being used when uploading to bpaste.net from ``--pastebin`` to "text".


- :issue:`5884`: Fix ``--setup-only`` and ``--setup-show`` for custom pytest items.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`5056`: The HelpFormatter uses ``py.io.get_terminal_width`` for better width detection.


pytest 5.1.3 (2019-09-18)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`5807`: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.


- :issue:`5811`: Handle ``--fulltrace`` correctly with ``pytest.raises``.


- :issue:`5819`: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase
  characters (introduced by #5792).


pytest 5.1.2 (2019-08-30)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`2270`: Fixed ``self`` reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously ``self``
  would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.


- :issue:`570`: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during
  parametrization.


- :issue:`5782`: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from ``--pastebin``.


- :issue:`5786`: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like
  ``pytest-xdist`` to display them properly.


- :issue:`5792`: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading
  ``conftest.py`` from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored
  in the filesystem (e.g., ``c:\test`` instead of ``C:\test``).


pytest 5.1.1 (2019-08-20)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`5751`: Fixed ``TypeError`` when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.


pytest 5.1.0 (2019-08-15)
=========================

Removals
--------

- :issue:`5180`: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
  removed:

  * ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

  * ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

  * ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

  * ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
    syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
    ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

  * ``pytest.config`` global variable.

  * ``tmpdir_factory.ensuretemp`` method.

  * ``pytest_logwarning`` hook.

  * ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning type.

  * ``request`` is now a reserved name for fixtures.


  For more information consult :std:doc:`deprecations` in the docs.


- :issue:`5565`: Removed unused support code for :pypi:`unittest2`.

  The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
  necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn't seem
  to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

  Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
  for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
  at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
  remove it in this release.

  If you experience a regression because of this, please :issue:`file an issue <new>`.


- :issue:`5615`: ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.xfail`` and ``pytest.skip`` no longer support bytes for the message argument.

  This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use ``"message"``
  instead of ``u"message"``.

  Python 3 code is unlikely to pass ``bytes`` to these functions. If you do,
  please decode it to an ``str`` beforehand.



Features
--------

- :issue:`5564`: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.


- :issue:`5576`: New :ref:`NUMBER <using doctest options>`
  option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.
  Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault's `numtest <https://github.com/boisgera/numtest>`__
  extension for doctest.



Improvements
------------

- :issue:`5471`: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.


- :issue:`5707`: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over
  60 seconds, for example::

      ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`4344`: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with "__init__.py" only.


- :issue:`5115`: Warnings issued during ``pytest_configure`` are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.


- :issue:`5477`: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``<testsuites>`` root element.


- :issue:`5524`: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- :issue:`5537`: Replace ``importlib_metadata`` backport with ``importlib.metadata`` from the
  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- :issue:`5578`: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail``, ``pytest.skip``, etc)
  so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example ``@pytest.xfail``
  instead of ``@pytest.mark.xfail``).


- :issue:`5606`: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared
  for truth values against others, like ``numpy`` arrays.


- :issue:`5634`: ``pytest.exit`` is now correctly handled in ``unittest`` cases.
  This makes ``unittest`` cases handle ``quit`` from pytest's pdb correctly.


- :issue:`5650`: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.


- :issue:`5701`: Fix collection of ``staticmethod`` objects defined with ``functools.partial``.


- :issue:`5734`: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to ``async def`` functions.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`5669`: Add docstring for ``Testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`5095`: XML files of the ``xunit2`` family are now validated against the schema by pytest's own test suite
  to avoid future regressions.


- :issue:`5516`: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.


- :issue:`5603`: Simplified internal ``SafeRepr`` class and removed some dead code.


- :issue:`5664`: When invoking pytest's own testsuite with ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1``,
  the ``test_xfail_handling`` test no longer fails.


- :issue:`5684`: Replace manual handling of ``OSError.errno`` in the codebase by new ``OSError`` subclasses (``PermissionError``, ``FileNotFoundError``, etc.).


pytest 5.0.1 (2019-07-04)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`5479`: Improve quoting in ``raises`` match failure message.


- :issue:`5523`: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.


- :issue:`5547`: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`5517`: Improve "Declaring new hooks" section in chapter "Writing Plugins"


pytest 5.0.0 (2019-06-28)
=========================

Important
---------

This release is a Python3.5+ only release.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan
<https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/py27-py34-deprecation.html>`_.

Removals
--------

- :issue:`1149`: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
  typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
  This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
  but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
  See for example issues :issue:`1149`,
  :issue:`3413`, and
  :issue:`4009`.


- :issue:`5402`: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the
  :std:doc:`deprecations` section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``5.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``5.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to :issue:`5402`.


- :issue:`5412`: ``ExceptionInfo`` objects (returned by ``pytest.raises``) now have the same ``str`` representation as ``repr``, which
  avoids some confusion when users use ``print(e)`` to inspect the object.

  This means code like:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert "some message" in str(e)


  Needs to be changed to:

  .. code-block:: python

        with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
            ...
        assert "some message" in str(e.value)




Deprecations
------------

- :issue:`4488`: The removal of the ``--result-log`` option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as
  the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.


- :issue:`466`: The ``funcargnames`` attribute has been an alias for ``fixturenames`` since
  pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.



Features
--------

- :issue:`3457`: New :hook:`pytest_assertion_pass`
  hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.

  This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.


- :issue:`5440`: The :mod:`faulthandler` standard library
  module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

  This functionality was provided by integrating the external
  `pytest-faulthandler <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler>`__ plugin into the core,
  so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

  For more information see the docs: :ref:`faulthandler`.


- :issue:`5452`: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from ``pytest.`` instead of the internal ``_pytest.warning_types.`` module.


- :issue:`5125`: ``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

  The team doesn't expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

  **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`1403`: Switch from ``imp`` to ``importlib``.


- :issue:`1671`: The name of the ``.pyc`` files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version
  to avoid stale caches.


- :issue:`2761`: Honor :pep:`235` on case-insensitive file systems.


- :issue:`5078`: Test module is no longer double-imported when using ``--pyargs``.


- :issue:`5260`: Improved comparison of byte strings.

  When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::

          def test():
      >       assert b'spam' == b'eggs'
      E       AssertionError: assert b'spam' == b'eggs'
      E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101
      E         Use -v to get the full diff

  It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::

          def test():
      >       assert b'spam' == b'eggs'
      E       AssertionError: assert b'spam' == b'eggs'
      E         At index 0 diff: b's' != b'e'
      E         Use -v to get the full diff


- :issue:`5335`: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using
  '%(levelname).Xs' (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.


- :issue:`5354`: Fix ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` when the argvalues is an iterator.


- :issue:`5370`: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix ``NameError`` on nested comprehensions.


- :issue:`5371`: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect handling of generators with ``if``.


- :issue:`5372`: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix incorrect assertion when using ``all()`` in an expression.


- :issue:`5383`: ``-q`` has again an impact on the style of the collected items
  (``--collect-only``) when ``--log-cli-level`` is used.


- :issue:`5389`: Fix regressions of :pr:`5063` for ``importlib_metadata.PathDistribution`` which have their ``files`` attribute being ``None``.


- :issue:`5390`: Fix regression where the ``obj`` attribute of ``TestCase`` items was no longer bound to methods.


- :issue:`5404`: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (:issue:`5080`).


- :issue:`5432`: Prevent "already imported" warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.


- :issue:`5433`: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``__init__.py``).


- :issue:`5444`: Fix ``--stepwise`` mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.


- :issue:`5482`: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing
  more than 2 positional arguments to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


- :issue:`5505`: Fix crash when discovery fails while using ``-p no:terminal``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`5315`: Expand docs on mocking classes and dictionaries with ``monkeypatch``.


- :issue:`5416`: Fix PytestUnknownMarkWarning in run/skip example.


pytest 4.6.11 (2020-06-04)
==========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`6334`: Fix summary entries appearing twice when ``f/F`` and ``s/S`` report chars were used at the same time in the ``-r`` command-line option (for example ``-rFf``).

  The upper case variants were never documented and the preferred form should be the lower case.


- :issue:`7310`: Fix ``UnboundLocalError: local variable 'letter' referenced before
  assignment`` in ``_pytest.terminal.pytest_report_teststatus()``
  when plugins return report objects in an unconventional state.

  This was making ``pytest_report_teststatus()`` skip
  entering if-block branches that declare the ``letter`` variable.

  The fix was to set the initial value of the ``letter`` before
  the if-block cascade so that it always has a value.


pytest 4.6.10 (2020-05-08)
==========================

Features
--------

- :issue:`6870`: New ``Config.invocation_args`` attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to ``pytest.main()``.

  Remark: while this is technically a new feature and according to our
  `policy <https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/py27-py34-deprecation.html#what-goes-into-4-6-x-releases>`_
  it should not have been backported, we have opened an exception in this
  particular case because it fixes a serious interaction with ``pytest-xdist``,
  so it can also be considered a bugfix.

Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`6404`: Remove usage of ``parser`` module, deprecated in Python 3.9.


pytest 4.6.9 (2020-01-04)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

=========================

Features
--------

- :issue:`5471`: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.



Bug Fixes
---------

Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`6345`: Pin ``colorama`` to ``0.4.1`` only for Python 3.4 so newer Python versions can still receive colorama updates.


pytest 4.6.7 (2019-12-05)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`5477`: The XML file produced by ``--junitxml`` now correctly contain a ``<testsuites>`` root element.


- :issue:`6044`: Properly ignore ``FileNotFoundError`` (``OSError.errno == NOENT`` in Python 2) exceptions when trying to remove old temporary directories,
  for instance when multiple processes try to remove the same directory (common with ``pytest-xdist``
  for example).


pytest 4.6.6 (2019-10-11)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`5523`: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example ``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.

  standard library on Python 3.8+.


- :issue:`5806`: Fix "lexer" being used when uploading to bpaste.net from ``--pastebin`` to "text".


- :issue:`5902`: Fix warnings about deprecated ``cmp`` attribute in ``attrs>=19.2``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`5801`: Fixes python version checks (detected by ``flake8-2020``) in case python4 becomes a thing.


pytest 4.6.5 (2019-08-05)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`4344`: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with "__init__.py" only.


- :issue:`5478`: Fix encode error when using unicode strings in exceptions with ``pytest.raises``.


- :issue:`5524`: Fix issue where ``tmp_path`` and ``tmpdir`` would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,
  which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the ``--basetemp`` option.


- :issue:`5547`: ``--step-wise`` now handles ``xfail(strict=True)`` markers properly.


- :issue:`5650`: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.

pytest 4.6.4 (2019-06-28)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`5404`: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,
  for easier debugging (:issue:`5080`).

---------

- :issue:`5370`: Revert unrolling of ``all()`` to fix ``NameError`` on nested comprehensions.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan
<https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/py27-py34-deprecation.html>`_.


Features
--------

- :issue:`4559`: Added the ``junit_log_passing_tests`` ini value which can be used to enable or disable logging of passing test output in the Junit XML file.


- :issue:`4956`: pytester's ``testdir.spawn`` uses ``tmpdir`` as HOME/USERPROFILE directory.


- :issue:`5062`: Unroll calls to ``all`` to full for-loops with assertion rewriting for better failure messages, especially when using Generator Expressions.


- :issue:`5063`: Switch from ``pkg_resources`` to ``importlib-metadata`` for entrypoint detection for improved performance and import time.


- :issue:`5091`: The output for ini options in ``--help`` has been improved.


- :issue:`5269`: ``pytest.importorskip`` includes the ``ImportError`` now in the default ``reason``.


- :issue:`5311`: Captured logs that are output for each failing test are formatted using the
  ColoredLevelFormatter.


- :issue:`5312`: Improved formatting of multiline log messages in Python 3.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`2064`: The debugging plugin imports the wrapped ``Pdb`` class (``--pdbcls``) on-demand now.


- :issue:`4908`: The ``pytest_enter_pdb`` hook gets called with post-mortem (``--pdb``).


- :issue:`5036`: Fix issue where fixtures dependent on other parametrized fixtures would be erroneously parametrized.


- :issue:`5256`: Handle internal error due to a lone surrogate unicode character not being representable in Jython.


- :issue:`5257`: Ensure that ``sys.stdout.mode`` does not include ``'b'`` as it is a text stream.


- :issue:`5278`: Pytest's internal python plugin can be disabled using ``-p no:python`` again.


- :issue:`5286`: Fix issue with ``disable_test_id_escaping_and_forfeit_all_rights_to_community_support`` option not working when using a list of test IDs in parametrized tests.


- :issue:`5330`: Show the test module being collected when emitting ``PytestCollectionWarning`` messages for
  test classes with ``__init__`` and ``__new__`` methods to make it easier to pin down the problem.


- :issue:`5333`: Fix regression in 4.5.0 with ``--lf`` not re-running all tests with known failures from non-selected tests.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`5250`: Expand docs on use of ``setenv`` and ``delenv`` with ``monkeypatch``.


pytest 4.5.0 (2019-05-11)
=========================

Features
--------

- :issue:`4826`: A warning is now emitted when unknown marks are used as a decorator.
  This is often due to a typo, which can lead to silently broken tests.


- :issue:`4907`: Show XFail reason as part of JUnitXML message field.


- :issue:`5013`: Messages from crash reports are displayed within test summaries now, truncated to the terminal width.


- :issue:`5023`: New flag ``--strict-markers`` that triggers an error when unknown markers (e.g. those not registered using the :confval:`markers` option in the configuration file) are used in the test suite.

  The existing ``--strict`` option has the same behavior currently, but can be augmented in the future for additional checks.


- :issue:`5026`: Assertion failure messages for sequences and dicts contain the number of different items now.


- :issue:`5034`: Improve reporting with ``--lf`` and ``--ff`` (run-last-failure).


- :issue:`5035`: The ``--cache-show`` option/action accepts an optional glob to show only matching cache entries.


- :issue:`5059`: Standard input (stdin) can be given to pytester's ``Testdir.run()`` and ``Testdir.popen()``.


- :issue:`5068`: The ``-r`` option learnt about ``A`` to display all reports (including passed ones) in the short test summary.


- :issue:`5108`: The short test summary is displayed after passes with output (``-rP``).


- :issue:`5172`: The ``--last-failed`` (``--lf``) option got smarter and will now skip entire files if all tests
  of that test file have passed in previous runs, greatly speeding up collection.


- :issue:`5177`: Introduce new specific warning ``PytestWarning`` subclasses to make it easier to filter warnings based on the class, rather than on the message. The new subclasses are:


  * ``PytestAssertRewriteWarning``

  * ``PytestCacheWarning``

  * ``PytestCollectionWarning``

  * ``PytestConfigWarning``

  * ``PytestUnhandledCoroutineWarning``

  * ``PytestUnknownMarkWarning``


- :issue:`5202`: New ``record_testsuite_property`` session-scoped fixture allows users to log ``<property>`` tags at the ``testsuite``
  level with the ``junitxml`` plugin.

  The generated XML is compatible with the latest xunit standard, contrary to
  the properties recorded by ``record_property`` and ``record_xml_attribute``.


- :issue:`5214`: The default logging format has been changed to improve readability. Here is an
  example of a previous logging message::

      test_log_cli_enabled_disabled.py    3 CRITICAL critical message logged by test

  This has now become::

      CRITICAL root:test_log_cli_enabled_disabled.py:3 critical message logged by test

  The formatting can be changed through the :confval:`log_format` configuration option.


- :issue:`5220`: ``--fixtures`` now also shows fixture scope for scopes other than ``"function"``.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`5113`: Deselected items from plugins using ``pytest_collect_modifyitems`` as a hookwrapper are correctly reported now.


- :issue:`5144`: With usage errors ``exitstatus`` is set to ``EXIT_USAGEERROR`` in the ``pytest_sessionfinish`` hook now as expected.


- :issue:`5235`: ``outcome.exit`` is not used with ``EOF`` in the pdb wrapper anymore, but only with ``quit``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`4935`: Expand docs on registering marks and the effect of ``--strict``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`4942`: ``logging.raiseExceptions`` is not set to ``False`` anymore.


- :issue:`5013`: pytest now depends on :pypi:`wcwidth` to properly track unicode character sizes for more precise terminal output.


- :issue:`5059`: pytester's ``Testdir.popen()`` uses ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` via keyword arguments with defaults now (``subprocess.PIPE``).


- :issue:`5069`: The code for the short test summary in the terminal was moved to the terminal plugin.


- :issue:`5082`: Improved validation of kwargs for various methods in the pytester plugin.


- :issue:`5202`: ``record_property`` now emits a ``PytestWarning`` when used with ``junit_family=xunit2``: the fixture generates
  ``property`` tags as children of ``testcase``, which is not permitted according to the most
  `recent schema <https://github.com/jenkinsci/xunit-plugin/blob/master/
  src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/xunit/types/model/xsd/junit-10.xsd>`__.


- :issue:`5239`: Pin ``pluggy`` to ``< 1.0`` so we don't update to ``1.0`` automatically when
  it gets released: there are planned breaking changes, and we want to ensure
  pytest properly supports ``pluggy 1.0``.


pytest 4.4.2 (2019-05-08)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`5089`: Fix crash caused by error in ``__repr__`` function with both ``showlocals`` and verbose output enabled.


- :issue:`5139`: Eliminate core dependency on 'terminal' plugin.


- :issue:`5229`: Require ``pluggy>=0.11.0`` which reverts a dependency to ``importlib-metadata`` added in ``0.10.0``.
  The ``importlib-metadata`` package cannot be imported when installed as an egg and causes issues when relying on ``setup.py`` to install test dependencies.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`5171`: Doc: ``pytest_ignore_collect``, ``pytest_collect_directory``, ``pytest_collect_file`` and ``pytest_pycollect_makemodule`` hooks's 'path' parameter documented type is now ``py.path.local``


- :issue:`5188`: Improve help for ``--runxfail`` flag.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`5182`: Removed internal and unused ``_pytest.deprecated.MARK_INFO_ATTRIBUTE``.


pytest 4.4.1 (2019-04-15)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`5031`: Environment variables are properly restored when using pytester's ``testdir`` fixture.


- :issue:`5039`: Fix regression with ``--pdbcls``, which stopped working with local modules in 4.0.0.


- :issue:`5092`: Produce a warning when unknown keywords are passed to ``pytest.param(...)``.


- :issue:`5098`: Invalidate import caches with ``monkeypatch.syspath_prepend``, which is required with namespace packages being used.


pytest 4.4.0 (2019-03-29)
=========================

Features
--------

- :issue:`2224`: ``async`` test functions are skipped and a warning is emitted when a suitable
  async plugin is not installed (such as ``pytest-asyncio`` or ``pytest-trio``).

  Previously ``async`` functions would not execute at all but still be marked as "passed".


- :issue:`2482`: Include new ``disable_test_id_escaping_and_forfeit_all_rights_to_community_support`` option to disable ascii-escaping in parametrized values. This may cause a series of problems and as the name makes clear, use at your own risk.


- :issue:`4718`: The ``-p`` option can now be used to early-load plugins also by entry-point name, instead of just
  by module name.

  This makes it possible to early load external plugins like ``pytest-cov`` in the command-line::

      pytest -p pytest_cov


- :issue:`4855`: The ``--pdbcls`` option handles classes via module attributes now (e.g.
  ``pdb:pdb.Pdb`` with :pypi:`pdbpp`), and its validation was improved.


- :issue:`4875`: The :confval:`testpaths` configuration option is now displayed next
  to the ``rootdir`` and ``inifile`` lines in the pytest header if the option is in effect, i.e., directories or file names were
  not explicitly passed in the command line.

  Also, ``inifile`` is only displayed if there's a configuration file, instead of an empty ``inifile:`` string.


- :issue:`4911`: Doctests can be skipped now dynamically using ``pytest.skip()``.


- :issue:`4920`: Internal refactorings have been made in order to make the implementation of the
  `pytest-subtests <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-subtests>`__ plugin
  possible, which adds unittest sub-test support and a new ``subtests`` fixture as discussed in
  :issue:`1367`.

  For details on the internal refactorings, please see the details on the related PR.


- :issue:`4931`: pytester's ``LineMatcher`` asserts that the passed lines are a sequence.


- :issue:`4936`: Handle ``-p plug`` after ``-p no:plug``.

  This can be used to override a blocked plugin (e.g. in "addopts") from the
  command line etc.


- :issue:`4951`: Output capturing is handled correctly when only capturing via fixtures (capsys, capfs) with ``pdb.set_trace()``.


- :issue:`4956`: ``pytester`` sets ``$HOME`` and ``$USERPROFILE`` to the temporary directory during test runs.

  This ensures to not load configuration files from the real user's home directory.


- :issue:`4980`: Namespace packages are handled better with ``monkeypatch.syspath_prepend`` and ``testdir.syspathinsert`` (via ``pkg_resources.fixup_namespace_packages``).


- :issue:`4993`: The stepwise plugin reports status information now.


- :issue:`5008`: If a ``setup.cfg`` file contains ``[tool:pytest]`` and also the no longer supported ``[pytest]`` section, pytest will use ``[tool:pytest]`` ignoring ``[pytest]``. Previously it would unconditionally error out.

  This makes it simpler for plugins to support old pytest versions.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`1895`: Fix bug where fixtures requested dynamically via ``request.getfixturevalue()`` might be teardown
  before the requesting fixture.


- :issue:`4851`: pytester unsets ``PYTEST_ADDOPTS`` now to not use outer options with ``testdir.runpytest()``.


- :issue:`4903`: Use the correct modified time for years after 2038 in rewritten ``.pyc`` files.


- :issue:`4928`: Fix line offsets with ``ScopeMismatch`` errors.


- :issue:`4957`: ``-p no:plugin`` is handled correctly for default (internal) plugins now, e.g. with ``-p no:capture``.

  Previously they were loaded (imported) always, making e.g. the ``capfd`` fixture available.


- :issue:`4968`: The pdb ``quit`` command is handled properly when used after the ``debug`` command with :pypi:`pdbpp`.


- :issue:`4975`: Fix the interpretation of ``-qq`` option where it was being considered as ``-v`` instead.


- :issue:`4978`: ``outcomes.Exit`` is not swallowed in ``assertrepr_compare`` anymore.


- :issue:`4988`: Close logging's file handler explicitly when the session finishes.


- :issue:`5003`: Fix line offset with mark collection error (off by one).



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`4974`: Update docs for ``pytest_cmdline_parse`` hook to note availability limitations



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`4718`: ``pluggy>=0.9`` is now required.


- :issue:`4815`: ``funcsigs>=1.0`` is now required for Python 2.7.


- :issue:`4829`: Some left-over internal code related to ``yield`` tests has been removed.


- :issue:`4890`: Remove internally unused ``anypython`` fixture from the pytester plugin.


- :issue:`4912`: Remove deprecated Sphinx directive, ``add_description_unit()``,
  pin sphinx-removed-in to >= 0.2.0 to support Sphinx 2.0.


- :issue:`4913`: Fix pytest tests invocation with custom ``PYTHONPATH``.


- :issue:`4965`: New ``pytest_report_to_serializable`` and ``pytest_report_from_serializable`` **experimental** hooks.

  These hooks will be used by ``pytest-xdist``, ``pytest-subtests``, and the replacement for
  resultlog to serialize and customize reports.

  They are experimental, meaning that their details might change or even be removed
  completely in future patch releases without warning.

  Feedback is welcome from plugin authors and users alike.


- :issue:`4987`: ``Collector.repr_failure`` respects the ``--tb`` option, but only defaults to ``short`` now (with ``auto``).


pytest 4.3.1 (2019-03-11)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`4810`: Logging messages inside ``pytest_runtest_logreport()`` are now properly captured and displayed.


- :issue:`4861`: Improve validation of contents written to captured output so it behaves the same as when capture is disabled.


- :issue:`4898`: Fix ``AttributeError: FixtureRequest has no 'confg' attribute`` bug in ``testdir.copy_example``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`4768`: Avoid pkg_resources import at the top-level.


pytest 4.3.0 (2019-02-16)
=========================

Deprecations
------------

- :issue:`4724`: ``pytest.warns()`` now emits a warning when it receives unknown keyword arguments.

  This will be changed into an error in the future.



Features
--------

- :issue:`2753`: Usage errors from argparse are mapped to pytest's ``UsageError``.


- :issue:`3711`: Add the ``--ignore-glob`` parameter to exclude test-modules with Unix shell-style wildcards.
  Add the :globalvar:`collect_ignore_glob` for ``conftest.py`` to exclude test-modules with Unix shell-style wildcards.


- :issue:`4698`: The warning about Python 2.7 and 3.4 not being supported in pytest 5.0 has been removed.

  In the end it was considered to be more
  of a nuisance than actual utility and users of those Python versions shouldn't have problems as ``pip`` will not
  install pytest 5.0 on those interpreters.


- :issue:`4707`: With the help of new ``set_log_path()`` method there is a way to set ``log_file`` paths from hooks.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`4651`: ``--help`` and ``--version`` are handled with ``UsageError``.


- :issue:`4782`: Fix ``AssertionError`` with collection of broken symlinks with packages.


pytest 4.2.1 (2019-02-12)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`2895`: The ``pytest_report_collectionfinish`` hook now is also called with ``--collect-only``.


- :issue:`3899`: Do not raise ``UsageError`` when an imported package has a ``pytest_plugins.py`` child module.


- :issue:`4347`: Fix output capturing when using pdb++ with recursive debugging.


- :issue:`4592`: Fix handling of ``collect_ignore`` via parent ``conftest.py``.


- :issue:`4700`: Fix regression where ``setUpClass`` would always be called in subclasses even if all tests
  were skipped by a ``unittest.skip()`` decorator applied in the subclass.


- :issue:`4739`: Fix ``parametrize(... ids=<function>)`` when the function returns non-strings.


- :issue:`4745`: Fix/improve collection of args when passing in ``__init__.py`` and a test file.


- :issue:`4770`: ``more_itertools`` is now constrained to <6.0.0 when required for Python 2.7 compatibility.


- :issue:`526`: Fix "ValueError: Plugin already registered" exceptions when running in build directories that symlink to actual source.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`3899`: Add note to ``plugins.rst`` that ``pytest_plugins`` should not be used as a name for a user module containing plugins.


- :issue:`4324`: Document how to use ``raises`` and ``does_not_raise`` to write parametrized tests with conditional raises.


- :issue:`4709`: Document how to customize test failure messages when using
  ``pytest.warns``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`4741`: Some verbosity related attributes of the TerminalReporter plugin are now
  read only properties.


pytest 4.2.0 (2019-01-30)
=========================

Features
--------

- :issue:`3094`: :doc:`Classic xunit-style <how-to/xunit_setup>` functions and methods
  now obey the scope of *autouse* fixtures.

  This fixes a number of surprising issues like ``setup_method`` being called before session-scoped
  autouse fixtures (see :issue:`517` for an example).


- :issue:`4627`: Display a message at the end of the test session when running under Python 2.7 and 3.4 that pytest 5.0 will no longer
  support those Python versions.


- :issue:`4660`: The number of *selected* tests now are also displayed when the ``-k`` or ``-m`` flags are used.


- :issue:`4688`: ``pytest_report_teststatus`` hook now can also receive a ``config`` parameter.


- :issue:`4691`: ``pytest_terminal_summary`` hook now can also receive a ``config`` parameter.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`3547`: ``--junitxml`` can emit XML compatible with Jenkins xUnit.
  ``junit_family`` INI option accepts ``legacy|xunit1``, which produces old style output, and ``xunit2`` that conforms more strictly to https://github.com/jenkinsci/xunit-plugin/blob/xunit-2.3.2/src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/xunit/types/model/xsd/junit-10.xsd


- :issue:`4280`: Improve quitting from pdb, especially with ``--trace``.

  Using ``q[quit]`` after ``pdb.set_trace()`` will quit pytest also.


- :issue:`4402`: Warning summary now groups warnings by message instead of by test id.

  This makes the output more compact and better conveys the general idea of how much code is
  actually generating warnings, instead of how many tests call that code.


- :issue:`4536`: ``monkeypatch.delattr`` handles class descriptors like ``staticmethod``/``classmethod``.


- :issue:`4649`: Restore marks being considered keywords for keyword expressions.


- :issue:`4653`: ``tmp_path`` fixture and other related ones provides resolved path (a.k.a real path)


- :issue:`4667`: ``pytest_terminal_summary`` uses result from ``pytest_report_teststatus`` hook, rather than hardcoded strings.


- :issue:`4669`: Correctly handle ``unittest.SkipTest`` exception containing non-ascii characters on Python 2.


- :issue:`4680`: Ensure the ``tmpdir`` and the ``tmp_path`` fixtures are the same folder.


- :issue:`4681`: Ensure ``tmp_path`` is always a real path.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`4643`: Use ``a.item()`` instead of the deprecated ``np.asscalar(a)`` in ``pytest.approx``.

  ``np.asscalar`` has been :doc:`deprecated <numpy:release/1.16.0-notes>` in ``numpy 1.16.``.


- :issue:`4657`: Copy saferepr from pylib


- :issue:`4668`: The verbose word for expected failures in the teststatus report changes from ``xfail`` to ``XFAIL`` to be consistent with other test outcomes.


pytest 4.1.1 (2019-01-12)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`2256`: Show full repr with ``assert a==b`` and ``-vv``.


- :issue:`3456`: Extend Doctest-modules to ignore mock objects.


- :issue:`4617`: Fixed ``pytest.warns`` bug when context manager is reused (e.g. multiple parametrization).


- :issue:`4631`: Don't rewrite assertion when ``__getattr__`` is broken



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`3375`: Document that using ``setup.cfg`` may crash other tools or cause hard to track down problems because it uses a different parser than ``pytest.ini`` or ``tox.ini`` files.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`4602`: Uninstall ``hypothesis`` in regen tox env.


pytest 4.1.0 (2019-01-05)
=========================

Removals
--------

- :issue:`2169`: ``pytest.mark.parametrize``: in previous versions, errors raised by id functions were suppressed and changed into warnings. Now the exceptions are propagated, along with a pytest message informing the node, parameter value and index where the exception occurred.


- :issue:`3078`: Remove legacy internal warnings system: ``config.warn``, ``Node.warn``. The ``pytest_logwarning`` now issues a warning when implemented.

  See our :ref:`docs <config.warn and node.warn deprecated>` on information on how to update your code.


- :issue:`3079`: Removed support for yield tests - they are fundamentally broken because they don't support fixtures properly since collection and test execution were separated.

  See our :ref:`docs <yield tests deprecated>` on information on how to update your code.


- :issue:`3082`: Removed support for applying marks directly to values in ``@pytest.mark.parametrize``. Use ``pytest.param`` instead.

  See our :ref:`docs <marks in pytest.parametrize deprecated>` on information on how to update your code.


- :issue:`3083`: Removed ``Metafunc.addcall``. This was the predecessor mechanism to ``@pytest.mark.parametrize``.

  See our :ref:`docs <metafunc.addcall deprecated>` on information on how to update your code.


- :issue:`3085`: Removed support for passing strings to ``pytest.main``. Now, always pass a list of strings instead.

  See our :ref:`docs <passing command-line string to pytest.main deprecated>` on information on how to update your code.


- :issue:`3086`: ``[pytest]`` section in **setup.cfg** files is no longer supported, use ``[tool:pytest]`` instead. ``setup.cfg`` files
  are meant for use with ``distutils``, and a section named ``pytest`` has notoriously been a source of conflicts and bugs.

  Note that for **pytest.ini** and **tox.ini** files the section remains ``[pytest]``.


- :issue:`3616`: Removed the deprecated compat properties for ``node.Class/Function/Module`` - use ``pytest.Class/Function/Module`` now.

  See our :ref:`docs <internal classes accessed through node deprecated>` on information on how to update your code.


- :issue:`4421`: Removed the implementation of the ``pytest_namespace`` hook.

  See our :ref:`docs <pytest.namespace deprecated>` on information on how to update your code.


- :issue:`4489`: Removed ``request.cached_setup``. This was the predecessor mechanism to modern fixtures.

  See our :ref:`docs <cached_setup deprecated>` on information on how to update your code.


- :issue:`4535`: Removed the deprecated ``PyCollector.makeitem`` method. This method was made public by mistake a long time ago.


- :issue:`4543`: Removed support to define fixtures using the ``pytest_funcarg__`` prefix. Use the ``@pytest.fixture`` decorator instead.

  See our :ref:`docs <pytest_funcarg__ prefix deprecated>` on information on how to update your code.


- :issue:`4545`: Calling fixtures directly is now always an error instead of a warning.

  See our :ref:`docs <calling fixtures directly deprecated>` on information on how to update your code.


- :issue:`4546`: Remove ``Node.get_marker(name)`` the return value was not usable for more than an existence check.

  Use ``Node.get_closest_marker(name)`` as a replacement.


- :issue:`4547`: The deprecated ``record_xml_property`` fixture has been removed, use the more generic ``record_property`` instead.

  See our :ref:`docs <record_xml_property deprecated>` for more information.


- :issue:`4548`: An error is now raised if the ``pytest_plugins`` variable is defined in a non-top-level ``conftest.py`` file (i.e., not residing in the ``rootdir``).

  See our :ref:`docs <pytest_plugins in non-top-level conftest files deprecated>` for more information.


- :issue:`891`: Remove ``testfunction.markername`` attributes - use ``Node.iter_markers(name=None)`` to iterate them.



Deprecations
------------

- :issue:`3050`: Deprecated the ``pytest.config`` global.

  See :ref:`pytest.config global deprecated` for rationale.


- :issue:`3974`: Passing the ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises`` now issues a ``DeprecationWarning``.

  It is a common mistake to think this parameter will match the exception message, while in fact
  it only serves to provide a custom message in case the ``pytest.raises`` check fails. To avoid this
  mistake and because it is believed to be little used, pytest is deprecating it without providing
  an alternative for the moment.

  If you have concerns about this, please comment on :issue:`3974`.


- :issue:`4435`: Deprecated ``raises(..., 'code(as_a_string)')`` and ``warns(..., 'code(as_a_string)')``.

  See :std:ref:`raises-warns-exec` for rationale and examples.



Features
--------

- :issue:`3191`: A warning is now issued when assertions are made for ``None``.

  This is a common source of confusion among new users, which write:

  .. code-block:: python

      assert mocked_object.assert_called_with(3, 4, 5, key="value")

  When they should write:

  .. code-block:: python

      mocked_object.assert_called_with(3, 4, 5, key="value")

  Because the ``assert_called_with`` method of mock objects already executes an assertion.

  This warning will not be issued when ``None`` is explicitly checked. An assertion like:

  .. code-block:: python

      assert variable is None

  will not issue the warning.


- :issue:`3632`: Richer equality comparison introspection on ``AssertionError`` for objects created using `attrs <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/>`__ or :mod:`dataclasses` (Python 3.7+, :pypi:`backported to 3.6 <dataclasses>`).


- :issue:`4278`: ``CACHEDIR.TAG`` files are now created inside cache directories.

  Those files are part of the `Cache Directory Tagging Standard <https://bford.info/cachedir/spec.html>`__, and can
  be used by backup or synchronization programs to identify pytest's cache directory as such.


- :issue:`4292`: ``pytest.outcomes.Exit`` is derived from ``SystemExit`` instead of ``KeyboardInterrupt``. This allows us to better handle ``pdb`` exiting.


- :issue:`4371`: Updated the ``--collect-only`` option to display test descriptions when ran using ``--verbose``.


- :issue:`4386`: Restructured ``ExceptionInfo`` object construction and ensure incomplete instances have a ``repr``/``str``.


- :issue:`4416`: pdb: added support for keyword arguments with ``pdb.set_trace``.

  It handles ``header`` similar to Python 3.7 does it, and forwards any
  other keyword arguments to the ``Pdb`` constructor.

  This allows for ``__import__("pdb").set_trace(skip=["foo.*"])``.


- :issue:`4483`: Added ini parameter ``junit_duration_report`` to optionally report test call durations, excluding setup and teardown times.

  The JUnit XML specification and the default pytest behavior is to include setup and teardown times in the test duration
  report. You can include just the call durations instead (excluding setup and teardown) by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      junit_duration_report = call


- :issue:`4532`: ``-ra`` now will show errors and failures last, instead of as the first items in the summary.

  This makes it easier to obtain a list of errors and failures to run tests selectively.


- :issue:`4599`: ``pytest.importorskip`` now supports a ``reason`` parameter, which will be shown when the
  requested module cannot be imported.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`3532`: ``-p`` now accepts its argument without a space between the value, for example ``-pmyplugin``.


- :issue:`4327`: ``approx`` again works with more generic containers, more precisely instances of ``Iterable`` and ``Sized`` instead of more restrictive ``Sequence``.


- :issue:`4397`: Ensure that node ids are printable.


- :issue:`4435`: Fixed ``raises(..., 'code(string)')`` frame filename.


- :issue:`4458`: Display actual test ids in ``--collect-only``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`4557`: Markers example documentation page updated to support latest pytest version.


- :issue:`4558`: Update cache documentation example to correctly show cache hit and miss.


- :issue:`4580`: Improved detailed summary report documentation.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`4447`: Changed the deprecation type of ``--result-log`` to ``PytestDeprecationWarning``.

  It was decided to remove this feature at the next major revision.


pytest 4.0.2 (2018-12-13)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`4265`: Validate arguments from the ``PYTEST_ADDOPTS`` environment variable and the ``addopts`` ini option separately.


- :issue:`4435`: Fix ``raises(..., 'code(string)')`` frame filename.


- :issue:`4500`: When a fixture yields and a log call is made after the test runs, and, if the test is interrupted, capture attributes are ``None``.


- :issue:`4538`: Raise ``TypeError`` for ``with raises(..., match=<non-None falsey value>)``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`1495`: Document common doctest fixture directory tree structure pitfalls


pytest 4.0.1 (2018-11-23)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`3952`: Display warnings before "short test summary info" again, but still later warnings in the end.


- :issue:`4386`: Handle uninitialized exceptioninfo in repr/str.


- :issue:`4393`: Do not create ``.gitignore``/``README.md`` files in existing cache directories.


- :issue:`4400`: Rearrange warning handling for the yield test errors so the opt-out in 4.0.x correctly works.


- :issue:`4405`: Fix collection of testpaths with ``--pyargs``.


- :issue:`4412`: Fix assertion rewriting involving ``Starred`` + side-effects.


- :issue:`4425`: Ensure we resolve the absolute path when the given ``--basetemp`` is a relative path.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`4315`: Use ``pkg_resources.parse_version`` instead of ``LooseVersion`` in minversion check.


- :issue:`4440`: Adjust the stack level of some internal pytest warnings.


pytest 4.0.0 (2018-11-13)
=========================

Removals
--------

- :issue:`3737`: **RemovedInPytest4Warnings are now errors by default.**

  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
  possible, all warnings of type ``RemovedInPytest4Warnings`` now generate errors
  instead of warning messages.

  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 4.1**, so please consult the
  :std:doc:`deprecations` section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

  In the pytest ``4.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop
  gap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      filterwarnings =
          ignore::pytest.RemovedInPytest4Warning

  But this will stop working when pytest ``4.1`` is released.

  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
  comment to :issue:`4348`.


- :issue:`4358`: Remove the ``::()`` notation to denote a test class instance in node ids.

  Previously, node ids that contain test instances would use ``::()`` to denote the instance like this::

      test_foo.py::Test::()::test_bar

  The extra ``::()`` was puzzling to most users and has been removed, so that the test id becomes now::

      test_foo.py::Test::test_bar

  This change could not accompany a deprecation period as is usual when user-facing functionality changes because
  it was not really possible to detect when the functionality was being used explicitly.

  The extra ``::()`` might have been removed in some places internally already,
  which then led to confusion in places where it was expected, e.g. with
  ``--deselect`` (:issue:`4127`).

  Test class instances are also not listed with ``--collect-only`` anymore.



Features
--------

- :issue:`4270`: The ``cache_dir`` option uses ``$TOX_ENV_DIR`` as prefix (if set in the environment).

  This uses a different cache per tox environment by default.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`3554`: Fix ``CallInfo.__repr__`` for when the call is not finished yet.


pytest 3.10.1 (2018-11-11)
==========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`4287`: Fix nested usage of debugging plugin (pdb), e.g. with pytester's ``testdir.runpytest``.


- :issue:`4304`: Block the ``stepwise`` plugin if ``cacheprovider`` is also blocked, as one depends on the other.


- :issue:`4306`: Parse ``minversion`` as an actual version and not as dot-separated strings.


- :issue:`4310`: Fix duplicate collection due to multiple args matching the same packages.


- :issue:`4321`: Fix ``item.nodeid`` with resolved symlinks.


- :issue:`4325`: Fix collection of direct symlinked files, where the target does not match ``python_files``.


- :issue:`4329`: Fix TypeError in report_collect with _collect_report_last_write.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`4305`: Replace byte/unicode helpers in test_capture with python level syntax.


pytest 3.10.0 (2018-11-03)
==========================

Features
--------

- :issue:`2619`: Resume capturing output after ``continue`` with ``__import__("pdb").set_trace()``.

  This also adds a new ``pytest_leave_pdb`` hook, and passes in ``pdb`` to the
  existing ``pytest_enter_pdb`` hook.


- :issue:`4147`: Add ``--sw``, ``--stepwise`` as an alternative to ``--lf -x`` for stopping at the first failure, but starting the next test invocation from that test.  See :ref:`the documentation <cache stepwise>` for more info.


- :issue:`4188`: Make ``--color`` emit colorful dots when not running in verbose mode. Earlier, it would only colorize the test-by-test output if ``--verbose`` was also passed.


- :issue:`4225`: Improve performance with collection reporting in non-quiet mode with terminals.

  The "collecting …" message is only printed/updated every 0.5s.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`2701`: Fix false ``RemovedInPytest4Warning: usage of Session... is deprecated, please use pytest`` warnings.


- :issue:`4046`: Fix problems with running tests in package ``__init__.py`` files.


- :issue:`4260`: Swallow warnings during anonymous compilation of source.


- :issue:`4262`: Fix access denied error when deleting stale directories created by ``tmpdir`` / ``tmp_path``.


- :issue:`611`: Naming a fixture ``request`` will now raise a warning: the ``request`` fixture is internal and
  should not be overwritten as it will lead to internal errors.

- :issue:`4266`: Handle (ignore) exceptions raised during collection, e.g. with Django's LazySettings proxy class.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`4255`: Added missing documentation about the fact that module names passed to filter warnings are not regex-escaped.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`4272`: Display cachedir also in non-verbose mode if non-default.


- :issue:`4277`: pdb: improve message about output capturing with ``set_trace``.

  Do not display "IO-capturing turned off/on" when ``-s`` is used to avoid
  confusion.


- :issue:`4279`: Improve message and stack level of warnings issued by ``monkeypatch.setenv`` when the value of the environment variable is not a ``str``.


pytest 3.9.3 (2018-10-27)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`4174`: Fix "ValueError: Plugin already registered" with conftest plugins via symlink.


- :issue:`4181`: Handle race condition between creation and deletion of temporary folders.


- :issue:`4221`: Fix bug where the warning summary at the end of the test session was not showing the test where the warning was originated.


- :issue:`4243`: Fix regression when ``stacklevel`` for warnings was passed as positional argument on python2.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`3851`: Add reference to ``empty_parameter_set_mark`` ini option in documentation of ``@pytest.mark.parametrize``



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`4028`: Revert patching of ``sys.breakpointhook`` since it appears to do nothing.


- :issue:`4233`: Apply an import sorter (``reorder-python-imports``) to the codebase.


- :issue:`4248`: Remove use of unnecessary compat shim, six.binary_type


pytest 3.9.2 (2018-10-22)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`2909`: Improve error message when a recursive dependency between fixtures is detected.


- :issue:`3340`: Fix logging messages not shown in hooks ``pytest_sessionstart()`` and ``pytest_sessionfinish()``.


- :issue:`3533`: Fix unescaped XML raw objects in JUnit report for skipped tests


- :issue:`3691`: Python 2: safely format warning message about passing unicode strings to ``warnings.warn``, which may cause
  surprising ``MemoryError`` exception when monkey patching ``warnings.warn`` itself.


- :issue:`4026`: Improve error message when it is not possible to determine a function's signature.


- :issue:`4177`: Pin ``setuptools>=40.0`` to support ``py_modules`` in ``setup.cfg``


- :issue:`4179`: Restore the tmpdir behaviour of symlinking the current test run.


- :issue:`4192`: Fix filename reported by ``warnings.warn`` when using ``recwarn`` under python2.


pytest 3.9.1 (2018-10-16)
=========================

Features
--------

- :issue:`4159`: For test-suites containing test classes, the information about the subclassed
  module is now output only if a higher verbosity level is specified (at least
  "-vv").


pytest 3.9.0 (2018-10-15 - not published due to a release automation bug)
=========================================================================

Deprecations
------------

- :issue:`3616`: The following accesses have been documented as deprecated for years, but are now actually emitting deprecation warnings.

  * Access of ``Module``, ``Function``, ``Class``, ``Instance``, ``File`` and ``Item`` through ``Node`` instances. Now
    users will this warning::

          usage of Function.Module is deprecated, please use pytest.Module instead

    Users should just ``import pytest`` and access those objects using the ``pytest`` module.

  * ``request.cached_setup``, this was the precursor of the setup/teardown mechanism available to fixtures. You can
    consult :std:doc:`funcarg comparison section in the docs <funcarg_compare>`.

  * Using objects named ``"Class"`` as a way to customize the type of nodes that are collected in ``Collector``
    subclasses has been deprecated. Users instead should use ``pytest_collect_make_item`` to customize node types during
    collection.

    This issue should affect only advanced plugins who create new collection types, so if you see this warning
    message please contact the authors so they can change the code.

  * The warning that produces the message below has changed to ``RemovedInPytest4Warning``::

          getfuncargvalue is deprecated, use getfixturevalue


- :issue:`3988`: Add a Deprecation warning for pytest.ensuretemp as it was deprecated since a while.



Features
--------

- :issue:`2293`: Improve usage errors messages by hiding internal details which can be distracting and noisy.

  This has the side effect that some error conditions that previously raised generic errors (such as
  ``ValueError`` for unregistered marks) are now raising ``Failed`` exceptions.


- :issue:`3332`: Improve the error displayed when a ``conftest.py`` file could not be imported.

  In order to implement this, a new ``chain`` parameter was added to ``ExceptionInfo.getrepr``
  to show or hide chained tracebacks in Python 3 (defaults to ``True``).


- :issue:`3849`: Add ``empty_parameter_set_mark=fail_at_collect`` ini option for raising an exception when parametrize collects an empty set.


- :issue:`3964`: Log messages generated in the collection phase are shown when
  live-logging is enabled and/or when they are logged to a file.


- :issue:`3985`: Introduce ``tmp_path`` as a fixture providing a Path object. Also introduce ``tmp_path_factory`` as
  a session-scoped fixture for creating arbitrary temporary directories from any other fixture or test.


- :issue:`4013`: Deprecation warnings are now shown even if you customize the warnings filters yourself. In the previous version
  any customization would override pytest's filters and deprecation warnings would fall back to being hidden by default.


- :issue:`4073`: Allow specification of timeout for ``Testdir.runpytest_subprocess()`` and ``Testdir.run()``.


- :issue:`4098`: Add returncode argument to pytest.exit() to exit pytest with a specific return code.


- :issue:`4102`: Reimplement ``pytest.deprecated_call`` using ``pytest.warns`` so it supports the ``match='...'`` keyword argument.

  This has the side effect that ``pytest.deprecated_call`` now raises ``pytest.fail.Exception`` instead
  of ``AssertionError``.


- :issue:`4149`: Require setuptools>=30.3 and move most of the metadata to ``setup.cfg``.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`2535`: Improve error message when test functions of ``unittest.TestCase`` subclasses use a parametrized fixture.


- :issue:`3057`: ``request.fixturenames`` now correctly returns the name of fixtures created by ``request.getfixturevalue()``.


- :issue:`3946`: Warning filters passed as command line options using ``-W`` now take precedence over filters defined in ``ini``
  configuration files.


- :issue:`4066`: Fix source reindenting by using ``textwrap.dedent`` directly.


- :issue:`4102`: ``pytest.warn`` will capture previously-warned warnings in Python 2. Previously they were never raised.


- :issue:`4108`: Resolve symbolic links for args.

  This fixes running ``pytest tests/test_foo.py::test_bar``, where ``tests``
  is a symlink to ``project/app/tests``:
  previously ``project/app/conftest.py`` would be ignored for fixtures then.


- :issue:`4132`: Fix duplicate printing of internal errors when using ``--pdb``.


- :issue:`4135`: pathlib based tmpdir cleanup now correctly handles symlinks in the folder.


- :issue:`4152`: Display the filename when encountering ``SyntaxWarning``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`3713`: Update usefixtures documentation to clarify that it can't be used with fixture functions.


- :issue:`4058`: Update fixture documentation to specify that a fixture can be invoked twice in the scope it's defined for.


- :issue:`4064`: According to unittest.rst, setUpModule and tearDownModule were not implemented, but it turns out they are. So updated the documentation for unittest.


- :issue:`4151`: Add tempir testing example to CONTRIBUTING.rst guide



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`2293`: The internal ``MarkerError`` exception has been removed.


- :issue:`3988`: Port the implementation of tmpdir to pathlib.


- :issue:`4063`: Exclude 0.00 second entries from ``--duration`` output unless ``-vv`` is passed on the command-line.


- :issue:`4093`: Fixed formatting of string literals in internal tests.


pytest 3.8.2 (2018-10-02)
=========================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- :issue:`4036`: The ``item`` parameter of ``pytest_warning_captured`` hook is now documented as deprecated. We realized only after
  the ``3.8`` release that this parameter is incompatible with ``pytest-xdist``.

  Our policy is to not deprecate features during bug-fix releases, but in this case we believe it makes sense as we are
  only documenting it as deprecated, without issuing warnings which might potentially break test suites. This will get
  the word out that hook implementers should not use this parameter at all.

  In a future release ``item`` will always be ``None`` and will emit a proper warning when a hook implementation
  makes use of it.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`3539`: Fix reload on assertion rewritten modules.


- :issue:`4034`: The ``.user_properties`` attribute of ``TestReport`` objects is a list
  of (name, value) tuples, but could sometimes be instantiated as a tuple
  of tuples.  It is now always a list.


- :issue:`4039`: No longer issue warnings about using ``pytest_plugins`` in non-top-level directories when using ``--pyargs``: the
  current ``--pyargs`` mechanism is not reliable and might give false negatives.


- :issue:`4040`: Exclude empty reports for passed tests when ``-rP`` option is used.


- :issue:`4051`: Improve error message when an invalid Python expression is passed to the ``-m`` option.


- :issue:`4056`: ``MonkeyPatch.setenv`` and ``MonkeyPatch.delenv`` issue a warning if the environment variable name is not ``str`` on Python 2.

  In Python 2, adding ``unicode`` keys to ``os.environ`` causes problems with ``subprocess`` (and possible other modules),
  making this a subtle bug specially susceptible when used with ``from __future__ import unicode_literals``.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`3928`: Add possible values for fixture scope to docs.


pytest 3.8.1 (2018-09-22)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`3286`: ``.pytest_cache`` directory is now automatically ignored by Git. Users who would like to contribute a solution for other SCMs please consult/comment on this issue.


- :issue:`3749`: Fix the following error during collection of tests inside packages::

      TypeError: object of type 'Package' has no len()


- :issue:`3941`: Fix bug where indirect parametrization would consider the scope of all fixtures used by the test function to determine the parametrization scope, and not only the scope of the fixtures being parametrized.


- :issue:`3973`: Fix crash of the assertion rewriter if a test changed the current working directory without restoring it afterwards.


- :issue:`3998`: Fix issue that prevented some caplog properties (for example ``record_tuples``) from being available when entering the debugger with ``--pdb``.


- :issue:`3999`: Fix ``UnicodeDecodeError`` in python2.x when a class returns a non-ascii binary ``__repr__`` in an assertion which also contains non-ascii text.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`3996`: New :std:doc:`deprecations` page shows all currently
  deprecated features, the rationale to do so, and alternatives to update your code. It also list features removed
  from pytest in past major releases to help those with ancient pytest versions to upgrade.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`3955`: Improve pre-commit detection for changelog filenames


- :issue:`3975`: Remove legacy code around im_func as that was python2 only


pytest 3.8.0 (2018-09-05)
=========================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- :issue:`2452`: ``Config.warn`` and ``Node.warn`` have been
  deprecated, see :ref:`config.warn and node.warn deprecated` for rationale and
  examples.

- :issue:`3936`: ``@pytest.mark.filterwarnings`` second parameter is no longer regex-escaped,
  making it possible to actually use regular expressions to check the warning message.

  **Note**: regex-escaping the match string was an implementation oversight that might break test suites which depend
  on the old behavior.



Features
--------

- :issue:`2452`: Internal pytest warnings are now issued using the standard ``warnings`` module, making it possible to use
  the standard warnings filters to manage those warnings. This introduces ``PytestWarning``,
  ``PytestDeprecationWarning`` and ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` warning types as part of the public API.

  Consult :ref:`the documentation <internal-warnings>` for more info.


- :issue:`2908`: ``DeprecationWarning`` and ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` are now shown by default if no other warning filter is
  configured. This makes pytest more compliant with
  :pep:`506#recommended-filter-settings-for-test-runners`. See
  :ref:`the docs <deprecation-warnings>` for
  more info.


- :issue:`3251`: Warnings are now captured and displayed during test collection.


- :issue:`3784`: ``PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD`` environment variable disables plugin auto-loading when set.


- :issue:`3829`: Added the ``count`` option to ``console_output_style`` to enable displaying the progress as a count instead of a percentage.


- :issue:`3837`: Added support for 'xfailed' and 'xpassed' outcomes to the ``pytester.RunResult.assert_outcomes`` signature.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`3911`: Terminal writer now takes into account unicode character width when writing out progress.


- :issue:`3913`: Pytest now returns with correct exit code (EXIT_USAGEERROR, 4) when called with unknown arguments.


- :issue:`3918`: Improve performance of assertion rewriting.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`3566`: Added a blurb in usage.rst for the usage of -r flag which is used to show an extra test summary info.


- :issue:`3907`: Corrected type of the exceptions collection passed to ``xfail``: ``raises`` argument accepts a ``tuple`` instead of ``list``.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`3853`: Removed ``"run all (no recorded failures)"`` message printed with ``--failed-first`` and ``--last-failed`` when there are no failed tests.


pytest 3.7.4 (2018-08-29)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`3506`: Fix possible infinite recursion when writing ``.pyc`` files.


- :issue:`3853`: Cache plugin now obeys the ``-q`` flag when ``--last-failed`` and ``--failed-first`` flags are used.


- :issue:`3883`: Fix bad console output when using ``console_output_style=classic``.


- :issue:`3888`: Fix macOS specific code using ``capturemanager`` plugin in doctests.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`3902`: Fix pytest.org links


pytest 3.7.3 (2018-08-26)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`3033`: Fixtures during teardown can again use ``capsys`` and ``capfd`` to inspect output captured during tests.


- :issue:`3773`: Fix collection of tests from ``__init__.py`` files if they match the ``python_files`` configuration option.


- :issue:`3796`: Fix issue where teardown of fixtures of consecutive sub-packages were executed once, at the end of the outer
  package.


- :issue:`3816`: Fix bug where ``--show-capture=no`` option would still show logs printed during fixture teardown.


- :issue:`3819`: Fix ``stdout/stderr`` not getting captured when real-time cli logging is active.


- :issue:`3843`: Fix collection error when specifying test functions directly in the command line using ``test.py::test`` syntax together with ``--doctest-modules``.


- :issue:`3848`: Fix bugs where unicode arguments could not be passed to ``testdir.runpytest`` on Python 2.


- :issue:`3854`: Fix double collection of tests within packages when the filename starts with a capital letter.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`3824`: Added example for multiple glob pattern matches in ``python_files``.


- :issue:`3833`: Added missing docs for ``pytester.Testdir``.


- :issue:`3870`: Correct documentation for setuptools integration.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`3826`: Replace broken type annotations with type comments.


- :issue:`3845`: Remove a reference to issue :issue:`568` from the documentation, which has since been
  fixed.


pytest 3.7.2 (2018-08-16)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`3671`: Fix ``filterwarnings`` not being registered as a builtin mark.


- :issue:`3768`, :issue:`3789`: Fix test collection from packages mixed with normal directories.


- :issue:`3771`: Fix infinite recursion during collection if a ``pytest_ignore_collect`` hook returns ``False`` instead of ``None``.


- :issue:`3774`: Fix bug where decorated fixtures would lose functionality (for example ``@mock.patch``).


- :issue:`3775`: Fix bug where importing modules or other objects with prefix ``pytest_`` prefix would raise a ``PluginValidationError``.


- :issue:`3788`: Fix ``AttributeError`` during teardown of ``TestCase`` subclasses which raise an exception during ``__init__``.


- :issue:`3804`: Fix traceback reporting for exceptions with ``__cause__`` cycles.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`3746`: Add documentation for ``metafunc.config`` that had been mistakenly hidden.


pytest 3.7.1 (2018-08-02)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`3473`: Raise immediately if ``approx()`` is given an expected value of a type it doesn't understand (e.g. strings, nested dicts, etc.).


- :issue:`3712`: Correctly represent the dimensions of a numpy array when calling ``repr()`` on ``approx()``.

- :issue:`3742`: Fix incompatibility with third party plugins during collection, which produced the error ``object has no attribute '_collectfile'``.

- :issue:`3745`: Display the absolute path if ``cache_dir`` is not relative to the ``rootdir`` instead of failing.


- :issue:`3747`: Fix compatibility problem with plugins and the warning code issued by fixture functions when they are called directly.


- :issue:`3748`: Fix infinite recursion in ``pytest.approx`` with arrays in ``numpy<1.13``.


- :issue:`3757`: Pin pathlib2 to ``>=2.2.0`` as we require ``__fspath__`` support.


- :issue:`3763`: Fix ``TypeError`` when the assertion message is ``bytes`` in python 3.


pytest 3.7.0 (2018-07-30)
=========================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- :issue:`2639`: ``pytest_namespace`` has been :ref:`deprecated <pytest.namespace deprecated>`.


- :issue:`3661`: Calling a fixture function directly, as opposed to request them in a test function, now issues a ``RemovedInPytest4Warning``. See :ref:`the documentation for rationale and examples <calling fixtures directly deprecated>`.



Features
--------

- :issue:`2283`: New ``package`` fixture scope: fixtures are finalized when the last test of a *package* finishes. This feature is considered **experimental**, so use it sparingly.


- :issue:`3576`: ``Node.add_marker`` now supports an ``append=True/False`` parameter to determine whether the mark comes last (default) or first.


- :issue:`3579`: Fixture ``caplog`` now has a ``messages`` property, providing convenient access to the format-interpolated log messages without the extra data provided by the formatter/handler.


- :issue:`3610`: New ``--trace`` option to enter the debugger at the start of a test.


- :issue:`3623`: Introduce ``pytester.copy_example`` as helper to do acceptance tests against examples from the project.



Bug Fixes
---------

- :issue:`2220`: Fix a bug where fixtures overridden by direct parameters (for example parametrization) were being instantiated even if they were not being used by a test.


- :issue:`3695`: Fix ``ApproxNumpy`` initialisation argument mixup, ``abs`` and ``rel`` tolerances were flipped causing strange comparison results.
  Add tests to check ``abs`` and ``rel`` tolerances for ``np.array`` and test for expecting ``nan`` with ``np.array()``


- :issue:`980`: Fix truncated locals output in verbose mode.



Improved Documentation
----------------------

- :issue:`3295`: Correct the usage documentation of ``--last-failed-no-failures`` by adding the missing ``--last-failed`` argument in the presented examples, because they are misleading and lead to think that the missing argument is not needed.



Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- :issue:`3519`: Now a ``README.md`` file is created in ``.pytest_cache`` to make it clear why the directory exists.


pytest 3.6.4 (2018-07-28)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Invoke pytest using ``-mpytest`` so ``sys.path`` does not get polluted by packages installed in ``site-packages``. (:issue:`742`)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Use ``smtp_connection`` instead of ``smtp`` in fixtures documentation to avoid possible confusion. (:issue:`3592`)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Remove obsolete ``__future__`` imports. (:issue:`2319`)

- Add CITATION to provide information on how to formally cite pytest. (:issue:`3402`)

- Replace broken type annotations with type comments. (:issue:`3635`)

- Pin ``pluggy`` to ``<0.8``. (:issue:`3727`)


pytest 3.6.3 (2018-07-04)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix ``ImportWarning`` triggered by explicit relative imports in
  assertion-rewritten package modules. (:issue:`3061`)

- Fix error in ``pytest.approx`` when dealing with 0-dimension numpy
  arrays. (:issue:`3593`)

- No longer raise ``ValueError`` when using the ``get_marker`` API. (:issue:`3605`)

- Fix problem where log messages with non-ascii characters would not
  appear in the output log file.
  (:issue:`3630`)

- No longer raise ``AttributeError`` when legacy marks can't be stored in
  functions. (:issue:`3631`)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- The description above the example for ``@pytest.mark.skipif`` now better
  matches the code. (:issue:`3611`)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Internal refactoring: removed unused ``CallSpec2tox ._globalid_args``
  attribute and ``metafunc`` parameter from ``CallSpec2.copy()``. (:issue:`3598`)

- Silence usage of ``reduce`` warning in Python 2 (:issue:`3609`)

- Fix usage of ``attr.ib`` deprecated ``convert`` parameter. (:issue:`3653`)


pytest 3.6.2 (2018-06-20)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix regression in ``Node.add_marker`` by extracting the mark object of a
  ``MarkDecorator``. (:issue:`3555`)

- Warnings without ``location`` were reported as ``None``. This is corrected to
  now report ``<undetermined location>``. (:issue:`3563`)

- Continue to call finalizers in the stack when a finalizer in a former scope
  raises an exception. (:issue:`3569`)

- Fix encoding error with ``print`` statements in doctests (:issue:`3583`)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Add documentation for the ``--strict`` flag. (:issue:`3549`)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Update old quotation style to parens in fixture.rst documentation. (:issue:`3525`)

- Improve display of hint about ``--fulltrace`` with ``KeyboardInterrupt``.
  (:issue:`3545`)

- pytest's testsuite is no longer runnable through ``python setup.py test`` --
  instead invoke ``pytest`` or ``tox`` directly. (:issue:`3552`)

- Fix typo in documentation (:issue:`3567`)


pytest 3.6.1 (2018-06-05)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed a bug where stdout and stderr were logged twice by junitxml when a test
  was marked xfail. (:issue:`3491`)

- Fix ``usefixtures`` mark applied to unittest tests by correctly instantiating
  ``FixtureInfo``. (:issue:`3498`)

- Fix assertion rewriter compatibility with libraries that monkey patch
  ``file`` objects. (:issue:`3503`)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Added a section on how to use fixtures as factories to the fixture
  documentation. (:issue:`3461`)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Enable caching for pip/pre-commit in order to reduce build time on
  travis/appveyor. (:issue:`3502`)

- Switch pytest to the src/ layout as we already suggested it for good practice
  - now we implement it as well. (:issue:`3513`)

- Fix if in tests to support 3.7.0b5, where a docstring handling in AST got
  reverted. (:issue:`3530`)

- Remove some python2.5 compatibility code. (:issue:`3529`)


pytest 3.6.0 (2018-05-23)
=========================

Features
--------

- Revamp the internals of the ``pytest.mark`` implementation with correct per
  node handling which fixes a number of long standing bugs caused by the old
  design. This introduces new ``Node.iter_markers(name)`` and
  ``Node.get_closest_marker(name)`` APIs. Users are **strongly encouraged** to
  read the :ref:`reasons for the revamp in the docs <marker-revamp>`,
  or jump over to details about :ref:`updating existing code to use the new APIs
  <update marker code>`.
  (:issue:`3317`)

- Now when ``@pytest.fixture`` is applied more than once to the same function a
  ``ValueError`` is raised. This buggy behavior would cause surprising problems
  and if was working for a test suite it was mostly by accident. (:issue:`2334`)

- Support for Python 3.7's builtin ``breakpoint()`` method, see
  :ref:`Using the builtin breakpoint function <breakpoint-builtin>` for
  details. (:issue:`3180`)

- ``monkeypatch`` now supports a ``context()`` function which acts as a context
  manager which undoes all patching done within the ``with`` block. (:issue:`3290`)

- The ``--pdb`` option now causes KeyboardInterrupt to enter the debugger,
  instead of stopping the test session. On python 2.7, hitting CTRL+C again
  exits the debugger. On python 3.2 and higher, use CTRL+D. (:issue:`3299`)

- pytest no longer changes the log level of the root logger when the
  ``log-level`` parameter has greater numeric value than that of the level of
  the root logger, which makes it play better with custom logging configuration
  in user code. (:issue:`3307`)


Bug Fixes
---------

- A rare race-condition which might result in corrupted ``.pyc`` files on
  Windows has been hopefully solved. (:issue:`3008`)

- Also use iter_marker for discovering the marks applying for marker
  expressions from the cli to avoid the bad data from the legacy mark storage.
  (:issue:`3441`)

- When showing diffs of failed assertions where the contents contain only
  whitespace, escape them using ``repr()`` first to make it easy to spot the
  differences. (:issue:`3443`)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Change documentation copyright year to a range which auto-updates itself each
  time it is published. (:issue:`3303`)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- ``pytest`` now depends on the `python-atomicwrites
  <https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites>`_ library. (:issue:`3008`)

- Update all pypi.python.org URLs to pypi.org. (:issue:`3431`)

- Detect `pytest_` prefixed hooks using the internal plugin manager since
  ``pluggy`` is deprecating the ``implprefix`` argument to ``PluginManager``.
  (:issue:`3487`)

- Import ``Mapping`` and ``Sequence`` from ``_pytest.compat`` instead of
  directly from ``collections`` in ``python_api.py::approx``. Add ``Mapping``
  to ``_pytest.compat``, import it from ``collections`` on python 2, but from
  ``collections.abc`` on Python 3 to avoid a ``DeprecationWarning`` on Python
  3.7 or newer. (:issue:`3497`)


pytest 3.5.1 (2018-04-23)
=========================


Bug Fixes
---------

- Reset ``sys.last_type``, ``sys.last_value`` and ``sys.last_traceback`` before
  each test executes. Those attributes are added by pytest during the test run
  to aid debugging, but were never reset so they would create a leaking
  reference to the last failing test's frame which in turn could never be
  reclaimed by the garbage collector. (:issue:`2798`)

- ``pytest.raises`` now raises ``TypeError`` when receiving an unknown keyword
  argument. (:issue:`3348`)

- ``pytest.raises`` now works with exception classes that look like iterables.
  (:issue:`3372`)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Fix typo in ``caplog`` fixture documentation, which incorrectly identified
  certain attributes as methods. (:issue:`3406`)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Added a more indicative error message when parametrizing a function whose
  argument takes a default value. (:issue:`3221`)

- Remove internal ``_pytest.terminal.flatten`` function in favor of
  ``more_itertools.collapse``. (:issue:`3330`)

- Import some modules from ``collections.abc`` instead of ``collections`` as
  the former modules trigger ``DeprecationWarning`` in Python 3.7. (:issue:`3339`)

- record_property is no longer experimental, removing the warnings was
  forgotten. (:issue:`3360`)

- Mention in documentation and CLI help that fixtures with leading ``_`` are
  printed by ``pytest --fixtures`` only if the ``-v`` option is added. (:issue:`3398`)


pytest 3.5.0 (2018-03-21)
=========================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- ``record_xml_property`` fixture is now deprecated in favor of the more
  generic ``record_property``. (:issue:`2770`)

- Defining ``pytest_plugins`` is now deprecated in non-top-level conftest.py
  files, because they "leak" to the entire directory tree.
  :ref:`See the docs <pytest_plugins in non-top-level conftest files deprecated>`
  for the rationale behind this decision (:issue:`3084`)


Features
--------

- New ``--show-capture`` command-line option that allows to specify how to
  display captured output when tests fail: ``no``, ``stdout``, ``stderr``,
  ``log`` or ``all`` (the default). (:issue:`1478`)

- New ``--rootdir`` command-line option to override the rules for discovering
  the root directory. See :doc:`customize <reference/customize>` in the documentation for
  details. (:issue:`1642`)

- Fixtures are now instantiated based on their scopes, with higher-scoped
  fixtures (such as ``session``) being instantiated first than lower-scoped
  fixtures (such as ``function``). The relative order of fixtures of the same
  scope is kept unchanged, based in their declaration order and their
  dependencies. (:issue:`2405`)

- ``record_xml_property`` renamed to ``record_property`` and is now compatible
  with xdist, markers and any reporter. ``record_xml_property`` name is now
  deprecated. (:issue:`2770`)

- New ``--nf``, ``--new-first`` options: run new tests first followed by the
  rest of the tests, in both cases tests are also sorted by the file modified
  time, with more recent files coming first. (:issue:`3034`)

- New ``--last-failed-no-failures`` command-line option that allows to specify
  the behavior of the cache plugin's ```--last-failed`` feature when no tests
  failed in the last run (or no cache was found): ``none`` or ``all`` (the
  default). (:issue:`3139`)

- New ``--doctest-continue-on-failure`` command-line option to enable doctests
  to show multiple failures for each snippet, instead of stopping at the first
  failure. (:issue:`3149`)

- Captured log messages are added to the ``<system-out>`` tag in the generated
  junit xml file if the ``junit_logging`` ini option is set to ``system-out``.
  If the value of this ini option is ``system-err``, the logs are written to
  ``<system-err>``. The default value for ``junit_logging`` is ``no``, meaning
  captured logs are not written to the output file. (:issue:`3156`)

- Allow the logging plugin to handle ``pytest_runtest_logstart`` and
  ``pytest_runtest_logfinish`` hooks when live logs are enabled. (:issue:`3189`)

- Passing ``--log-cli-level`` in the command-line now automatically activates
  live logging. (:issue:`3190`)

- Add command line option ``--deselect`` to allow deselection of individual
  tests at collection time. (:issue:`3198`)

- Captured logs are printed before entering pdb. (:issue:`3204`)

- Deselected item count is now shown before tests are run, e.g. ``collected X
  items / Y deselected``. (:issue:`3213`)

- The builtin module ``platform`` is now available for use in expressions in
  ``pytest.mark``. (:issue:`3236`)

- The *short test summary info* section now is displayed after tracebacks and
  warnings in the terminal. (:issue:`3255`)

- New ``--verbosity`` flag to set verbosity level explicitly. (:issue:`3296`)

- ``pytest.approx`` now accepts comparing a numpy array with a scalar. (:issue:`3312`)


Bug Fixes
---------

- Suppress ``IOError`` when closing the temporary file used for capturing
  streams in Python 2.7. (:issue:`2370`)

- Fixed ``clear()`` method on ``caplog`` fixture which cleared ``records``, but
  not the ``text`` property. (:issue:`3297`)

- During test collection, when stdin is not allowed to be read, the
  ``DontReadFromStdin`` object still allow itself to be iterable and resolved
  to an iterator without crashing. (:issue:`3314`)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Added a :doc:`reference <reference/reference>` page
  to the docs. (:issue:`1713`)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Change minimum requirement of ``attrs`` to ``17.4.0``. (:issue:`3228`)

- Renamed example directories so all tests pass when ran from the base
  directory. (:issue:`3245`)

- Internal ``mark.py`` module has been turned into a package. (:issue:`3250`)

- ``pytest`` now depends on the `more-itertools
  <https://github.com/erikrose/more-itertools>`_ package. (:issue:`3265`)

- Added warning when ``[pytest]`` section is used in a ``.cfg`` file passed
  with ``-c`` (:issue:`3268`)

- ``nodeids`` can now be passed explicitly to ``FSCollector`` and ``Node``
  constructors. (:issue:`3291`)

- Internal refactoring of ``FormattedExcinfo`` to use ``attrs`` facilities and
  remove old support code for legacy Python versions. (:issue:`3292`)

- Refactoring to unify how verbosity is handled internally. (:issue:`3296`)

- Internal refactoring to better integrate with argparse. (:issue:`3304`)

- Fix a python example when calling a fixture in doc/en/usage.rst (:issue:`3308`)


pytest 3.4.2 (2018-03-04)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Removed progress information when capture option is ``no``. (:issue:`3203`)

- Refactor check of bindir from ``exists`` to ``isdir``. (:issue:`3241`)

- Fix ``TypeError`` issue when using ``approx`` with a ``Decimal`` value.
  (:issue:`3247`)

- Fix reference cycle generated when using the ``request`` fixture. (:issue:`3249`)

- ``[tool:pytest]`` sections in ``*.cfg`` files passed by the ``-c`` option are
  now properly recognized. (:issue:`3260`)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Add logging plugin to plugins list. (:issue:`3209`)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Fix minor typo in fixture.rst (:issue:`3259`)


pytest 3.4.1 (2018-02-20)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Move import of ``doctest.UnexpectedException`` to top-level to avoid possible
  errors when using ``--pdb``. (:issue:`1810`)

- Added printing of captured stdout/stderr before entering pdb, and improved a
  test which was giving false negatives about output capturing. (:issue:`3052`)

- Fix ordering of tests using parametrized fixtures which can lead to fixtures
  being created more than necessary. (:issue:`3161`)

- Fix bug where logging happening at hooks outside of "test run" hooks would
  cause an internal error. (:issue:`3184`)

- Detect arguments injected by ``unittest.mock.patch`` decorator correctly when
  pypi ``mock.patch`` is installed and imported. (:issue:`3206`)

- Errors shown when a ``pytest.raises()`` with ``match=`` fails are now cleaner
  on what happened: When no exception was raised, the "matching '...'" part got
  removed as it falsely implies that an exception was raised but it didn't
  match. When a wrong exception was raised, it's now thrown (like
  ``pytest.raised()`` without ``match=`` would) instead of complaining about
  the unmatched text. (:issue:`3222`)

- Fixed output capture handling in doctests on macOS. (:issue:`985`)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Add Sphinx parameter docs for ``match`` and ``message`` args to
  ``pytest.raises``. (:issue:`3202`)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- pytest has changed the publication procedure and is now being published to
  PyPI directly from Travis. (:issue:`3060`)

- Rename ``ParameterSet._for_parameterize()`` to ``_for_parametrize()`` in
  order to comply with the naming convention. (:issue:`3166`)

- Skip failing pdb/doctest test on mac. (:issue:`985`)


pytest 3.4.0 (2018-01-30)
=========================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- All pytest classes now subclass ``object`` for better Python 2/3 compatibility.
  This should not affect user code except in very rare edge cases. (:issue:`2147`)


Features
--------

- Introduce ``empty_parameter_set_mark`` ini option to select which mark to
  apply when ``@pytest.mark.parametrize`` is given an empty set of parameters.
  Valid options are ``skip`` (default) and ``xfail``. Note that it is planned
  to change the default to ``xfail`` in future releases as this is considered
  less error prone. (:issue:`2527`)

- **Incompatible change**: after community feedback the :doc:`logging <how-to/logging>` functionality has
  undergone some changes. Please consult the :ref:`logging documentation <log_changes_3_4>`
  for details. (:issue:`3013`)

- Console output falls back to "classic" mode when capturing is disabled (``-s``),
  otherwise the output gets garbled to the point of being useless. (:issue:`3038`)

- New :hook:`pytest_runtest_logfinish`
  hook which is called when a test item has finished executing, analogous to
  :hook:`pytest_runtest_logstart`.
  (:issue:`3101`)

- Improve performance when collecting tests using many fixtures. (:issue:`3107`)

- New ``caplog.get_records(when)`` method which provides access to the captured
  records for the ``"setup"``, ``"call"`` and ``"teardown"``
  testing stages. (:issue:`3117`)

- New fixture ``record_xml_attribute`` that allows modifying and inserting
  attributes on the ``<testcase>`` xml node in JUnit reports. (:issue:`3130`)

- The default cache directory has been renamed from ``.cache`` to
  ``.pytest_cache`` after community feedback that the name ``.cache`` did not
  make it clear that it was used by pytest. (:issue:`3138`)

- Colorize the levelname column in the live-log output. (:issue:`3142`)


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix hanging pexpect test on macOS by using flush() instead of wait().
  (:issue:`2022`)

- Fix restoring Python state after in-process pytest runs with the
  ``pytester`` plugin; this may break tests using multiple inprocess
  pytest runs if later ones depend on earlier ones leaking global interpreter
  changes. (:issue:`3016`)

- Fix skipping plugin reporting hook when test aborted before plugin setup
  hook. (:issue:`3074`)

- Fix progress percentage reported when tests fail during teardown. (:issue:`3088`)

- **Incompatible change**: ``-o/--override`` option no longer eats all the
  remaining options, which can lead to surprising behavior: for example,
  ``pytest -o foo=1 /path/to/test.py`` would fail because ``/path/to/test.py``
  would be considered as part of the ``-o`` command-line argument. One
  consequence of this is that now multiple configuration overrides need
  multiple ``-o`` flags: ``pytest -o foo=1 -o bar=2``. (:issue:`3103`)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Document hooks (defined with ``historic=True``) which cannot be used with
  ``hookwrapper=True``. (:issue:`2423`)

- Clarify that warning capturing doesn't change the warning filter by default.
  (:issue:`2457`)

- Clarify a possible confusion when using pytest_fixture_setup with fixture
  functions that return None. (:issue:`2698`)

- Fix the wording of a sentence on doctest flags used in pytest. (:issue:`3076`)

- Prefer ``https://*.readthedocs.io`` over ``http://*.rtfd.org`` for links in
  the documentation. (:issue:`3092`)

- Improve readability (wording, grammar) of Getting Started guide (:issue:`3131`)

- Added note that calling pytest.main multiple times from the same process is
  not recommended because of import caching. (:issue:`3143`)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Show a simple and easy error when keyword expressions trigger a syntax error
  (for example, ``"-k foo and import"`` will show an error that you cannot use
  the ``import`` keyword in expressions). (:issue:`2953`)

- Change parametrized automatic test id generation to use the ``__name__``
  attribute of functions instead of the fallback argument name plus counter.
  (:issue:`2976`)

- Replace py.std with stdlib imports. (:issue:`3067`)

- Corrected 'you' to 'your' in logging docs. (:issue:`3129`)


pytest 3.3.2 (2017-12-25)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- pytester: ignore files used to obtain current user metadata in the fd leak
  detector. (:issue:`2784`)

- Fix **memory leak** where objects returned by fixtures were never destructed
  by the garbage collector. (:issue:`2981`)

- Fix conversion of pyargs to filename to not convert symlinks on Python 2. (:issue:`2985`)

- ``PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE`` is now checked for plugins too rather than only for
  test modules. (:issue:`2995`)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Add clarifying note about behavior of multiple parametrized arguments (:issue:`3001`)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Code cleanup. (:issue:`3015`,
  :issue:`3021`)

- Clean up code by replacing imports and references of ``_ast`` to ``ast``.
  (:issue:`3018`)


pytest 3.3.1 (2017-12-05)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix issue about ``-p no:<plugin>`` having no effect. (:issue:`2920`)

- Fix regression with warnings that contained non-strings in their arguments in
  Python 2. (:issue:`2956`)

- Always escape null bytes when setting ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST``. (:issue:`2957`)

- Fix ``ZeroDivisionError`` when using the ``testmon`` plugin when no tests
  were actually collected. (:issue:`2971`)

- Bring back ``TerminalReporter.writer`` as an alias to
  ``TerminalReporter._tw``. This alias was removed by accident in the ``3.3.0``
  release. (:issue:`2984`)

- The ``pytest-capturelog`` plugin is now also blacklisted, avoiding errors when
  running pytest with it still installed. (:issue:`3004`)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Fix broken link to plugin ``pytest-localserver``. (:issue:`2963`)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Update github "bugs" link in ``CONTRIBUTING.rst`` (:issue:`2949`)


pytest 3.3.0 (2017-11-23)
=========================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- pytest no longer supports Python **2.6** and **3.3**. Those Python versions
  are EOL for some time now and incur maintenance and compatibility costs on
  the pytest core team, and following up with the rest of the community we
  decided that they will no longer be supported starting on this version. Users
  which still require those versions should pin pytest to ``<3.3``. (:issue:`2812`)

- Remove internal ``_preloadplugins()`` function. This removal is part of the
  ``pytest_namespace()`` hook deprecation. (:issue:`2636`)

- Internally change ``CallSpec2`` to have a list of marks instead of a broken
  mapping of keywords. This removes the keywords attribute of the internal
  ``CallSpec2`` class. (:issue:`2672`)

- Remove ParameterSet.deprecated_arg_dict - its not a public api and the lack
  of the underscore was a naming error. (:issue:`2675`)

- Remove the internal multi-typed attribute ``Node._evalskip`` and replace it
  with the boolean ``Node._skipped_by_mark``. (:issue:`2767`)

- The ``params`` list passed to ``pytest.fixture`` is now for
  all effects considered immutable and frozen at the moment of the ``pytest.fixture``
  call. Previously the list could be changed before the first invocation of the fixture
  allowing for a form of dynamic parametrization (for example, updated from command-line options),
  but this was an unwanted implementation detail which complicated the internals and prevented
  some internal cleanup. See issue :issue:`2959`
  for details and a recommended workaround.

Features
--------

- ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hook can now receive a ``request``
  argument. (:issue:`2124`)

- Replace the old introspection code in compat.py that determines the available
  arguments of fixtures with inspect.signature on Python 3 and
  funcsigs.signature on Python 2. This should respect ``__signature__``
  declarations on functions. (:issue:`2267`)

- Report tests with global ``pytestmark`` variable only once. (:issue:`2549`)

- Now pytest displays the total progress percentage while running tests. The
  previous output style can be set by configuring the ``console_output_style``
  setting to ``classic``. (:issue:`2657`)

- Match ``warns`` signature to ``raises`` by adding ``match`` keyword. (:issue:`2708`)

- pytest now captures and displays output from the standard ``logging`` module.
  The user can control the logging level to be captured by specifying options
  in ``pytest.ini``, the command line and also during individual tests using
  markers. Also, a ``caplog`` fixture is available that enables users to test
  the captured log during specific tests (similar to ``capsys`` for example).
  For more information, please see the :doc:`logging docs <how-to/logging>`. This feature was
  introduced by merging the popular :pypi:`pytest-catchlog` plugin, thanks to :user:`thisch`.
  Be advised that during the merging the
  backward compatibility interface with the defunct ``pytest-capturelog`` has
  been dropped. (:issue:`2794`)

- Add ``allow_module_level`` kwarg to ``pytest.skip()``, enabling to skip the
  whole module. (:issue:`2808`)

- Allow setting ``file_or_dir``, ``-c``, and ``-o`` in PYTEST_ADDOPTS. (:issue:`2824`)

- Return stdout/stderr capture results as a ``namedtuple``, so ``out`` and
  ``err`` can be accessed by attribute. (:issue:`2879`)

- Add ``capfdbinary``, a version of ``capfd`` which returns bytes from
  ``readouterr()``. (:issue:`2923`)

- Add ``capsysbinary`` a version of ``capsys`` which returns bytes from
  ``readouterr()``. (:issue:`2934`)

- Implement feature to skip ``setup.py`` files when run with
  ``--doctest-modules``. (:issue:`502`)


Bug Fixes
---------

- Resume output capturing after ``capsys/capfd.disabled()`` context manager.
  (:issue:`1993`)

- ``pytest_fixture_setup`` and ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hooks are now
  called for all ``conftest.py`` files. (:issue:`2124`)

- If an exception happens while loading a plugin, pytest no longer hides the
  original traceback. In Python 2 it will show the original traceback with a new
  message that explains in which plugin. In Python 3 it will show 2 canonized
  exceptions, the original exception while loading the plugin in addition to an
  exception that pytest throws about loading a plugin. (:issue:`2491`)

- ``capsys`` and ``capfd`` can now be used by other fixtures. (:issue:`2709`)

- Internal ``pytester`` plugin properly encodes ``bytes`` arguments to
  ``utf-8``. (:issue:`2738`)

- ``testdir`` now uses use the same method used by ``tmpdir`` to create its
  temporary directory. This changes the final structure of the ``testdir``
  directory slightly, but should not affect usage in normal scenarios and
  avoids a number of potential problems. (:issue:`2751`)

- pytest no longer complains about warnings with unicode messages being
  non-ascii compatible even for ascii-compatible messages. As a result of this,
  warnings with unicode messages are converted first to an ascii representation
  for safety. (:issue:`2809`)

- Change return value of pytest command when ``--maxfail`` is reached from
  ``2`` (interrupted) to ``1`` (failed). (:issue:`2845`)

- Fix issue in assertion rewriting which could lead it to rewrite modules which
  should not be rewritten. (:issue:`2939`)

- Handle marks without description in ``pytest.ini``. (:issue:`2942`)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- pytest now depends on :pypi:`attrs` for internal
  structures to ease code maintainability. (:issue:`2641`)

- Refactored internal Python 2/3 compatibility code to use ``six``. (:issue:`2642`)

- Stop vendoring ``pluggy`` - we're missing out on its latest changes for not
  much benefit (:issue:`2719`)

- Internal refactor: simplify ascii string escaping by using the
  backslashreplace error handler in newer Python 3 versions. (:issue:`2734`)

- Remove unnecessary mark evaluator in unittest plugin (:issue:`2767`)

- Calls to ``Metafunc.addcall`` now emit a deprecation warning. This function
  is scheduled to be removed in ``pytest-4.0``. (:issue:`2876`)

- Internal move of the parameterset extraction to a more maintainable place.
  (:issue:`2877`)

- Internal refactoring to simplify scope node lookup. (:issue:`2910`)

- Configure ``pytest`` to prevent pip from installing pytest in unsupported
  Python versions. (:issue:`2922`)


pytest 3.2.5 (2017-11-15)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Remove ``py<1.5`` restriction from ``pytest`` as this can cause version
  conflicts in some installations. (:issue:`2926`)


pytest 3.2.4 (2017-11-13)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix the bug where running with ``--pyargs`` will result in items with
  empty ``parent.nodeid`` if run from a different root directory. (:issue:`2775`)

- Fix issue with ``@pytest.parametrize`` if argnames was specified as keyword arguments.
  (:issue:`2819`)

- Strip whitespace from marker names when reading them from INI config. (:issue:`2856`)

- Show full context of doctest source in the pytest output, if the line number of
  failed example in the docstring is < 9. (:issue:`2882`)

- Match fixture paths against actual path segments in order to avoid matching folders which share a prefix.
  (:issue:`2836`)

Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Introduce a dedicated section about conftest.py. (:issue:`1505`)

- Explicitly mention ``xpass`` in the documentation of ``xfail``. (:issue:`1997`)

- Append example for pytest.param in the example/parametrize document. (:issue:`2658`)

- Clarify language of proposal for fixtures parameters (:issue:`2893`)

- List python 3.6 in the documented supported versions in the getting started
  document. (:issue:`2903`)

- Clarify the documentation of available fixture scopes. (:issue:`538`)

- Add documentation about the ``python -m pytest`` invocation adding the
  current directory to sys.path. (:issue:`911`)


pytest 3.2.3 (2017-10-03)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix crash in tab completion when no prefix is given. (:issue:`2748`)

- The equality checking function (``__eq__``) of ``MarkDecorator`` returns
  ``False`` if one object is not an instance of ``MarkDecorator``. (:issue:`2758`)

- When running ``pytest --fixtures-per-test``: don't crash if an item has no
  _fixtureinfo attribute (e.g. doctests) (:issue:`2788`)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- In help text of ``-k`` option, add example of using ``not`` to not select
  certain tests whose names match the provided expression. (:issue:`1442`)

- Add note in ``parametrize.rst`` about calling ``metafunc.parametrize``
  multiple times. (:issue:`1548`)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Set ``xfail_strict=True`` in pytest's own test suite to catch expected
  failures as soon as they start to pass. (:issue:`2722`)

- Fix typo in example of passing a callable to markers (in example/markers.rst)
  (:issue:`2765`)


pytest 3.2.2 (2017-09-06)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Calling the deprecated ``request.getfuncargvalue()`` now shows the source of
  the call. (:issue:`2681`)

- Allow tests declared as ``@staticmethod`` to use fixtures. (:issue:`2699`)

- Fixed edge-case during collection: attributes which raised ``pytest.fail``
  when accessed would abort the entire collection. (:issue:`2707`)

- Fix ``ReprFuncArgs`` with mixed unicode and UTF-8 args. (:issue:`2731`)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- In examples on working with custom markers, add examples demonstrating the
  usage of ``pytest.mark.MARKER_NAME.with_args`` in comparison with
  ``pytest.mark.MARKER_NAME.__call__`` (:issue:`2604`)

- In one of the simple examples, use ``pytest_collection_modifyitems()`` to skip
  tests based on a command-line option, allowing its sharing while preventing a
  user error when accessing ``pytest.config`` before the argument parsing.
  (:issue:`2653`)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Fixed minor error in 'Good Practices/Manual Integration' code snippet.
  (:issue:`2691`)

- Fixed typo in goodpractices.rst. (:issue:`2721`)

- Improve user guidance regarding ``--resultlog`` deprecation. (:issue:`2739`)


pytest 3.2.1 (2017-08-08)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed small terminal glitch when collecting a single test item. (:issue:`2579`)

- Correctly consider ``/`` as the file separator to automatically mark plugin
  files for rewrite on Windows. (:issue:`2591`)

- Properly escape test names when setting ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` environment
  variable. (:issue:`2644`)

- Fix error on Windows and Python 3.6+ when ``sys.stdout`` has been replaced
  with a stream-like object which does not implement the full ``io`` module
  buffer protocol. In particular this affects ``pytest-xdist`` users on the
  aforementioned platform. (:issue:`2666`)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Explicitly document which pytest features work with ``unittest``. (:issue:`2626`)


pytest 3.2.0 (2017-07-30)
=========================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- ``pytest.approx`` no longer supports ``>``, ``>=``, ``<`` and ``<=``
  operators to avoid surprising/inconsistent behavior. See the :func:`~pytest.approx` docs for more
  information. (:issue:`2003`)

- All old-style specific behavior in current classes in the pytest's API is
  considered deprecated at this point and will be removed in a future release.
  This affects Python 2 users only and in rare situations. (:issue:`2147`)

- A deprecation warning is now raised when using marks for parameters
  in ``pytest.mark.parametrize``. Use ``pytest.param`` to apply marks to
  parameters instead. (:issue:`2427`)


Features
--------

- Add support for numpy arrays (and dicts) to approx. (:issue:`1994`)

- Now test function objects have a ``pytestmark`` attribute containing a list
  of marks applied directly to the test function, as opposed to marks inherited
  from parent classes or modules. (:issue:`2516`)

- Collection ignores local virtualenvs by default; ``--collect-in-virtualenv``
  overrides this behavior. (:issue:`2518`)

- Allow class methods decorated as ``@staticmethod`` to be candidates for
  collection as a test function. (Only for Python 2.7 and above. Python 2.6
  will still ignore static methods.) (:issue:`2528`)

- Introduce ``mark.with_args`` in order to allow passing functions/classes as
  sole argument to marks. (:issue:`2540`)

- New ``cache_dir`` ini option: sets the directory where the contents of the
  cache plugin are stored. Directory may be relative or absolute path: if relative path, then
  directory is created relative to ``rootdir``, otherwise it is used as is.
  Additionally path may contain environment variables which are expanded during
  runtime. (:issue:`2543`)

- Introduce the ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` environment variable that is set with
  the ``nodeid`` and stage (``setup``, ``call`` and ``teardown``) of the test
  being currently executed. See the :ref:`documentation <pytest current test env>`
  for more info. (:issue:`2583`)

- Introduced ``@pytest.mark.filterwarnings`` mark which allows overwriting the
  warnings filter on a per test, class or module level. See the :ref:`docs <filterwarnings>`
  for more information. (:issue:`2598`)

- ``--last-failed`` now remembers forever when a test has failed and only
  forgets it if it passes again. This makes it easy to fix a test suite by
  selectively running files and fixing tests incrementally. (:issue:`2621`)

- New ``pytest_report_collectionfinish`` hook which allows plugins to add
  messages to the terminal reporting after collection has been finished
  successfully. (:issue:`2622`)

- Added support for :pep:`415`\'s
  ``Exception.__suppress_context__``. Now if a ``raise exception from None`` is
  caught by pytest, pytest will no longer chain the context in the test report.
  The behavior now matches Python's traceback behavior. (:issue:`2631`)

- Exceptions raised by ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.skip`` and ``pytest.xfail``
  now subclass BaseException, making them harder to be caught unintentionally
  by normal code. (:issue:`580`)


Bug Fixes
---------

- Set ``stdin`` to a closed ``PIPE`` in ``pytester.py.Testdir.popen()`` for
  avoid unwanted interactive ``pdb`` (:issue:`2023`)

- Add missing ``encoding`` attribute to ``sys.std*`` streams when using
  ``capsys`` capture mode. (:issue:`2375`)

- Fix terminal color changing to black on Windows if ``colorama`` is imported
  in a ``conftest.py`` file. (:issue:`2510`)

- Fix line number when reporting summary of skipped tests. (:issue:`2548`)

- capture: ensure that EncodedFile.name is a string. (:issue:`2555`)

- The options ``--fixtures`` and ``--fixtures-per-test`` will now keep
  indentation within docstrings. (:issue:`2574`)

- doctests line numbers are now reported correctly, fixing `pytest-sugar#122
  <https://github.com/Frozenball/pytest-sugar/issues/122>`_. (:issue:`2610`)

- Fix non-determinism in order of fixture collection. Adds new dependency
  (ordereddict) for Python 2.6. (:issue:`920`)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Clarify ``pytest_configure`` hook call order. (:issue:`2539`)

- Extend documentation for testing plugin code with the ``pytester`` plugin.
  (:issue:`971`)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Update help message for ``--strict`` to make it clear it only deals with
  unregistered markers, not warnings. (:issue:`2444`)

- Internal code move: move code for pytest.approx/pytest.raises to own files in
  order to cut down the size of python.py (:issue:`2489`)

- Renamed the utility function ``_pytest.compat._escape_strings`` to
  ``_ascii_escaped`` to better communicate the function's purpose. (:issue:`2533`)

- Improve error message for CollectError with skip/skipif. (:issue:`2546`)

- Emit warning about ``yield`` tests being deprecated only once per generator.
  (:issue:`2562`)

- Ensure final collected line doesn't include artifacts of previous write.
  (:issue:`2571`)

- Fixed all flake8 errors and warnings. (:issue:`2581`)

- Added ``fix-lint`` tox environment to run automatic pep8 fixes on the code.
  (:issue:`2582`)

- Turn warnings into errors in pytest's own test suite in order to catch
  regressions due to deprecations more promptly. (:issue:`2588`)

- Show multiple issue links in CHANGELOG entries. (:issue:`2620`)


pytest 3.1.3 (2017-07-03)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix decode error in Python 2 for doctests in docstrings. (:issue:`2434`)

- Exceptions raised during teardown by finalizers are now suppressed until all
  finalizers are called, with the initial exception reraised. (:issue:`2440`)

- Fix incorrect "collected items" report when specifying tests on the command-
  line. (:issue:`2464`)

- ``deprecated_call`` in context-manager form now captures deprecation warnings
  even if the same warning has already been raised. Also, ``deprecated_call``
  will always produce the same error message (previously it would produce
  different messages in context-manager vs. function-call mode). (:issue:`2469`)

- Fix issue where paths collected by pytest could have triple leading ``/``
  characters. (:issue:`2475`)

- Fix internal error when trying to detect the start of a recursive traceback.
  (:issue:`2486`)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Explicitly state for which hooks the calls stop after the first non-None
  result. (:issue:`2493`)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Create invoke tasks for updating the vendored packages. (:issue:`2474`)

- Update copyright dates in LICENSE, README.rst and in the documentation.
  (:issue:`2499`)


pytest 3.1.2 (2017-06-08)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Required options added via ``pytest_addoption`` will no longer prevent using
  --help without passing them. (#1999)

- Respect ``python_files`` in assertion rewriting. (#2121)

- Fix recursion error detection when frames in the traceback contain objects
  that can't be compared (like ``numpy`` arrays). (#2459)

- ``UnicodeWarning`` is issued from the internal pytest warnings plugin only
  when the message contains non-ascii unicode (Python 2 only). (#2463)

- Added a workaround for Python 3.6 ``WindowsConsoleIO`` breaking due to Pytests's
  ``FDCapture``. Other code using console handles might still be affected by the
  very same issue and might require further workarounds/fixes, i.e. ``colorama``.
  (#2467)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Fix internal API links to ``pluggy`` objects. (#2331)

- Make it clear that ``pytest.xfail`` stops test execution at the calling point
  and improve overall flow of the ``skipping`` docs. (#810)


pytest 3.1.1 (2017-05-30)
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- pytest warning capture no longer overrides existing warning filters. The
  previous behaviour would override all filters and caused regressions in test
  suites which configure warning filters to match their needs. Note that as a
  side-effect of this is that ``DeprecationWarning`` and
  ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` are no longer shown by default. (#2430)

- Fix issue with non-ascii contents in doctest text files. (#2434)

- Fix encoding errors for unicode warnings in Python 2. (#2436)

- ``pytest.deprecated_call`` now captures ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` in
  context manager form. (#2441)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Addition of towncrier for changelog management. (#2390)


3.1.0 (2017-05-22)
==================


New Features
------------

* The ``pytest-warnings`` plugin has been integrated into the core and now ``pytest`` automatically
  captures and displays warnings at the end of the test session.

  .. warning::

    This feature may disrupt test suites which apply and treat warnings themselves, and can be
    disabled in your ``pytest.ini``:

    .. code-block:: ini

      [pytest]
      addopts = -p no:warnings

    See the :doc:`warnings documentation page <how-to/capture-warnings>` for more
    information.

  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Added ``junit_suite_name`` ini option to specify root ``<testsuite>`` name for JUnit XML reports (:issue:`533`).

* Added an ini option ``doctest_encoding`` to specify which encoding to use for doctest files.
  Thanks :user:`wheerd` for the PR (:pr:`2101`).

* ``pytest.warns`` now checks for subclass relationship rather than
  class equality. Thanks :user:`lesteve` for the PR (:pr:`2166`)

* ``pytest.raises`` now asserts that the error message matches a text or regex
  with the ``match`` keyword argument. Thanks :user:`Kriechi` for the PR.

* ``pytest.param`` can be used to declare test parameter sets with marks and test ids.
  Thanks :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for the PR.


Changes
-------

* remove all internal uses of pytest_namespace hooks,
  this is to prepare the removal of preloadconfig in pytest 4.0
  Thanks to :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for the PR.

* pytest now warns when a callable ids raises in a parametrized test. Thanks :user:`fogo` for the PR.

* It is now possible to skip test classes from being collected by setting a
  ``__test__`` attribute to ``False`` in the class body (:issue:`2007`). Thanks
  to :user:`syre` for the report and :user:`lwm` for the PR.

* Change junitxml.py to produce reports that comply with Junitxml schema.
  If the same test fails with failure in call and then errors in teardown
  we split testcase element into two, one containing the error and the other
  the failure. (:issue:`2228`) Thanks to :user:`kkoukiou` for the PR.

* Testcase reports with a ``url`` attribute will now properly write this to junitxml.
  Thanks :user:`fushi` for the PR (:pr:`1874`).

* Remove common items from dict comparison output when verbosity=1. Also update
  the truncation message to make it clearer that pytest truncates all
  assertion messages if verbosity < 2 (:issue:`1512`).
  Thanks :user:`mattduck` for the PR

* ``--pdbcls`` no longer implies ``--pdb``. This makes it possible to use
  ``addopts=--pdbcls=module.SomeClass`` on ``pytest.ini``. Thanks :user:`davidszotten` for
  the PR (:pr:`1952`).

* fix :issue:`2013`: turn RecordedWarning into ``namedtuple``,
  to give it a comprehensible repr while preventing unwarranted modification.

* fix :issue:`2208`: ensure an iteration limit for ``_pytest.compat.get_real_func``.
  Thanks :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for the report and PR.

* Hooks are now verified after collection is complete, rather than right after loading installed plugins. This
  makes it easy to write hooks for plugins which will be loaded during collection, for example using the
  ``pytest_plugins`` special variable (:issue:`1821`).
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Modify ``pytest_make_parametrize_id()`` hook to accept ``argname`` as an
  additional parameter.
  Thanks :user:`unsignedint` for the PR.

* Add ``venv`` to the default ``norecursedirs`` setting.
  Thanks :user:`The-Compiler` for the PR.

* ``PluginManager.import_plugin`` now accepts unicode plugin names in Python 2.
  Thanks :user:`reutsharabani` for the PR.

* fix :issue:`2308`: When using both ``--lf`` and ``--ff``, only the last failed tests are run.
  Thanks :user:`ojii` for the PR.

* Replace minor/patch level version numbers in the documentation with placeholders.
  This significantly reduces change-noise as different contributors regenerate
  the documentation on different platforms.
  Thanks :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for the PR.

* fix :issue:`2391`: consider pytest_plugins on all plugin modules
  Thanks :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for the PR.


Bug Fixes
---------

* Fix ``AttributeError`` on ``sys.stdout.buffer`` / ``sys.stderr.buffer``
  while using ``capsys`` fixture in python 3. (:issue:`1407`).
  Thanks to :user:`asottile`.

* Change capture.py's ``DontReadFromInput`` class to throw ``io.UnsupportedOperation`` errors rather
  than ValueErrors in the ``fileno`` method (:issue:`2276`).
  Thanks :user:`metasyn` and :user:`vlad-dragos` for the PR.

* Fix exception formatting while importing modules when the exception message
  contains non-ascii characters (:issue:`2336`).
  Thanks :user:`fabioz` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Added documentation related to issue (:issue:`1937`)
  Thanks :user:`skylarjhdownes` for the PR.

* Allow collecting files with any file extension as Python modules (:issue:`2369`).
  Thanks :user:`Kodiologist` for the PR.

* Show the correct error message when collect "parametrize" func with wrong args (:issue:`2383`).
  Thanks :user:`The-Compiler` for the report and :user:`robin0371` for the PR.


3.0.7 (2017-03-14)
==================


* Fix issue in assertion rewriting breaking due to modules silently discarding
  other modules when importing fails
  Notably, importing the ``anydbm`` module is fixed. (:issue:`2248`).
  Thanks :user:`pfhayes` for the PR.

* junitxml: Fix problematic case where system-out tag occurred twice per testcase
  element in the XML report. Thanks :user:`kkoukiou` for the PR.

* Fix regression, pytest now skips unittest correctly if run with ``--pdb``
  (:issue:`2137`). Thanks to :user:`gst` for the report and :user:`mbyt` for the PR.

* Ignore exceptions raised from descriptors (e.g. properties) during Python test collection (:issue:`2234`).
  Thanks to :user:`bluetech`.

* ``--override-ini`` now correctly overrides some fundamental options like ``python_files`` (:issue:`2238`).
  Thanks :user:`sirex` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Replace ``raise StopIteration`` usages in the code by simple ``returns`` to finish generators, in accordance to :pep:`479` (:issue:`2160`).
  Thanks to :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Fix internal errors when an unprintable ``AssertionError`` is raised inside a test.
  Thanks :user:`omerhadari` for the PR.

* Skipping plugin now also works with test items generated by custom collectors (:issue:`2231`).
  Thanks to :user:`vidartf`.

* Fix trailing whitespace in console output if no .ini file presented (:issue:`2281`). Thanks :user:`fbjorn` for the PR.

* Conditionless ``xfail`` markers no longer rely on the underlying test item
  being an instance of ``PyobjMixin``, and can therefore apply to tests not
  collected by the built-in python test collector. Thanks :user:`barneygale` for the
  PR.


3.0.6 (2017-01-22)
==================

* pytest no longer generates ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` from its own operations, which was introduced by mistake in version ``3.0.5`` (:issue:`2118`).
  Thanks to :user:`nicoddemus` for the report and :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for the PR.


* pytest no longer recognizes coroutine functions as yield tests (:issue:`2129`).
  Thanks to :user:`malinoff` for the PR.

* Plugins loaded by the ``PYTEST_PLUGINS`` environment variable are now automatically
  considered for assertion rewriting (:issue:`2185`).
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Improve error message when pytest.warns fails (:issue:`2150`). The type(s) of the
  expected warnings and the list of caught warnings is added to the
  error message. Thanks :user:`lesteve` for the PR.

* Fix ``pytester`` internal plugin to work correctly with latest versions of
  ``zope.interface`` (:issue:`1989`). Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Assert statements of the ``pytester`` plugin again benefit from assertion rewriting (:issue:`1920`).
  Thanks :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Specifying tests with colons like ``test_foo.py::test_bar`` for tests in
  subdirectories with ini configuration files now uses the correct ini file
  (:issue:`2148`).  Thanks :user:`pelme`.

* Fail ``testdir.runpytest().assert_outcomes()`` explicitly if the pytest
  terminal output it relies on is missing. Thanks to :user:`eli-b` for the PR.


3.0.5 (2016-12-05)
==================

* Add warning when not passing ``option=value`` correctly to ``-o/--override-ini`` (:issue:`2105`).
  Also improved the help documentation. Thanks to :user:`mbukatov` for the report and
  :user:`lwm` for the PR.

* Now ``--confcutdir`` and ``--junit-xml`` are properly validated if they are directories
  and filenames, respectively (:issue:`2089` and :issue:`2078`). Thanks to :user:`lwm` for the PR.

* Add hint to error message hinting possible missing ``__init__.py`` (:issue:`478`). Thanks :user:`DuncanBetts`.

* More accurately describe when fixture finalization occurs in documentation (:issue:`687`). Thanks :user:`DuncanBetts`.

* Provide ``:ref:`` targets for ``recwarn.rst`` so we can use intersphinx referencing.
  Thanks to :user:`dupuy` for the report and :user:`lwm` for the PR.

* In Python 2, use a simple ``+-`` ASCII string in the string representation of ``pytest.approx`` (for example ``"4 +- 4.0e-06"``)
  because it is brittle to handle that in different contexts and representations internally in pytest
  which can result in bugs such as :issue:`2111`. In Python 3, the representation still uses ``±`` (for example ``4 ± 4.0e-06``).
  Thanks :user:`kerrick-lyft` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Using ``item.Function``, ``item.Module``, etc., is now issuing deprecation warnings, prefer
  ``pytest.Function``, ``pytest.Module``, etc., instead (:issue:`2034`).
  Thanks :user:`nmundar` for the PR.

* Fix error message using ``approx`` with complex numbers (:issue:`2082`).
  Thanks :user:`adler-j` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Fixed false-positives warnings from assertion rewrite hook for modules imported more than
  once by the ``pytest_plugins`` mechanism.
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Remove an internal cache which could cause hooks from ``conftest.py`` files in
  sub-directories to be called in other directories incorrectly (:issue:`2016`).
  Thanks :user:`d-b-w` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Remove internal code meant to support earlier Python 3 versions that produced the side effect
  of leaving ``None`` in ``sys.modules`` when expressions were evaluated by pytest (for example passing a condition
  as a string to ``pytest.mark.skipif``)(:issue:`2103`).
  Thanks :user:`jaraco` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Cope gracefully with a .pyc file with no matching .py file (:issue:`2038`). Thanks
  :user:`nedbat`.


3.0.4 (2016-11-09)
==================

* Import errors when collecting test modules now display the full traceback (:issue:`1976`).
  Thanks :user:`cwitty` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Fix confusing command-line help message for custom options with two or more ``metavar`` properties (:issue:`2004`).
  Thanks :user:`okulynyak` and :user:`davehunt` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* When loading plugins, import errors which contain non-ascii messages are now properly handled in Python 2 (:issue:`1998`).
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Fixed cyclic reference when ``pytest.raises`` is used in context-manager form (:issue:`1965`). Also as a
  result of this fix, ``sys.exc_info()`` is left empty in both context-manager and function call usages.
  Previously, ``sys.exc_info`` would contain the exception caught by the context manager,
  even when the expected exception occurred.
  Thanks :user:`MSeifert04` for the report and the PR.

* Fixed false-positives warnings from assertion rewrite hook for modules that were rewritten but
  were later marked explicitly by ``pytest.register_assert_rewrite``
  or implicitly as a plugin (:issue:`2005`).
  Thanks :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Report teardown output on test failure (:issue:`442`).
  Thanks :user:`matclab` for the PR.

* Fix teardown error message in generated xUnit XML.
  Thanks :user:`gdyuldin` for the PR.

* Properly handle exceptions in ``multiprocessing`` tasks (:issue:`1984`).
  Thanks :user:`adborden` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Clean up unittest TestCase objects after tests are complete (:issue:`1649`).
  Thanks :user:`d-b-w` for the report and PR.


3.0.3 (2016-09-28)
==================

* The ``ids`` argument to ``parametrize`` again accepts ``unicode`` strings
  in Python 2 (:issue:`1905`).
  Thanks :user:`philpep` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Assertions are now being rewritten for plugins in development mode
  (``pip install -e``) (:issue:`1934`).
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Fix pkg_resources import error in Jython projects (:issue:`1853`).
  Thanks :user:`raquelalegre` for the PR.

* Got rid of ``AttributeError: 'Module' object has no attribute '_obj'`` exception
  in Python 3 (:issue:`1944`).
  Thanks :user:`axil` for the PR.

* Explain a bad scope value passed to ``@fixture`` declarations or
  a ``MetaFunc.parametrize()`` call.

* This version includes ``pluggy-0.4.0``, which correctly handles
  ``VersionConflict`` errors in plugins (:issue:`704`).
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.


3.0.2 (2016-09-01)
==================

* Improve error message when passing non-string ids to ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` (:issue:`1857`).
  Thanks :user:`okken` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Add ``buffer`` attribute to stdin stub class ``pytest.capture.DontReadFromInput``
  Thanks :user:`joguSD` for the PR.

* Fix ``UnicodeEncodeError`` when string comparison with unicode has failed. (:issue:`1864`)
  Thanks :user:`AiOO` for the PR.

* ``pytest_plugins`` is now handled correctly if defined as a string (as opposed as
  a sequence of strings) when modules are considered for assertion rewriting.
  Due to this bug, much more modules were being rewritten than necessary
  if a test suite uses ``pytest_plugins`` to load internal plugins (:issue:`1888`).
  Thanks :user:`jaraco` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR (:pr:`1891`).

* Do not call tearDown and cleanups when running tests from
  ``unittest.TestCase`` subclasses with ``--pdb``
  enabled. This allows proper post mortem debugging for all applications
  which have significant logic in their tearDown machinery (:issue:`1890`). Thanks
  :user:`mbyt` for the PR.

* Fix use of deprecated ``getfuncargvalue`` method in the internal doctest plugin.
  Thanks :user:`ViviCoder` for the report (:issue:`1898`).


3.0.1 (2016-08-23)
==================

* Fix regression when ``importorskip`` is used at module level (:issue:`1822`).
  Thanks :user:`jaraco` and :user:`The-Compiler` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Fix parametrization scope when session fixtures are used in conjunction
  with normal parameters in the same call (:issue:`1832`).
  Thanks :user:`The-Compiler` for the report, :user:`Kingdread` and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Fix internal error when parametrizing tests or fixtures using an empty ``ids`` argument (:issue:`1849`).
  Thanks :user:`OPpuolitaival` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Fix loader error when running ``pytest`` embedded in a zipfile.
  Thanks :user:`mbachry` for the PR.


.. _release-3.0.0:

3.0.0 (2016-08-18)
==================

**Incompatible changes**


A number of incompatible changes were made in this release, with the intent of removing features deprecated for a long
time or change existing behaviors in order to make them less surprising/more useful.

* Reinterpretation mode has now been removed.  Only plain and rewrite
  mode are available, consequently the ``--assert=reinterp`` option is
  no longer available.  This also means files imported from plugins or
  ``conftest.py`` will not benefit from improved assertions by
  default, you should use ``pytest.register_assert_rewrite()`` to
  explicitly turn on assertion rewriting for those files.  Thanks
  :user:`flub` for the PR.

* The following deprecated commandline options were removed:

  * ``--genscript``: no longer supported;
  * ``--no-assert``: use ``--assert=plain`` instead;
  * ``--nomagic``: use ``--assert=plain`` instead;
  * ``--report``: use ``-r`` instead;

  Thanks to :user:`RedBeardCode` for the PR (:pr:`1664`).

* ImportErrors in plugins now are a fatal error instead of issuing a
  pytest warning (:issue:`1479`). Thanks to :user:`The-Compiler` for the PR.

* Removed support code for Python 3 versions < 3.3 (:pr:`1627`).

* Removed all ``py.test-X*`` entry points. The versioned, suffixed entry points
  were never documented and a leftover from a pre-virtualenv era. These entry
  points also created broken entry points in wheels, so removing them also
  removes a source of confusion for users (:issue:`1632`).
  Thanks :user:`obestwalter` for the PR.

* ``pytest.skip()`` now raises an error when used to decorate a test function,
  as opposed to its original intent (to imperatively skip a test inside a test function). Previously
  this usage would cause the entire module to be skipped (:issue:`607`).
  Thanks :user:`omarkohl` for the complete PR (:pr:`1519`).

* Exit tests if a collection error occurs. A poll indicated most users will hit CTRL-C
  anyway as soon as they see collection errors, so pytest might as well make that the default behavior (:issue:`1421`).
  A ``--continue-on-collection-errors`` option has been added to restore the previous behaviour.
  Thanks :user:`olegpidsadnyi` and :user:`omarkohl` for the complete PR (:pr:`1628`).

* Renamed the pytest ``pdb`` module (plugin) into ``debugging`` to avoid clashes with the builtin ``pdb`` module.

* Raise a helpful failure message when requesting a parametrized fixture at runtime,
  e.g. with ``request.getfixturevalue``. Previously these parameters were simply
  never defined, so a fixture decorated like ``@pytest.fixture(params=[0, 1, 2])``
  only ran once (:pr:`460`).
  Thanks to :user:`nikratio` for the bug report, :user:`RedBeardCode` and :user:`tomviner` for the PR.

* ``_pytest.monkeypatch.monkeypatch`` class has been renamed to ``_pytest.monkeypatch.MonkeyPatch``
  so it doesn't conflict with the ``monkeypatch`` fixture.

* ``--exitfirst / -x`` can now be overridden by a following ``--maxfail=N``
  and is just a synonym for ``--maxfail=1``.


**New Features**

* Support nose-style ``__test__`` attribute on methods of classes,
  including unittest-style Classes. If set to ``False``, the test will not be
  collected.

* New ``doctest_namespace`` fixture for injecting names into the
  namespace in which doctests run.
  Thanks :user:`milliams` for the complete PR (:pr:`1428`).

* New ``--doctest-report`` option available to change the output format of diffs
  when running (failing) doctests (implements :issue:`1749`).
  Thanks :user:`hartym` for the PR.

* New ``name`` argument to ``pytest.fixture`` decorator which allows a custom name
  for a fixture (to solve the funcarg-shadowing-fixture problem).
  Thanks :user:`novas0x2a` for the complete PR (:pr:`1444`).

* New ``approx()`` function for easily comparing floating-point numbers in
  tests.
  Thanks :user:`kalekundert` for the complete PR (:pr:`1441`).

* Ability to add global properties in the final xunit output file by accessing
  the internal ``junitxml`` plugin (experimental).
  Thanks :user:`tareqalayan` for the complete PR :pr:`1454`).

* New ``ExceptionInfo.match()`` method to match a regular expression on the
  string representation of an exception (:issue:`372`).
  Thanks :user:`omarkohl` for the complete PR (:pr:`1502`).

* ``__tracebackhide__`` can now also be set to a callable which then can decide
  whether to filter the traceback based on the ``ExceptionInfo`` object passed
  to it. Thanks :user:`The-Compiler` for the complete PR (:pr:`1526`).

* New ``pytest_make_parametrize_id(config, val)`` hook which can be used by plugins to provide
  friendly strings for custom types.
  Thanks :user:`palaviv` for the PR.

* ``capsys`` and ``capfd`` now have a ``disabled()`` context-manager method, which
  can be used to temporarily disable capture within a test.
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* New cli flag ``--fixtures-per-test``: shows which fixtures are being used
  for each selected test item. Features doc strings of fixtures by default.
  Can also show where fixtures are defined if combined with ``-v``.
  Thanks :user:`hackebrot` for the PR.

* Introduce ``pytest`` command as recommended entry point. Note that ``py.test``
  still works and is not scheduled for removal. Closes proposal
  :issue:`1629`. Thanks :user:`obestwalter` and :user:`davehunt` for the complete PR
  (:pr:`1633`).

* New cli flags:

  + ``--setup-plan``: performs normal collection and reports
    the potential setup and teardown and does not execute any fixtures and tests;
  + ``--setup-only``: performs normal collection, executes setup and teardown of
    fixtures and reports them;
  + ``--setup-show``: performs normal test execution and additionally shows
    setup and teardown of fixtures;
  + ``--keep-duplicates``: py.test now ignores duplicated paths given in the command
    line. To retain the previous behavior where the same test could be run multiple
    times by specifying it in the command-line multiple times, pass the ``--keep-duplicates``
    argument (:issue:`1609`);

  Thanks :user:`d6e`, :user:`kvas-it`, :user:`sallner`, :user:`ioggstream` and :user:`omarkohl` for the PRs.

* New CLI flag ``--override-ini``/``-o``: overrides values from the ini file.
  For example: ``"-o xfail_strict=True"``'.
  Thanks :user:`blueyed` and :user:`fengxx` for the PR.

* New hooks:

  + ``pytest_fixture_setup(fixturedef, request)``: executes fixture setup;
  + ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer(fixturedef)``: called after the fixture's
    finalizer and has access to the fixture's result cache.

  Thanks :user:`d6e`, :user:`sallner`.

* Issue warnings for asserts whose test is a tuple literal. Such asserts will
  never fail because tuples are always truthy and are usually a mistake
  (see :issue:`1562`). Thanks :user:`kvas-it`, for the PR.

* Allow passing a custom debugger class (e.g. ``--pdbcls=IPython.core.debugger:Pdb``).
  Thanks to :user:`anntzer` for the PR.


**Changes**

* Plugins now benefit from assertion rewriting.  Thanks
  :user:`sober7`, :user:`nicoddemus` and :user:`flub` for the PR.

* Change ``report.outcome`` for ``xpassed`` tests to ``"passed"`` in non-strict
  mode and ``"failed"`` in strict mode. Thanks to :user:`hackebrot` for the PR
  (:pr:`1795`) and :user:`gprasad84` for report (:issue:`1546`).

* Tests marked with ``xfail(strict=False)`` (the default) now appear in
  JUnitXML reports as passing tests instead of skipped.
  Thanks to :user:`hackebrot` for the PR (:pr:`1795`).

* Highlight path of the file location in the error report to make it easier to copy/paste.
  Thanks :user:`suzaku` for the PR (:pr:`1778`).

* Fixtures marked with ``@pytest.fixture`` can now use ``yield`` statements exactly like
  those marked with the ``@pytest.yield_fixture`` decorator. This change renders
  ``@pytest.yield_fixture`` deprecated and makes ``@pytest.fixture`` with ``yield`` statements
  the preferred way to write teardown code (:pr:`1461`).
  Thanks :user:`csaftoiu` for bringing this to attention and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Explicitly passed parametrize ids do not get escaped to ascii (:issue:`1351`).
  Thanks :user:`ceridwen` for the PR.

* Fixtures are now sorted in the error message displayed when an unknown
  fixture is declared in a test function.
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* ``pytest_terminal_summary`` hook now receives the ``exitstatus``
  of the test session as argument. Thanks :user:`blueyed` for the PR (:pr:`1809`).

* Parametrize ids can accept ``None`` as specific test id, in which case the
  automatically generated id for that argument will be used.
  Thanks :user:`palaviv` for the complete PR (:pr:`1468`).

* The parameter to xunit-style setup/teardown methods (``setup_method``,
  ``setup_module``, etc.) is now optional and may be omitted.
  Thanks :user:`okken` for bringing this to attention and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Improved automatic id generation selection in case of duplicate ids in
  parametrize.
  Thanks :user:`palaviv` for the complete PR (:pr:`1474`).

* Now pytest warnings summary is shown up by default. Added a new flag
  ``--disable-pytest-warnings`` to explicitly disable the warnings summary (:issue:`1668`).

* Make ImportError during collection more explicit by reminding
  the user to check the name of the test module/package(s) (:issue:`1426`).
  Thanks :user:`omarkohl` for the complete PR (:pr:`1520`).

* Add ``build/`` and ``dist/`` to the default ``--norecursedirs`` list. Thanks
  :user:`mikofski` for the report and :user:`tomviner` for the PR (:issue:`1544`).

* ``pytest.raises`` in the context manager form accepts a custom
  ``message`` to raise when no exception occurred.
  Thanks :user:`palaviv` for the complete PR (:pr:`1616`).

* ``conftest.py`` files now benefit from assertion rewriting; previously it
  was only available for test modules. Thanks :user:`flub`, :user:`sober7` and
  :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR (:issue:`1619`).

* Text documents without any doctests no longer appear as "skipped".
  Thanks :user:`graingert` for reporting and providing a full PR (:pr:`1580`).

* Ensure that a module within a namespace package can be found when it
  is specified on the command line together with the ``--pyargs``
  option.  Thanks to :user:`taschini` for the PR (:pr:`1597`).

* Always include full assertion explanation during assertion rewriting. The previous behaviour was hiding
  sub-expressions that happened to be ``False``, assuming this was redundant information.
  Thanks :user:`bagerard` for reporting (:issue:`1503`). Thanks to :user:`davehunt` and
  :user:`tomviner` for the PR.

* ``OptionGroup.addoption()`` now checks if option names were already
  added before, to make it easier to track down issues like :issue:`1618`.
  Before, you only got exceptions later from ``argparse`` library,
  giving no clue about the actual reason for double-added options.

* ``yield``-based tests are considered deprecated and will be removed in pytest-4.0.
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* ``[pytest]`` sections in ``setup.cfg`` files should now be named ``[tool:pytest]``
  to avoid conflicts with other distutils commands (see :pr:`567`). ``[pytest]`` sections in
  ``pytest.ini`` or ``tox.ini`` files are supported and unchanged.
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Using ``pytest_funcarg__`` prefix to declare fixtures is considered deprecated and will be
  removed in pytest-4.0 (:pr:`1684`).
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Passing a command-line string to ``pytest.main()`` is considered deprecated and scheduled
  for removal in pytest-4.0. It is recommended to pass a list of arguments instead (:pr:`1723`).

* Rename ``getfuncargvalue`` to ``getfixturevalue``. ``getfuncargvalue`` is
  still present but is now considered deprecated. Thanks to :user:`RedBeardCode` and :user:`tomviner`
  for the PR (:pr:`1626`).

* ``optparse`` type usage now triggers DeprecationWarnings (:issue:`1740`).


* ``optparse`` backward compatibility supports float/complex types (:issue:`457`).

* Refined logic for determining the ``rootdir``, considering only valid
  paths which fixes a number of issues: :issue:`1594`, :issue:`1435` and :issue:`1471`.
  Updated the documentation according to current behavior. Thanks to
  :user:`blueyed`, :user:`davehunt` and :user:`matthiasha` for the PR.

* Always include full assertion explanation. The previous behaviour was hiding
  sub-expressions that happened to be False, assuming this was redundant information.
  Thanks :user:`bagerard` for reporting (:issue:`1503`). Thanks to :user:`davehunt` and
  :user:`tomviner` for PR.

* Better message in case of not using parametrized variable (see :issue:`1539`).
  Thanks to :user:`tramwaj29` for the PR.

* Updated docstrings with a more uniform style.

* Add stderr write for ``pytest.exit(msg)`` during startup. Previously the message was never shown.
  Thanks :user:`BeyondEvil` for reporting :issue:`1210`. Thanks to @jgsonesen and
  :user:`tomviner` for the PR.

* No longer display the incorrect test deselection reason (:issue:`1372`).
  Thanks :user:`ronnypfannschmidt` for the PR.

* The ``--resultlog`` command line option has been deprecated: it is little used
  and there are more modern and better alternatives (see :issue:`830`).
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Improve error message with fixture lookup errors: add an 'E' to the first
  line and '>' to the rest. Fixes :issue:`717`. Thanks :user:`blueyed` for reporting and
  a PR, :user:`eolo999` for the initial PR and :user:`tomviner` for his guidance during
  EuroPython2016 sprint.


**Bug Fixes**

* Parametrize now correctly handles duplicated test ids.

* Fix internal error issue when the ``method`` argument is missing for
  ``teardown_method()`` (:issue:`1605`).

  Thanks :user:`Vogtinator` for reporting and :user:`RedBeardCode` and
  :user:`tomviner` for the PR.

  identify bugs in ``conftest.py`` files (:pr:`1516`). Thanks :user:`txomon` for
  the PR.

* Text documents without any doctests no longer appear as "skipped".
  Thanks :user:`graingert` for reporting and providing a full PR (:pr:`1580`).

* Fixed collection of classes with custom ``__new__`` method.

  in ``pytest.main("-c your_absolute_path")``.

* Fix maximum recursion depth detection when raised error class is not aware
  of unicode/encoded bytes.
  Thanks :user:`prusse-martin` for the PR (:pr:`1506`).

* Fix ``pytest.mark.skip`` mark when used in strict mode.
  Thanks :user:`pquentin` for the PR and :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for
  showing how to fix the bug.

* Minor improvements and fixes to the documentation.
  Thanks :user:`omarkohl` for the PR.

* Fix ``--fixtures`` to show all fixture definitions as opposed to just
  one per fixture name.
  Thanks to :user:`hackebrot` for the PR.


2.9.1 (2016-03-17)
==================

**Bug Fixes**

* Improve error message when a plugin fails to load.
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Fix (:issue:`1178`):
  ``pytest.fail`` with non-ascii characters raises an internal pytest error.
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Fix (:issue:`469`): junit parses report.nodeid incorrectly, when params IDs
  contain ``::``. Thanks :user:`tomviner` for the PR (:pr:`1431`).

* Fix (:issue:`578`): SyntaxErrors
  containing non-ascii lines at the point of failure generated an internal
  py.test error.
  Thanks :user:`asottile` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Fix (:issue:`1437`): When passing in a bytestring regex pattern to parameterize
  attempt to decode it as utf-8 ignoring errors.

* Fix (:issue:`649`): parametrized test nodes cannot be specified to run on the command line.

* Fix (:issue:`138`): better reporting for python 3.3+ chained exceptions


2.9.0 (2016-02-29)
==================

**New Features**

* New ``pytest.mark.skip`` mark, which unconditionally skips marked tests.
  Thanks :user:`MichaelAquilina` for the complete PR (:pr:`1040`).

* ``--doctest-glob`` may now be passed multiple times in the command-line.
  Thanks :user:`jab` and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* New ``-rp`` and ``-rP`` reporting options give the summary and full output
  of passing tests, respectively. Thanks to :user:`codewarrior0` for the PR.

* ``pytest.mark.xfail`` now has a ``strict`` option, which makes ``XPASS``
  tests to fail the test suite (defaulting to ``False``). There's also a
  ``xfail_strict`` ini option that can be used to configure it project-wise.
  Thanks :user:`rabbbit` for the request and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR (:pr:`1355`).

* ``Parser.addini`` now supports options of type ``bool``.
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* New ``ALLOW_BYTES`` doctest option. This strips ``b`` prefixes from byte strings
  in doctest output (similar to ``ALLOW_UNICODE``).
  Thanks :user:`jaraco` for the request and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR (:pr:`1287`).

* Give a hint on ``KeyboardInterrupt`` to use the ``--fulltrace`` option to show the errors.
  Fixes :issue:`1366`.
  Thanks to :user:`hpk42` for the report and :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for the PR.

* Catch ``IndexError`` exceptions when getting exception source location.
  Fixes a pytest internal error for dynamically generated code (fixtures and tests)
  where source lines are fake by intention.

**Changes**

* **Important**: `py.code <https://pylib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code.html>`_ has been
  merged into the ``pytest`` repository as ``pytest._code``. This decision
  was made because ``py.code`` had very few uses outside ``pytest`` and the
  fact that it was in a different repository made it difficult to fix bugs on
  its code in a timely manner. The team hopes with this to be able to better
  refactor out and improve that code.
  This change shouldn't affect users, but it is useful to let users aware
  if they encounter any strange behavior.

  Keep in mind that the code for ``pytest._code`` is **private** and
  **experimental**, so you definitely should not import it explicitly!

  Please note that the original ``py.code`` is still available in
  `pylib <https://pylib.readthedocs.io>`_.

* ``pytest_enter_pdb`` now optionally receives the pytest config object.
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.

* Removed code and documentation for Python 2.5 or lower versions,
  including removal of the obsolete ``_pytest.assertion.oldinterpret`` module.
  Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR (:pr:`1226`).

* Comparisons now always show up in full when ``CI`` or ``BUILD_NUMBER`` is
  found in the environment, even when ``-vv`` isn't used.
  Thanks :user:`The-Compiler` for the PR.

* ``--lf`` and ``--ff`` now support long names: ``--last-failed`` and
  ``--failed-first`` respectively.
  Thanks :user:`MichaelAquilina` for the PR.

* Added expected exceptions to ``pytest.raises`` fail message.

* Collection only displays progress ("collecting X items") when in a terminal.
  This avoids cluttering the output when using ``--color=yes`` to obtain
  colors in CI integrations systems (:issue:`1397`).

**Bug Fixes**

* The ``-s`` and ``-c`` options should now work under ``xdist``;
  ``Config.fromdictargs`` now represents its input much more faithfully.
  Thanks to :user:`bukzor` for the complete PR (:issue:`680`).

* Fix (:issue:`1290`): support Python 3.5's ``@`` operator in assertion rewriting.
  Thanks :user:`Shinkenjoe` for report with test case and :user:`tomviner` for the PR.

* Fix formatting utf-8 explanation messages (:issue:`1379`).
  Thanks :user:`biern` for the PR.

* Fix :ref:`traceback style docs <how-to-modifying-python-tb-printing>` to describe all of the available options
  (auto/long/short/line/native/no), with ``auto`` being the default since v2.6.
  Thanks :user:`hackebrot` for the PR.

* Fix (:issue:`1422`): junit record_xml_property doesn't allow multiple records
  with same name.

- fix #1034: Add missing nodeid on pytest_logwarning call in
  addhook.  Thanks Simon Gomizelj for the PR.

- 'deprecated_call' is now only satisfied with a DeprecationWarning or

- new ``--lf`` and ``-ff`` options to run only the last failing tests or
  "failing tests first" from the last run.  This functionality is provided
  through porting the formerly external pytest-cache plugin into pytest core.
  BACKWARD INCOMPAT: if you used pytest-cache's functionality to persist
  data between test runs be aware that we don't serialize sets anymore.
  Thanks Ronny Pfannschmidt for most of the merging work.

  ``u`` prefix is stripped from unicode strings in expected doctest output. This
  allows doctests which use unicode to run in Python 2 and 3 unchanged.
  Thanks Jason R. Coombs for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

- parametrize now also generates meaningful test IDs for enum, regex and class
  objects (as opposed to class instances).
  Thanks to Florian Bruhin for the PR.

- Add 'warns' to assert that warnings are thrown (like 'raises').
  Thanks to Eric Hunsberger for the PR.

  two or more test methods. Thanks Sergey Chipiga for reporting and Jan
  Bednarik for PR.

- fix issue82: avoid loading conftest files from setup.cfg/pytest.ini/tox.ini
  files and upwards by default (--confcutdir can still be set to override this).
  Thanks Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

- fix issue768: docstrings found in python modules were not setting up session
  fixtures. Thanks Jason R. Coombs for reporting and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

- added ``tmpdir_factory``, a session-scoped fixture that can be used to create
  directories under the base temporary directory. Previously this object was
  installed as a ``_tmpdirhandler`` attribute of the ``config`` object, but now it
  is part of the official API and using ``config._tmpdirhandler`` is
  deprecated.
  Thanks Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

- fix issue808: pytest's internal assertion rewrite hook now implements the
  optional :pep:`302` get_data API so tests can access data files next to them.
  Thanks xmo-odoo for request and example and Bruno Oliveira for
  the PR.

- rootdir and inifile are now displayed during usage errors to help
  users diagnose problems such as unexpected ini files which add
  unknown options being picked up by pytest. Thanks to Pavel Savchenko for
  bringing the problem to attention in #821 and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

- Summary bar now is colored yellow for warning
  situations such as: all tests either were skipped or xpass/xfailed,
  or no tests were run at all (this is a partial fix for issue500).

- fix issue812: pytest now exits with status code 5 in situations where no
  tests were run at all, such as the directory given in the command line does
  not contain any tests or as result of a command line option filters
  all out all tests (-k for example).
  Thanks Eric Siegerman (issue812) and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

- Summary bar now is colored yellow for warning
  situations such as: all tests either were skipped or xpass/xfailed,
  or no tests were run at all (related to issue500).
  Thanks Eric Siegerman.

- New ``testpaths`` ini option: list of directories to search for tests
  when executing pytest from the root directory. This can be used
  to speed up test collection when a project has well specified directories
  for tests, being usually more practical than configuring norecursedirs for
  all directories that do not contain tests.
  Thanks to Adrian for idea (#694) and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

- fix issue713: JUnit XML reports for doctest failures.
  Thanks Punyashloka Biswal.

- fix issue970: internal pytest warnings now appear as "pytest-warnings" in
  the terminal instead of "warnings", so it is clear for users that those
  warnings are from pytest and not from the builtin "warnings" module.
  Thanks Bruno Oliveira.

- Include setup and teardown in junitxml test durations.
  Thanks Janne Vanhala.

- fix issue735: assertion failures on debug versions of Python 3.4+

- new option ``--import-mode`` to allow to change test module importing
  behaviour to append to sys.path instead of prepending.  This better allows
  to run test modules against installed versions of a package even if the
  package under test has the same import root.  In this example::

        testing/__init__.py
        testing/test_pkg_under_test.py
        pkg_under_test/

  the tests will run against the installed version
  of pkg_under_test when ``--import-mode=append`` is used whereas
  by default they would always pick up the local version.  Thanks Holger Krekel.

- pytester: add method ``TmpTestdir.delete_loaded_modules()``, and call it
  from ``inline_run()`` to allow temporary modules to be reloaded.
  Thanks Eduardo Schettino.

- internally refactor pluginmanager API and code so that there
  is a clear distinction between a pytest-agnostic rather simple
  pluginmanager and the PytestPluginManager which adds a lot of
  behaviour, among it handling of the local conftest files.
  In terms of documented methods this is a backward compatible
  change but it might still break 3rd party plugins which relied on
  details like especially the pluginmanager.add_shutdown() API.
  Thanks Holger Krekel.

- pluginmanagement: introduce ``pytest.hookimpl`` and
  ``pytest.hookspec`` decorators for setting impl/spec
  specific parameters.  This substitutes the previous
  now deprecated use of ``pytest.mark`` which is meant to
  contain markers for test functions only.

- write/refine docs for "writing plugins" which now have their
  own page and are separate from the "using/installing plugins`` page.

- fix issue732: properly unregister plugins from any hook calling
  sites allowing to have temporary plugins during test execution.

- deprecate and warn about ``__multicall__`` argument in hook
  implementations.  Use the ``hookwrapper`` mechanism instead already
  introduced with pytest-2.7.

- speed up pytest's own test suite considerably by using inprocess
  tests by default (testrun can be modified with --runpytest=subprocess
  to create subprocesses in many places instead).  The main
  APIs to run pytest in a test is "runpytest()" or "runpytest_subprocess"
  and "runpytest_inprocess" if you need a particular way of running
  the test.  In all cases you get back a RunResult but the inprocess
  one will also have a "reprec" attribute with the recorded events/reports.

- fix monkeypatch.setattr("x.y", raising=False) to actually not raise
  if "y" is not a preexisting attribute. Thanks Florian Bruhin.

- fix issue741: make running output from testdir.run copy/pasteable
  Thanks Bruno Oliveira.

- add a new ``--noconftest`` argument which ignores all ``conftest.py`` files.

- add ``file`` and ``line`` attributes to JUnit-XML output.

- fix issue890: changed extension of all documentation files from ``txt`` to
  ``rst``. Thanks to Abhijeet for the PR.

- fix issue714: add ability to apply indirect=True parameter on particular argnames.
  Thanks Elizaveta239.

- fix issue890: changed extension of all documentation files from ``txt`` to
  ``rst``. Thanks to Abhijeet for the PR.

- fix issue957: "# doctest: SKIP" option will now register doctests as SKIPPED
  rather than PASSED.
  Thanks Thomas Grainger for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

- issue951: add new record_xml_property fixture, that supports logging
  additional information on xml output. Thanks David Diaz for the PR.

- issue949: paths after normal options (for example ``-s``, ``-v``, etc) are now
  properly used to discover ``rootdir`` and ``ini`` files.
  Thanks Peter Lauri for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

2.7.3 (2015-09-15)
==================

- Allow 'dev', 'rc', or other non-integer version strings in ``importorskip``.
  Thanks to Eric Hunsberger for the PR.

- fix issue856: consider --color parameter in all outputs (for example
  --fixtures). Thanks Barney Gale for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

- fix issue855: passing str objects as ``plugins`` argument to pytest.main
  is now interpreted as a module name to be imported and registered as a
  plugin, instead of silently having no effect.
  Thanks xmo-odoo for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

- fix issue744: fix for ast.Call changes in Python 3.5+.  Thanks
  Guido van Rossum, Matthias Bussonnier, Stefan Zimmermann and
  Thomas Kluyver.

- fix issue842: applying markers in classes no longer propagate this markers
  to superclasses which also have markers.
  Thanks xmo-odoo for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

- preserve warning functions after call to pytest.deprecated_call. Thanks
  Pieter Mulder for PR.

- fix issue854: autouse yield_fixtures defined as class members of
  unittest.TestCase subclasses now work as expected.
  Thanks xmo-odoo for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

- fix issue833: --fixtures now shows all fixtures of collected test files, instead of just the
  fixtures declared on the first one.
  Thanks Florian Bruhin for reporting and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

- fix issue863: skipped tests now report the correct reason when a skip/xfail
  condition is met when using multiple markers.
  Thanks Raphael Pierzina for reporting and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

- optimized tmpdir fixture initialization, which should make test sessions
  faster (specially when using pytest-xdist). The only visible effect
  is that now pytest uses a subdirectory in the $TEMP directory for all
  directories created by this fixture (defaults to $TEMP/pytest-$USER).
  Thanks Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

2.7.2 (2015-06-23)
==================

- fix issue767: pytest.raises value attribute does not contain the exception
  instance on Python 2.6. Thanks Eric Siegerman for providing the test
  case and Bruno Oliveira for PR.

- Automatically create directory for junitxml and results log.
  Thanks Aron Curzon.

- fix issue713: JUnit XML reports for doctest failures.
  Thanks Punyashloka Biswal.

- fix issue735: assertion failures on debug versions of Python 3.4+
  Thanks Benjamin Peterson.

- fix issue114: skipif marker reports to internal skipping plugin;
  Thanks Floris Bruynooghe for reporting and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

- fix issue748: unittest.SkipTest reports to internal pytest unittest plugin.
  Thanks Thomas De Schampheleire for reporting and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

- fix issue718: failed to create representation of sets containing unsortable
  elements in python 2. Thanks Edison Gustavo Muenz.

- fix issue756, fix issue752 (and similar issues): depend on py-1.4.29
  which has a refined algorithm for traceback generation.


2.7.1 (2015-05-19)
==================

- fix issue731: do not get confused by the braces which may be present
  and unbalanced in an object's repr while collapsing False
  explanations.  Thanks Carl Meyer for the report and test case.

- fix issue553: properly handling inspect.getsourcelines failures in
  FixtureLookupError which would lead to an internal error,
  obfuscating the original problem. Thanks talljosh for initial
  diagnose/patch and Bruno Oliveira for final patch.

- fix issue660: properly report scope-mismatch-access errors
  independently from ordering of fixture arguments.  Also
  avoid the pytest internal traceback which does not provide
  information to the user. Thanks Holger Krekel.

- streamlined and documented release process.  Also all versions
  (in setup.py and documentation generation) are now read
  from _pytest/__init__.py. Thanks Holger Krekel.

- fixed docs to remove the notion that yield-fixtures are experimental.
  They are here to stay :)  Thanks Bruno Oliveira.

- Support building wheels by using environment markers for the
  requirements.  Thanks Ionel Maries Cristian.

- fixed regression to 2.6.4 which surfaced e.g. in lost stdout capture printing
  when tests raised SystemExit. Thanks Holger Krekel.

- reintroduced _pytest fixture of the pytester plugin which is used
  at least by pytest-xdist.

2.7.0 (2015-03-26)
==================

- fix issue435: make reload() work when assert rewriting is active.
  Thanks Daniel Hahler.

- fix issue616: conftest.py files and their contained fixtures are now
  properly considered for visibility, independently from the exact
  current working directory and test arguments that are used.
  Many thanks to Eric Siegerman and his PR235 which contains
  systematic tests for conftest visibility and now passes.
  This change also introduces the concept of a ``rootdir`` which
  is printed as a new pytest header and documented in the pytest
  customize web page.

- change reporting of "diverted" tests, i.e. tests that are collected
  in one file but actually come from another (e.g. when tests in a test class
  come from a base class in a different file).  We now show the nodeid
  and indicate via a postfix the other file.

- add ability to set command line options by environment variable PYTEST_ADDOPTS.

- added documentation on the new pytest-dev teams on bitbucket and
  github.  See https://pytest.org/en/stable/contributing.html .
  Thanks to Anatoly for pushing and initial work on this.

- fix issue650: new option ``--doctest-ignore-import-errors`` which
  will turn import errors in doctests into skips.  Thanks Charles Cloud
  for the complete PR.

- fix issue655: work around different ways that cause python2/3
  to leak sys.exc_info into fixtures/tests causing failures in 3rd party code

- fix issue615: assertion rewriting did not correctly escape % signs
  when formatting boolean operations, which tripped over mixing
  booleans with modulo operators.  Thanks to Tom Viner for the report,
  triaging and fix.

- implement issue351: add ability to specify parametrize ids as a callable
  to generate custom test ids.  Thanks Brianna Laugher for the idea and
  implementation.

- introduce and document new hookwrapper mechanism useful for plugins
  which want to wrap the execution of certain hooks for their purposes.
  This supersedes the undocumented ``__multicall__`` protocol which
  pytest itself and some external plugins use.  Note that pytest-2.8
  is scheduled to drop supporting the old ``__multicall__``
  and only support the hookwrapper protocol.

- majorly speed up invocation of plugin hooks

- use hookwrapper mechanism in builtin pytest plugins.

- add a doctest ini option for doctest flags, thanks Holger Peters.

- add note to docs that if you want to mark a parameter and the
  parameter is a callable, you also need to pass in a reason to disambiguate
  it from the "decorator" case.  Thanks Tom Viner.

- "python_classes" and "python_functions" options now support glob-patterns
  for test discovery, as discussed in issue600. Thanks Ldiary Translations.

- allow to override parametrized fixtures with non-parametrized ones and vice versa (bubenkoff).

- fix issue463: raise specific error for 'parameterize' misspelling (pfctdayelise).

- On failure, the ``sys.last_value``, ``sys.last_type`` and
  ``sys.last_traceback`` are set, so that a user can inspect the error
  via postmortem debugging (almarklein).

2.6.4 (2014-10-24)
==================

- Improve assertion failure reporting on iterables, by using ndiff and
  pprint.

- removed outdated japanese docs from source tree.

- docs for "pytest_addhooks" hook.  Thanks Bruno Oliveira.

- updated plugin index docs.  Thanks Bruno Oliveira.

- fix issue557: with "-k" we only allow the old style "-" for negation
  at the beginning of strings and even that is deprecated.  Use "not" instead.
  This should allow to pick parametrized tests where "-" appeared in the parameter.

- fix issue604: Escape % character in the assertion message.

- fix issue620: add explanation in the --genscript target about what
  the binary blob means. Thanks Dinu Gherman.

- fix issue614: fixed pastebin support.


- fix issue620: add explanation in the --genscript target about what
  the binary blob means. Thanks Dinu Gherman.

- fix issue614: fixed pastebin support.

2.6.3 (2014-09-24)
==================

- fix issue575: xunit-xml was reporting collection errors as failures
  instead of errors, thanks Oleg Sinyavskiy.

- fix issue582: fix setuptools example, thanks Laszlo Papp and Ronny
  Pfannschmidt.

- Fix infinite recursion bug when pickling capture.EncodedFile, thanks
  Uwe Schmitt.

- fix issue589: fix bad interaction with numpy and others when showing
  exceptions.  Check for precise "maximum recursion depth exceed" exception
  instead of presuming any RuntimeError is that one (implemented in py
  dep).  Thanks Charles Cloud for analysing the issue.

- fix conftest related fixture visibility issue: when running with a
  CWD outside of a test package pytest would get fixture discovery wrong.
  Thanks to Wolfgang Schnerring for figuring out a reproducible example.

- Introduce pytest_enter_pdb hook (needed e.g. by pytest_timeout to cancel the
  timeout when interactively entering pdb).  Thanks Wolfgang Schnerring.

- check xfail/skip also with non-python function test items. Thanks
  Floris Bruynooghe.

2.6.2 (2014-09-05)
==================

- Added function pytest.freeze_includes(), which makes it easy to embed
  pytest into executables using tools like cx_freeze.
  See docs for examples and rationale. Thanks Bruno Oliveira.

- Improve assertion rewriting cache invalidation precision.

- fixed issue561: adapt autouse fixture example for python3.

- fixed issue453: assertion rewriting issue with __repr__ containing
  "\n{", "\n}" and "\n~".

- fix issue560: correctly display code if an "else:" or "finally:" is
  followed by statements on the same line.

- Fix example in monkeypatch documentation, thanks t-8ch.

- fix issue572: correct tmpdir doc example for python3.

- Do not mark as universal wheel because Python 2.6 is different from
  other builds due to the extra argparse dependency.  Fixes issue566.
  Thanks sontek.

- Implement issue549: user-provided assertion messages now no longer
  replace the py.test introspection message but are shown in addition
  to them.

2.6.1 (2014-08-07)
==================

- No longer show line numbers in the --verbose output, the output is now
  purely the nodeid.  The line number is still shown in failure reports.
  Thanks Floris Bruynooghe.

- fix issue437 where assertion rewriting could cause pytest-xdist worker nodes
  to collect different tests. Thanks Bruno Oliveira.

- fix issue555: add "errors" attribute to capture-streams to satisfy
  some distutils and possibly other code accessing sys.stdout.errors.

- fix issue547 capsys/capfd also work when output capturing ("-s") is disabled.

- address issue170: allow pytest.mark.xfail(...) to specify expected exceptions via
  an optional "raises=EXC" argument where EXC can be a single exception
  or a tuple of exception classes.  Thanks David Mohr for the complete
  PR.

- fix integration of pytest with unittest.mock.patch decorator when
  it uses the "new" argument.  Thanks Nicolas Delaby for test and PR.

- fix issue with detecting conftest files if the arguments contain
  "::" node id specifications (copy pasted from "-v" output)

- fix issue544 by only removing "@NUM" at the end of "::" separated parts
  and if the part has a ".py" extension

- don't use py.std import helper, rather import things directly.
  Thanks Bruno Oliveira.

2.6
===

- Cache exceptions from fixtures according to their scope (issue 467).

- fix issue537: Avoid importing old assertion reinterpretation code by default.

- fix issue364: shorten and enhance tracebacks representation by default.
  The new "--tb=auto" option (default) will only display long tracebacks
  for the first and last entry.  You can get the old behaviour of printing
  all entries as long entries with "--tb=long".  Also short entries by
  default are now printed very similarly to "--tb=native" ones.

- fix issue514: teach assertion reinterpretation about private class attributes

- change -v output to include full node IDs of tests.  Users can copy
  a node ID from a test run, including line number, and use it as a
  positional argument in order to run only a single test.

- fix issue 475: fail early and comprehensible if calling
  pytest.raises with wrong exception type.

- fix issue516: tell in getting-started about current dependencies.

- cleanup setup.py a bit and specify supported versions. Thanks Jurko
  Gospodnetic for the PR.

- change XPASS colour to yellow rather than red when tests are run
  with -v.

- fix issue473: work around mock putting an unbound method into a class
  dict when double-patching.

- fix issue498: if a fixture finalizer fails, make sure that
  the fixture is still invalidated.

- fix issue453: the result of the pytest_assertrepr_compare hook now gets
  it's newlines escaped so that format_exception does not blow up.

- internal new warning system: pytest will now produce warnings when
  it detects oddities in your test collection or execution.
  Warnings are ultimately sent to a new pytest_logwarning hook which is
  currently only implemented by the terminal plugin which displays
  warnings in the summary line and shows more details when -rw (report on
  warnings) is specified.

- change skips into warnings for test classes with an __init__ and
  callables in test modules which look like a test but are not functions.

- fix issue436: improved finding of initial conftest files from command
  line arguments by using the result of parse_known_args rather than
  the previous flaky heuristics.  Thanks Marc Abramowitz for tests
  and initial fixing approaches in this area.

- fix issue #479: properly handle nose/unittest(2) SkipTest exceptions
  during collection/loading of test modules.  Thanks to Marc Schlaich
  for the complete PR.

- fix issue490: include pytest_load_initial_conftests in documentation
  and improve docstring.

- fix issue472: clarify that ``pytest.config.getvalue()`` cannot work
  if it's triggered ahead of command line parsing.

- merge PR123: improved integration with mock.patch decorator on tests.

- fix issue412: messing with stdout/stderr FD-level streams is now
  captured without crashes.

- fix issue483: trial/py33 works now properly.  Thanks Daniel Grana for PR.

- improve example for pytest integration with "python setup.py test"
  which now has a generic "-a" or "--pytest-args" option where you
  can pass additional options as a quoted string.  Thanks Trevor Bekolay.

- simplified internal capturing mechanism and made it more robust
  against tests or setups changing FD1/FD2, also better integrated
  now with pytest.pdb() in single tests.

- improvements to pytest's own test-suite leakage detection, courtesy of PRs
  from Marc Abramowitz

- fix issue492: avoid leak in test_writeorg.  Thanks Marc Abramowitz.

- fix issue493: don't run tests in doc directory with ``python setup.py test``
  (use tox -e doctesting for that)

- fix issue486: better reporting and handling of early conftest loading failures

- some cleanup and simplification of internal conftest handling.

- work a bit harder to break reference cycles when catching exceptions.
  Thanks Jurko Gospodnetic.

- fix issue443: fix skip examples to use proper comparison.  Thanks Alex
  Groenholm.

- support nose-style ``__test__`` attribute on modules, classes and
  functions, including unittest-style Classes.  If set to False, the
  test will not be collected.

- fix issue512: show "<notset>" for arguments which might not be set
  in monkeypatch plugin.  Improves output in documentation.


2.5.2 (2014-01-29)
==================

- fix issue409 -- better interoperate with cx_freeze by not
  trying to import from collections.abc which causes problems
  for py27/cx_freeze.  Thanks Wolfgang L. for reporting and tracking it down.

- fixed docs and code to use "pytest" instead of "py.test" almost everywhere.
  Thanks Jurko Gospodnetic for the complete PR.

- fix issue425: mention at end of "py.test -h" that --markers
  and --fixtures work according to specified test path (or current dir)

- fix issue413: exceptions with unicode attributes are now printed
  correctly also on python2 and with pytest-xdist runs. (the fix
  requires py-1.4.20)

- copy, cleanup and integrate py.io capture
  from pylib 1.4.20.dev2 (rev 13d9af95547e)

- address issue416: clarify docs as to conftest.py loading semantics

- fix issue429: comparing byte strings with non-ascii chars in assert
  expressions now work better.  Thanks Floris Bruynooghe.

- make capfd/capsys.capture private, its unused and shouldn't be exposed


2.5.1 (2013-12-17)
==================

- merge new documentation styling PR from Tobias Bieniek.

- fix issue403: allow parametrize of multiple same-name functions within
  a collection node.  Thanks Andreas Kloeckner and Alex Gaynor for reporting
  and analysis.

- Allow parameterized fixtures to specify the ID of the parameters by
  adding an ids argument to pytest.fixture() and pytest.yield_fixture().
  Thanks Floris Bruynooghe.

- fix issue404 by always using the binary xml escape in the junitxml
  plugin.  Thanks Ronny Pfannschmidt.

- fix issue407: fix addoption docstring to point to argparse instead of
  optparse. Thanks Daniel D. Wright.



2.5.0 (2013-12-12)
==================

- dropped python2.5 from automated release testing of pytest itself
  which means it's probably going to break soon (but still works
  with this release we believe).

- simplified and fixed implementation for calling finalizers when
  parametrized fixtures or function arguments are involved.  finalization
  is now performed lazily at setup time instead of in the "teardown phase".
  While this might sound odd at first, it helps to ensure that we are
  correctly handling setup/teardown even in complex code.  User-level code
  should not be affected unless it's implementing the pytest_runtest_teardown
  hook and expecting certain fixture instances are torn down within (very
  unlikely and would have been unreliable anyway).

- PR90: add --color=yes|no|auto option to force terminal coloring
  mode ("auto" is default).  Thanks Marc Abramowitz.

- fix issue319 - correctly show unicode in assertion errors.  Many
  thanks to Floris Bruynooghe for the complete PR.  Also means
  we depend on py>=1.4.19 now.

- fix issue396 - correctly sort and finalize class-scoped parametrized
  tests independently from number of methods on the class.

- refix issue323 in a better way -- parametrization should now never
  cause Runtime Recursion errors because the underlying algorithm
  for re-ordering tests per-scope/per-fixture is not recursive
  anymore (it was tail-call recursive before which could lead
  to problems for more than >966 non-function scoped parameters).

- fix issue290 - there is preliminary support now for parametrizing
  with repeated same values (sometimes useful to test if calling
  a second time works as with the first time).

- close issue240 - document precisely how pytest module importing
  works, discuss the two common test directory layouts, and how it
  interacts with :pep:`420`\-namespace packages.

- fix issue246 fix finalizer order to be LIFO on independent fixtures
  depending on a parametrized higher-than-function scoped fixture.
  (was quite some effort so please bear with the complexity of this sentence :)
  Thanks Ralph Schmitt for the precise failure example.

- fix issue244 by implementing special index for parameters to only use
  indices for parametrized test ids

- fix issue287 by running all finalizers but saving the exception
  from the first failing finalizer and re-raising it so teardown will
  still have failed.  We reraise the first failing exception because
  it might be the cause for other finalizers to fail.

- fix ordering when mock.patch or other standard decorator-wrappings
  are used with test methods.  This fixes issue346 and should
  help with random "xdist" collection failures.  Thanks to
  Ronny Pfannschmidt and Donald Stufft for helping to isolate it.

- fix issue357 - special case "-k" expressions to allow for
  filtering with simple strings that are not valid python expressions.
  Examples: "-k 1.3" matches all tests parametrized with 1.3.
  "-k None" filters all tests that have "None" in their name
  and conversely "-k 'not None'".
  Previously these examples would raise syntax errors.

- fix issue384 by removing the trial support code
  since the unittest compat enhancements allow
  trial to handle it on its own

- don't hide an ImportError when importing a plugin produces one.
  fixes issue375.

- fix issue275 - allow usefixtures and autouse fixtures
  for running doctest text files.

- fix issue380 by making --resultlog only rely on longrepr instead
  of the "reprcrash" attribute which only exists sometimes.

- address issue122: allow @pytest.fixture(params=iterator) by exploding
  into a list early on.

- fix pexpect-3.0 compatibility for pytest's own tests.
  (fixes issue386)

- allow nested parametrize-value markers, thanks James Lan for the PR.

- fix unicode handling with new monkeypatch.setattr(import_path, value)
  API.  Thanks Rob Dennis.  Fixes issue371.

- fix unicode handling with junitxml, fixes issue368.

- In assertion rewriting mode on Python 2, fix the detection of coding
  cookies. See issue #330.

- make "--runxfail" turn imperative pytest.xfail calls into no ops
  (it already did neutralize pytest.mark.xfail markers)

- refine pytest / pkg_resources interactions: The AssertionRewritingHook
  :pep:`302` compliant loader now registers itself with setuptools/pkg_resources
  properly so that the pkg_resources.resource_stream method works properly.
  Fixes issue366.  Thanks for the investigations and full PR to Jason R. Coombs.

- pytestconfig fixture is now session-scoped as it is the same object during the
  whole test run.  Fixes issue370.

- avoid one surprising case of marker malfunction/confusion::

      @pytest.mark.some(lambda arg: ...)
      def test_function():

  would not work correctly because pytest assumes @pytest.mark.some
  gets a function to be decorated already.  We now at least detect if this
  arg is a lambda and thus the example will work.  Thanks Alex Gaynor
  for bringing it up.

- xfail a test on pypy that checks wrong encoding/ascii (pypy does
  not error out). fixes issue385.

- internally make varnames() deal with classes's __init__,
  although it's not needed by pytest itself atm.  Also
  fix caching.  Fixes issue376.

- fix issue221 - handle importing of namespace-package with no
  __init__.py properly.

- refactor internal FixtureRequest handling to avoid monkeypatching.
  One of the positive user-facing effects is that the "request" object
  can now be used in closures.

- fixed version comparison in pytest.importskip(modname, minverstring)

- fix issue377 by clarifying in the nose-compat docs that pytest
  does not duplicate the unittest-API into the "plain" namespace.

- fix verbose reporting for @mock'd test functions

2.4.2 (2013-10-04)
==================

- on Windows require colorama and a newer py lib so that py.io.TerminalWriter()
  now uses colorama instead of its own ctypes hacks. (fixes issue365)
  thanks Paul Moore for bringing it up.

- fix "-k" matching of tests where "repr" and "attr" and other names would
  cause wrong matches because of an internal implementation quirk
  (don't ask) which is now properly implemented. fixes issue345.

- avoid tmpdir fixture to create too long filenames especially
  when parametrization is used (issue354)

- fix pytest-pep8 and pytest-flakes / pytest interactions
  (collection names in mark plugin was assuming an item always
  has a function which is not true for those plugins etc.)
  Thanks Andi Zeidler.

- introduce node.get_marker/node.add_marker API for plugins
  like pytest-pep8 and pytest-flakes to avoid the messy
  details of the node.keywords  pseudo-dicts.  Adapted
  docs.

- remove attempt to "dup" stdout at startup as it's icky.
  the normal capturing should catch enough possibilities
  of tests messing up standard FDs.

- add pluginmanager.do_configure(config) as a link to
  config.do_configure() for plugin-compatibility

2.4.1 (2013-10-02)
==================

- When using parser.addoption() unicode arguments to the
  "type" keyword should also be converted to the respective types.
  thanks Floris Bruynooghe, @dnozay. (fixes issue360 and issue362)

- fix dotted filename completion when using argcomplete
  thanks Anthon van der Neuth. (fixes issue361)

- fix regression when a 1-tuple ("arg",) is used for specifying
  parametrization (the values of the parametrization were passed
  nested in a tuple).  Thanks Donald Stufft.

- merge doc typo fixes, thanks Andy Dirnberger

2.4
===

known incompatibilities:

- if calling --genscript from python2.7 or above, you only get a
  standalone script which works on python2.7 or above.  Use Python2.6
  to also get a python2.5 compatible version.

- all xunit-style teardown methods (nose-style, pytest-style,
  unittest-style) will not be called if the corresponding setup method failed,
  see issue322 below.

- the pytest_plugin_unregister hook wasn't ever properly called
  and there is no known implementation of the hook - so it got removed.

- pytest.fixture-decorated functions cannot be generators (i.e. use
  yield) anymore.  This change might be reversed in 2.4.1 if it causes
  unforeseen real-life issues.  However, you can always write and return
  an inner function/generator and change the fixture consumer to iterate
  over the returned generator.  This change was done in lieu of the new
  ``pytest.yield_fixture`` decorator, see below.

new features:

- experimentally introduce a new ``pytest.yield_fixture`` decorator
  which accepts exactly the same parameters as pytest.fixture but
  mandates a ``yield`` statement instead of a ``return statement`` from
  fixture functions.  This allows direct integration with "with-style"
  context managers in fixture functions and generally avoids registering
  of finalization callbacks in favour of treating the "after-yield" as
  teardown code.  Thanks Andreas Pelme, Vladimir Keleshev, Floris
  Bruynooghe, Ronny Pfannschmidt and many others for discussions.

- allow boolean expression directly with skipif/xfail
  if a "reason" is also specified.  Rework skipping documentation
  to recommend "condition as booleans" because it prevents surprises
  when importing markers between modules.  Specifying conditions
  as strings will remain fully supported.

- reporting: color the last line red or green depending if
  failures/errors occurred or everything passed.  thanks Christian
  Theunert.

- make "import pdb ; pdb.set_trace()" work natively wrt capturing (no
  "-s" needed anymore), making ``pytest.set_trace()`` a mere shortcut.

- fix issue181: --pdb now also works on collect errors (and
  on internal errors) .  This was implemented by a slight internal
  refactoring and the introduction of a new hook
  ``pytest_exception_interact`` hook (see next item).

- fix issue341: introduce new experimental hook for IDEs/terminals to
  intercept debugging: ``pytest_exception_interact(node, call, report)``.

- new monkeypatch.setattr() variant to provide a shorter
  invocation for patching out classes/functions from modules:

     monkeypatch.setattr("requests.get", myfunc)

  will replace the "get" function of the "requests" module with ``myfunc``.

- fix issue322: tearDownClass is not run if setUpClass failed. Thanks
  Mathieu Agopian for the initial fix.  Also make all of pytest/nose
  finalizer mimic the same generic behaviour: if a setupX exists and
  fails, don't run teardownX.  This internally introduces a new method
  "node.addfinalizer()" helper which can only be called during the setup
  phase of a node.

- simplify pytest.mark.parametrize() signature: allow to pass a
  CSV-separated string to specify argnames.  For example:
  ``pytest.mark.parametrize("input,expected",  [(1,2), (2,3)])``
  works as well as the previous:
  ``pytest.mark.parametrize(("input", "expected"), ...)``.

- add support for setUpModule/tearDownModule detection, thanks Brian Okken.

- integrate tab-completion on options through use of "argcomplete".
  Thanks Anthon van der Neut for the PR.

- change option names to be hyphen-separated long options but keep the
  old spelling backward compatible.  py.test -h will only show the
  hyphenated version, for example "--collect-only" but "--collectonly"
  will remain valid as well (for backward-compat reasons).  Many thanks to
  Anthon van der Neut for the implementation and to Hynek Schlawack for
  pushing us.

- fix issue 308 - allow to mark/xfail/skip individual parameter sets
  when parametrizing.  Thanks Brianna Laugher.

- call new experimental pytest_load_initial_conftests hook to allow
  3rd party plugins to do something before a conftest is loaded.

Bug fixes:

- fix issue358 - capturing options are now parsed more properly
  by using a new parser.parse_known_args method.

- pytest now uses argparse instead of optparse (thanks Anthon) which
  means that "argparse" is added as a dependency if installing into python2.6
  environments or below.

- fix issue333: fix a case of bad unittest/pytest hook interaction.

- PR27: correctly handle nose.SkipTest during collection.  Thanks
  Antonio Cuni, Ronny Pfannschmidt.

- fix issue355: junitxml puts name="pytest" attribute to testsuite tag.

- fix issue336: autouse fixture in plugins should work again.

- fix issue279: improve object comparisons on assertion failure
  for standard datatypes and recognise collections.abc.  Thanks to
  Brianna Laugher and Mathieu Agopian.

- fix issue317: assertion rewriter support for the is_package method

- fix issue335: document py.code.ExceptionInfo() object returned
  from pytest.raises(), thanks Mathieu Agopian.

- remove implicit distribute_setup support from setup.py.

- fix issue305: ignore any problems when writing pyc files.

- SO-17664702: call fixture finalizers even if the fixture function
  partially failed (finalizers would not always be called before)

- fix issue320 - fix class scope for fixtures when mixed with
  module-level functions.  Thanks Anatoly Bubenkoff.

- you can specify "-q" or "-qq" to get different levels of "quieter"
  reporting (thanks Katarzyna Jachim)

- fix issue300 - Fix order of conftest loading when starting py.test
  in a subdirectory.

- fix issue323 - sorting of many module-scoped arg parametrizations

- make sessionfinish hooks execute with the same cwd-context as at
  session start (helps fix plugin behaviour which write output files
  with relative path such as pytest-cov)

- fix issue316 - properly reference collection hooks in docs

- fix issue 306 - cleanup of -k/-m options to only match markers/test
  names/keywords respectively.  Thanks Wouter van Ackooy.

- improved doctest counting for doctests in python modules --
  files without any doctest items will not show up anymore
  and doctest examples are counted as separate test items.
  thanks Danilo Bellini.

- fix issue245 by depending on the released py-1.4.14
  which fixes py.io.dupfile to work with files with no
  mode. Thanks Jason R. Coombs.

- fix junitxml generation when test output contains control characters,
  addressing issue267, thanks Jaap Broekhuizen

- fix issue338: honor --tb style for setup/teardown errors as well.  Thanks Maho.

- fix issue307 - use yaml.safe_load in example, thanks Mark Eichin.

- better parametrize error messages, thanks Brianna Laugher

- pytest_terminal_summary(terminalreporter) hooks can now use
  ".section(title)" and ".line(msg)" methods to print extra
  information at the end of a test run.

2.3.5 (2013-04-30)
==================

- fix issue169: respect --tb=style with setup/teardown errors as well.

- never consider a fixture function for test function collection

- allow re-running of test items / helps to fix pytest-reruntests plugin
  and also help to keep less fixture/resource references alive

- put captured stdout/stderr into junitxml output even for passing tests
  (thanks Adam Goucher)

- Issue 265 - integrate nose setup/teardown with setupstate
  so it doesn't try to teardown if it did not setup

- issue 271 - don't write junitxml on worker nodes

- Issue 274 - don't try to show full doctest example
  when doctest does not know the example location

- issue 280 - disable assertion rewriting on buggy CPython 2.6.0

- inject "getfixture()" helper to retrieve fixtures from doctests,
  thanks Andreas Zeidler

- issue 259 - when assertion rewriting, be consistent with the default
  source encoding of ASCII on Python 2

- issue 251 - report a skip instead of ignoring classes with init

- issue250 unicode/str mixes in parametrization names and values now works

- issue257, assertion-triggered compilation of source ending in a
  comment line doesn't blow up in python2.5 (fixed through py>=1.4.13.dev6)

- fix --genscript option to generate standalone scripts that also
  work with python3.3 (importer ordering)

- issue171 - in assertion rewriting, show the repr of some
  global variables

- fix option help for "-k"

- move long description of distribution into README.rst

- improve docstring for metafunc.parametrize()

- fix bug where using capsys with pytest.set_trace() in a test
  function would break when looking at capsys.readouterr()

- allow to specify prefixes starting with "_" when
  customizing python_functions test discovery. (thanks Graham Horler)

- improve PYTEST_DEBUG tracing output by putting
  extra data on a new lines with additional indent

- issue 260 - don't use nose special setup on plain unittest cases

- fix issue134 - print the collect errors that prevent running specified test items

- fix issue266 - accept unicode in MarkEvaluator expressions

2.3.4 (2012-11-20)
==================

- yielded test functions will now have autouse-fixtures active but
  cannot accept fixtures as funcargs - it's anyway recommended to
  rather use the post-2.0 parametrize features instead of yield, see:
  http://pytest.org/en/stable/example/how-to/parametrize.html
- fix autouse-issue where autouse-fixtures would not be discovered
  if defined in an a/conftest.py file and tests in a/tests/test_some.py

- fix issue224 - invocations with >256 char arguments now work
- fix issue91 - add/discuss package/directory level setups in example
- allow to dynamically define markers via
  item.keywords[...]=assignment integrating with "-m" option
- make "-k" accept an expressions the same as with "-m" so that one
  can write: -k "name1 or name2" etc.  This is a slight incompatibility
  if you used special syntax like "TestClass.test_method" which you now
  need to write as -k "TestClass and test_method" to match a certain
  method in a certain test class.

2.3.3 (2012-11-06)
==================

- fix issue214 - parse modules that contain special objects like e. g.
  flask's request object which blows up on getattr access if no request

  do not support an __eq__ operator

- fix issue215 - split test_python.org into multiple files

- fix issue148 - @unittest.skip on classes is now recognized and avoids

- in tracebacks *,** arg values are now shown next to normal arguments
  (thanks Manuel Jacob)

- fix issue217 - support mock.patch with pytest's fixtures - note that
  you need either mock-1.0.1 or the python3.3 builtin unittest.mock.

- fix issue127 - improve documentation for pytest_addoption() and
  add a ``config.getoption(name)`` helper function for consistency.

2.3.2 (2012-10-25)

  now work properly

- fix teardown-ordering for parametrized setups

- fix issue127 - better documentation for pytest_addoption
  and related objects.

- fix unittest behaviour: TestCase.runtest only called if there are
  test methods defined

- improve trial support: don't collect its empty
  unittest.TestCase.runTest() method

- "python setup.py test" now works with pytest itself

- fix/improve internal/packaging related bits:

  - exception message check of test_nose.py now passes on python33 as well

  - issue206 - fix test_assertrewrite.py to work when a global
    PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 is present

  - add tox.ini to pytest distribution so that ignore-dirs and others config
    bits are properly distributed for maintainers who run pytest-own tests

2.3.1 (2012-10-20)
==================

- fix issue202 - fix regression: using "self" from fixture functions now
  works as expected (it's the same "self" instance that a test method
  which uses the fixture sees)

- skip pexpect using tests (test_pdb.py mostly) on freebsd* systems
  due to pexpect not supporting it properly (hanging)

- link to web pages from --markers output which provides help for
  pytest.mark.* usage.

2.3.0 (2012-10-19)
==================

- fix issue202 - better automatic names for parametrized test functions
- fix issue139 - introduce @pytest.fixture which allows direct scoping
  and parametrization of funcarg factories.
- fix issue198 - conftest fixtures were not found on windows32 in some
  circumstances with nested directory structures due to path manipulation issues
- fix issue193 skip test functions with were parametrized with empty
  parameter sets

- fix issue185 monkeypatching time.time does not cause pytest to fail
- fix issue172 duplicate call of pytest.fixture decoratored setup_module
  functions

  it is constructed correctly from the original current working dir.
- fix "python setup.py test" example to cause a proper "errno" return
- fix issue165 - fix broken doc links and mention stackoverflow for FAQ
- catch unicode-issues when writing failure representations
  to terminal to prevent the whole session from crashing
- fix xfail/skip confusion: a skip-mark or an imperative pytest.skip
  will now take precedence before xfail-markers because we
  can't determine xfail/xpass status in case of a skip. see also:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11105828/in-py-test-when-i-explicitly-skip-a-test-that-is-marked-as-xfail-how-can-i-get

- always report installed 3rd party plugins in the header of a test run

- fix issue160: a failing setup of an xfail-marked tests should
  be reported as xfail (not xpass)

- fix issue128: show captured output when capsys/capfd are used

- fix issue179: properly show the dependency chain of factories

- pluginmanager.register(...) now raises ValueError if the
  plugin has been already registered or the name is taken

- fix issue159: improve https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.0.1/faq.html
  especially with respect to the "magic" history, also mention
  pytest-django, trial and unittest integration.

- make request.keywords and node.keywords writable.  All descendant
  collection nodes will see keyword values.  Keywords are dictionaries
  containing markers and other info.

- fix issue 178: xml binary escapes are now wrapped in py.xml.raw

- fix issue 176: correctly catch the builtin AssertionError
  even when we replaced AssertionError with a subclass on the
  python level

                 before calling into a test

- fix issue 191: add unittest TestCase runTest method support
- fix issue 156: monkeypatch correctly handles class level descriptors

- reporting refinements:

  - pytest_report_header now receives a "startdir" so that
    you can use startdir.bestrelpath(yourpath) to show
    nice relative path

  - allow plugins to implement both pytest_report_header and
    pytest_sessionstart (sessionstart is invoked first).

  - don't show deselected reason line if there is none

  - py.test -vv will show all of assert comparisons instead of truncating

2.2.4 (2012-05-22)
==================

- fix error message for rewritten assertions involving the % operator
- fix issue 126: correctly match all invalid xml characters for junitxml
  binary escape
- fix issue with unittest: now @unittest.expectedFailure markers should
  be processed correctly (you can also use @pytest.mark markers)
- document integration with the extended distribute/setuptools test commands
- fix issue 140: properly get the real functions
  of bound classmethods for setup/teardown_class
- fix issue #141: switch from the deceased paste.pocoo.org to bpaste.net
- fix issue #143: call unconfigure/sessionfinish always when
  configure/sessionstart where called
- fix issue #144: better mangle test ids to junitxml classnames
- upgrade distribute_setup.py to 0.6.27

2.2.3 (2012-02-05)
==================

- fix uploaded package to only include necessary files

2.2.2 (2012-02-05)
==================

- fix issue101: wrong args to unittest.TestCase test function now
  produce better output
- fix issue102: report more useful errors and hints for when a
  test directory was renamed and some pyc/__pycache__ remain
- fix issue106: allow parametrize to be applied multiple times
  e.g. from module, class and at function level.
- fix issue107: actually perform session scope finalization
- don't check in parametrize if indirect parameters are funcarg names
- add chdir method to monkeypatch funcarg
- fix crash resulting from calling monkeypatch undo a second time
- fix issue115: make --collectonly robust against early failure
  (missing files/directories)
- "-qq --collectonly" now shows only files and the number of tests in them
- "-q --collectonly" now shows test ids
- allow adding of attributes to test reports such that it also works
  with distributed testing (no upgrade of pytest-xdist needed)

2.2.1 (2011-12-16)
==================

- fix issue99 (in pytest and py) internallerrors with resultlog now
  produce better output - fixed by normalizing pytest_internalerror
  input arguments.
- fix issue97 / traceback issues (in pytest and py) improve traceback output
  in conjunction with jinja2 and cython which hack tracebacks
- fix issue93 (in pytest and pytest-xdist) avoid "delayed teardowns":
  the final test in a test node will now run its teardown directly
  instead of waiting for the end of the session. Thanks Dave Hunt for
  the good reporting and feedback.  The pytest_runtest_protocol as well
  as the pytest_runtest_teardown hooks now have "nextitem" available
  which will be None indicating the end of the test run.
- fix collection crash due to unknown-source collected items, thanks
  to Ralf Schmitt (fixed by depending on a more recent pylib)

2.2.0 (2011-11-18)
==================

- fix issue90: introduce eager tearing down of test items so that
  teardown function are called earlier.
- add an all-powerful metafunc.parametrize function which allows to
  parametrize test function arguments in multiple steps and therefore
  from independent plugins and places.
- add a @pytest.mark.parametrize helper which allows to easily
  call a test function with different argument values
- Add examples to the "parametrize" example page, including a quick port
  of Test scenarios and the new parametrize function and decorator.
- introduce registration for "pytest.mark.*" helpers via ini-files
  or through plugin hooks.  Also introduce a "--strict" option which
  will treat unregistered markers as errors
  allowing to avoid typos and maintain a well described set of markers
  for your test suite.  See examples at http://pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/mark.html
  and its links.
- issue50: introduce "-m marker" option to select tests based on markers
  (this is a stricter and more predictable version of '-k' in that "-m"
  only matches complete markers and has more obvious rules for and/or
  semantics.
- new feature to help optimizing the speed of your tests:
  --durations=N option for displaying N slowest test calls
  and setup/teardown methods.
- fix issue87: --pastebin now works with python3
- fix issue89: --pdb with unexpected exceptions in doctest work more sensibly
- fix and cleanup pytest's own test suite to not leak FDs
- fix issue83: link to generated funcarg list
- fix issue74: pyarg module names are now checked against imp.find_module false positives
- fix compatibility with twisted/trial-11.1.0 use cases
- simplify Node.listchain
- simplify junitxml output code by relying on py.xml
- add support for skip properties on unittest classes and functions

- correctly handle zero length arguments (a la pytest '')
- fix issue67 / junitxml now contains correct test durations, thanks ronny
- fix issue75 / skipping test failure on jython
- fix issue77 / Allow assertrepr_compare hook to apply to a subset of tests

2.1.2 (2011-09-24)
==================

- fix assertion rewriting on files with windows newlines on some Python versions
- refine test discovery by package/module name (--pyargs), thanks Florian Mayer
- fix issue69 / assertion rewriting fixed on some boolean operations
- fix issue68 / packages now work with assertion rewriting
- fix issue66: use different assertion rewriting caches when the -O option is passed
- don't try assertion rewriting on Jython, use reinterp

2.1.1
=====

- fix issue64 / pytest.set_trace now works within pytest_generate_tests hooks
- fix issue60 / fix error conditions involving the creation of __pycache__
- fix issue63 / assertion rewriting on inserts involving strings containing '%'
- fix assertion rewriting on calls with a ** arg
- don't cache rewritten modules if bytecode generation is disabled
- fix assertion rewriting in read-only directories
- fix issue59: provide system-out/err tags for junitxml output
- fix issue61: assertion rewriting on boolean operations with 3 or more operands
- you can now build a man page with "cd doc ; make man"

2.1.0 (2011-07-09)
==================

- fix issue53 call nosestyle setup functions with correct ordering
- fix issue58 and issue59: new assertion code fixes
- merge Benjamin's assertionrewrite branch: now assertions
  for test modules on python 2.6 and above are done by rewriting
  the AST and saving the pyc file before the test module is imported.
  see doc/assert.txt for more info.
- fix issue43: improve doctests with better traceback reporting on
  unexpected exceptions
- fix issue47: timing output in junitxml for test cases is now correct
- fix issue48: typo in MarkInfo repr leading to exception
- fix issue49: avoid confusing error when initialization partially fails
- fix issue44: env/username expansion for junitxml file path
- show releaselevel information in test runs for pypy
- reworked doc pages for better navigation and PDF generation
- report KeyboardInterrupt even if interrupted during session startup
- fix issue 35 - provide PDF doc version and download link from index page

2.0.3 (2011-05-11)
==================

- fix issue38: nicer tracebacks on calls to hooks, particularly early
  configure/sessionstart ones

- fix missing skip reason/meta information in junitxml files, reported
  via http://lists.idyll.org/pipermail/testing-in-python/2011-March/003928.html

- fix issue34: avoid collection failure with "test" prefixed classes
  deriving from object.

- don't require zlib (and other libs) for genscript plugin without
  --genscript actually being used.

- speed up skips (by not doing a full traceback representation
  internally)

- fix issue37: avoid invalid characters in junitxml's output

2.0.2 (2011-03-09)
==================

- tackle issue32 - speed up test runs of very quick test functions
  by reducing the relative overhead

- fix issue30 - extended xfail/skipif handling and improved reporting.
  If you have a syntax error in your skip/xfail
  expressions you now get nice error reports.

  Also you can now access module globals from xfail/skipif
  expressions so that this for example works now::

    import pytest
    import mymodule
    @pytest.mark.skipif("mymodule.__version__[0] == "1")
    def test_function():
        pass

  This will not run the test function if the module's version string
  does not start with a "1".  Note that specifying a string instead
  of a boolean expressions allows py.test to report meaningful information
  when summarizing a test run as to what conditions lead to skipping
  (or xfail-ing) tests.

- fix issue28 - setup_method and pytest_generate_tests work together
  The setup_method fixture method now gets called also for
  test function invocations generated from the pytest_generate_tests
  hook.

- fix issue27 - collectonly and keyword-selection (-k) now work together
  Also, if you do "py.test --collectonly -q" you now get a flat list
  of test ids that you can use to paste to the py.test commandline
  in order to execute a particular test.

- fix issue25 avoid reported problems with --pdb and python3.2/encodings output

- fix issue23 - tmpdir argument now works on Python3.2 and WindowsXP
  Starting with Python3.2 os.symlink may be supported. By requiring
  a newer py lib version the py.path.local() implementation acknowledges
  this.

- fixed typos in the docs (thanks Victor Garcia, Brianna Laugher) and particular
  thanks to Laura Creighton who also reviewed parts of the documentation.

- fix slightly wrong output of verbose progress reporting for classes
  (thanks Amaury)

- more precise (avoiding of) deprecation warnings for node.Class|Function accesses

- avoid std unittest assertion helper code in tracebacks (thanks Ronny)

2.0.1 (2011-02-07)
==================

- refine and unify initial capturing so that it works nicely
  even if the logging module is used on an early-loaded conftest.py
  file or plugin.
- allow to omit "()" in test ids to allow for uniform test ids
  as produced by Alfredo's nice pytest.vim plugin.
- fix issue12 - show plugin versions with "--version" and
  "--traceconfig" and also document how to add extra information
  to reporting test header
- fix issue17 (import-* reporting issue on python3) by
  requiring py>1.4.0 (1.4.1 is going to include it)
- fix issue10 (numpy arrays truth checking) by refining
  assertion interpretation in py lib
- fix issue15: make nose compatibility tests compatible
  with python3 (now that nose-1.0 supports python3)
- remove somewhat surprising "same-conftest" detection because
  it ignores conftest.py when they appear in several subdirs.
- improve assertions ("not in"), thanks Floris Bruynooghe
- improve behaviour/warnings when running on top of "python -OO"
  (assertions and docstrings are turned off, leading to potential
  false positives)
- introduce a pytest_cmdline_processargs(args) hook
  to allow dynamic computation of command line arguments.
  This fixes a regression because py.test prior to 2.0
  allowed to set command line options from conftest.py
  files which so far pytest-2.0 only allowed from ini-files now.
- fix issue7: assert failures in doctest modules.
  unexpected failures in doctests will not generally
  show nicer, i.e. within the doctest failing context.
- fix issue9: setup/teardown functions for an xfail-marked
  test will report as xfail if they fail but report as normally
  passing (not xpassing) if they succeed.  This only is true
  for "direct" setup/teardown invocations because teardown_class/
  teardown_module cannot closely relate to a single test.
- fix issue14: no logging errors at process exit
- refinements to "collecting" output on non-ttys
- refine internal plugin registration and --traceconfig output
- introduce a mechanism to prevent/unregister plugins from the
  command line, see http://pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/plugins.html#cmdunregister
- activate resultlog plugin by default
- fix regression wrt yielded tests which due to the
  collection-before-running semantics were not
  setup as with pytest 1.3.4.  Note, however, that
  the recommended and much cleaner way to do test
  parameterization remains the "pytest_generate_tests"
  mechanism, see the docs.

2.0.0 (2010-11-25)
==================

- pytest-2.0 is now its own package and depends on pylib-2.0
- new ability: python -m pytest / python -m pytest.main ability
- new python invocation: pytest.main(args, plugins) to load
  some custom plugins early.
- try harder to run unittest test suites in a more compatible manner
  by deferring setup/teardown semantics to the unittest package.
  also work harder to run twisted/trial and Django tests which
  should now basically work by default.
- introduce a new way to set config options via ini-style files,
  by default setup.cfg and tox.ini files are searched.  The old
  ways (certain environment variables, dynamic conftest.py reading
  is removed).
- add a new "-q" option which decreases verbosity and prints a more
  nose/unittest-style "dot" output.
- fix issue135 - marks now work with unittest test cases as well
- fix issue126 - introduce py.test.set_trace() to trace execution via
  PDB during the running of tests even if capturing is ongoing.
- fix issue123 - new "python -m py.test" invocation for py.test
  (requires Python 2.5 or above)
- fix issue124 - make reporting more resilient against tests opening
  files on filedescriptor 1 (stdout).
- fix issue109 - sibling conftest.py files will not be loaded.
  (and Directory collectors cannot be customized anymore from a Directory's
  conftest.py - this needs to happen at least one level up).
- introduce (customizable) assertion failure representations and enhance
  output on assertion failures for comparisons and other cases (Floris Bruynooghe)
- nose-plugin: pass through type-signature failures in setup/teardown
  functions instead of not calling them (Ed Singleton)
- remove py.test.collect.Directory (follows from a major refactoring
  and simplification of the collection process)
- majorly reduce py.test core code, shift function/python testing to own plugin
- fix issue88 (finding custom test nodes from command line arg)
- refine 'tmpdir' creation, will now create basenames better associated
  with test names (thanks Ronny)
- "xpass" (unexpected pass) tests don't cause exitcode!=0
- fix issue131 / issue60 - importing doctests in __init__ files used as namespace packages
- fix issue93 stdout/stderr is captured while importing conftest.py
- fix bug: unittest collected functions now also can have "pytestmark"
  applied at class/module level
- add ability to use "class" level for cached_setup helper
- fix strangeness: mark.* objects are now immutable, create new instances

1.3.4 (2010-09-14)
==================

- fix issue111: improve install documentation for windows
- fix issue119: fix custom collectability of __init__.py as a module
- fix issue116: --doctestmodules work with __init__.py files as well
- fix issue115: unify internal exception passthrough/catching/GeneratorExit
- fix issue118: new --tb=native for presenting cpython-standard exceptions

1.3.3 (2010-07-30)
==================

- fix issue113: assertion representation problem with triple-quoted strings
  (and possibly other cases)
- make conftest loading detect that a conftest file with the same
  content was already loaded, avoids surprises in nested directory structures
  which can be produced e.g. by Hudson. It probably removes the need to use
  --confcutdir in most cases.
- fix terminal coloring for win32
  (thanks Michael Foord for reporting)
- fix weirdness: make terminal width detection work on stdout instead of stdin
  (thanks Armin Ronacher for reporting)
- remove trailing whitespace in all py/text distribution files

1.3.2 (2010-07-08)
==================

**New features**

- fix issue103:  introduce py.test.raises as context manager, examples::

    with py.test.raises(ZeroDivisionError):
        x = 0
        1 / x

    with py.test.raises(RuntimeError) as excinfo:
        call_something()

    # you may do extra checks on excinfo.value|type|traceback here

  (thanks Ronny Pfannschmidt)

- Funcarg factories can now dynamically apply a marker to a
  test invocation.  This is for example useful if a factory
  provides parameters to a test which are expected-to-fail::

    def pytest_funcarg__arg(request):
        request.applymarker(py.test.mark.xfail(reason="flaky config"))
        ...

    def test_function(arg):
        ...

- improved error reporting on collection and import errors. This makes
  use of a more general mechanism, namely that for custom test item/collect
  nodes ``node.repr_failure(excinfo)`` is now uniformly called so that you can
  override it to return a string error representation of your choice
  which is going to be reported as a (red) string.

- introduce '--junitprefix=STR' option to prepend a prefix
  to all reports in the junitxml file.

**Bug fixes**

- make tests and the ``pytest_recwarn`` plugin in particular fully compatible
  to Python2.7 (if you use the ``recwarn`` funcarg warnings will be enabled so that
  you can properly check for their existence in a cross-python manner).
- refine --pdb: ignore xfailed tests, unify its TB-reporting and
  don't display failures again at the end.
- fix assertion interpretation with the ** operator (thanks Benjamin Peterson)
- fix issue105 assignment on the same line as a failing assertion (thanks Benjamin Peterson)
- fix issue104 proper escaping for test names in junitxml plugin (thanks anonymous)
- fix issue57 -f|--looponfail to work with xpassing tests (thanks Ronny)
- fix issue92 collectonly reporter and --pastebin (thanks Benjamin Peterson)
- fix py.code.compile(source) to generate unique filenames
- fix assertion re-interp problems on PyPy, by deferring code
  compilation to the (overridable) Frame.eval class. (thanks Amaury Forgeot)
- fix py.path.local.pyimport() to work with directories
- streamline py.path.local.mkdtemp implementation and usage
- don't print empty lines when showing junitxml-filename
- add optional boolean ignore_errors parameter to py.path.local.remove
- fix terminal writing on win32/python2.4
- py.process.cmdexec() now tries harder to return properly encoded unicode objects
  on all python versions
- install plain py.test/py.which scripts also for Jython, this helps to
  get canonical script paths in virtualenv situations
- make path.bestrelpath(path) return ".", note that when calling
  X.bestrelpath the assumption is that X is a directory.
- make initial conftest discovery ignore "--" prefixed arguments
- fix resultlog plugin when used in a multicpu/multihost xdist situation
  (thanks Jakub Gustak)
- perform distributed testing related reporting in the xdist-plugin
  rather than having dist-related code in the generic py.test
  distribution
- fix homedir detection on Windows
- ship distribute_setup.py version 0.6.13

1.3.1 (2010-05-25)
==================

**New features**

- issue91: introduce new py.test.xfail(reason) helper
  to imperatively mark a test as expected to fail. Can
  be used from within setup and test functions. This is
  useful especially for parametrized tests when certain
  configurations are expected-to-fail.  In this case the
  declarative approach with the @py.test.mark.xfail cannot
  be used as it would mark all configurations as xfail.

- issue102: introduce new --maxfail=NUM option to stop
  test runs after NUM failures.  This is a generalization
  of the '-x' or '--exitfirst' option which is now equivalent
  to '--maxfail=1'.  Both '-x' and '--maxfail' will
  now also print a line near the end indicating the Interruption.

- issue89: allow py.test.mark decorators to be used on classes
  (class decorators were introduced with python2.6) and
  also allow to have multiple markers applied at class/module level
  by specifying a list.

- improve and refine letter reporting in the progress bar:
  .  pass
  f  failed test
  s  skipped tests (reminder: use for dependency/platform mismatch only)
  x  xfailed test (test that was expected to fail)
  X  xpassed test (test that was expected to fail but passed)

  You can use any combination of 'fsxX' with the '-r' extended
  reporting option. The xfail/xpass results will show up as
  skipped tests in the junitxml output - which also fixes
  issue99.

- make py.test.cmdline.main() return the exitstatus instead of raising
  SystemExit and also allow it to be called multiple times.  This of
  course requires that your application and tests are properly teared
  down and don't have global state.

**Bug Fixes**

- improved traceback presentation:
  - improved and unified reporting for "--tb=short" option
  - Errors during test module imports are much shorter, (using --tb=short style)
  - raises shows shorter more relevant tracebacks
  - --fulltrace now more systematically makes traces longer / inhibits cutting

- improve support for raises and other dynamically compiled code by
  manipulating python's linecache.cache instead of the previous
  rather hacky way of creating custom code objects.  This makes
  it seamlessly work on Jython and PyPy where it previously didn't.

- fix issue96: make capturing more resilient against Control-C
  interruptions (involved somewhat substantial refactoring
  to the underlying capturing functionality to avoid race
  conditions).

- fix chaining of conditional skipif/xfail decorators - so it works now
  as expected to use multiple @py.test.mark.skipif(condition) decorators,
  including specific reporting which of the conditions lead to skipping.

- fix issue95: late-import zlib so that it's not required
  for general py.test startup.

- fix issue94: make reporting more robust against bogus source code
  (and internally be more careful when presenting unexpected byte sequences)


1.3.0 (2010-05-05)
==================

- deprecate --report option in favour of a new shorter and easier to
  remember -r option: it takes a string argument consisting of any
  combination of 'xfsX' characters.  They relate to the single chars
  you see during the dotted progress printing and will print an extra line
  per test at the end of the test run.  This extra line indicates the exact
  position or test ID that you directly paste to the py.test cmdline in order
  to re-run a particular test.

- allow external plugins to register new hooks via the new
  pytest_addhooks(pluginmanager) hook.  The new release of
  the pytest-xdist plugin for distributed and looponfailing
  testing requires this feature.

- add a new pytest_ignore_collect(path, config) hook to allow projects and
  plugins to define exclusion behaviour for their directory structure -
  for example you may define in a conftest.py this method::

        def pytest_ignore_collect(path):
            return path.check(link=1)

  to prevent even a collection try of any tests in symlinked dirs.

- new pytest_pycollect_makemodule(path, parent) hook for
  allowing customization of the Module collection object for a
  matching test module.

- extend and refine xfail mechanism:
  ``@py.test.mark.xfail(run=False)`` do not run the decorated test
  ``@py.test.mark.xfail(reason="...")`` prints the reason string in xfail summaries
  specifying ``--runxfail`` on command line virtually ignores xfail markers

- expose (previously internal) commonly useful methods:
  py.io.get_terminal_with() -> return terminal width
  py.io.ansi_print(...) -> print colored/bold text on linux/win32
  py.io.saferepr(obj) -> return limited representation string

- expose test outcome related exceptions as py.test.skip.Exception,
  py.test.raises.Exception etc., useful mostly for plugins
  doing special outcome interpretation/tweaking

- (issue85) fix junitxml plugin to handle tests with non-ascii output

- fix/refine python3 compatibility (thanks Benjamin Peterson)

- fixes for making the jython/win32 combination work, note however:
  jython2.5.1/win32 does not provide a command line launcher, see
  https://bugs.jython.org/issue1491 . See pylib install documentation
  for how to work around.

- fixes for handling of unicode exception values and unprintable objects

- (issue87) fix unboundlocal error in assertionold code

- (issue86) improve documentation for looponfailing

- refine IO capturing: stdin-redirect pseudo-file now has a NOP close() method

- ship distribute_setup.py version 0.6.10

- added links to the new capturelog and coverage plugins


1.2.0 (2010-01-18)
==================

- refined usage and options for "py.cleanup"::

    py.cleanup     # remove "*.pyc" and "*$py.class" (jython) files
    py.cleanup -e .swp -e .cache # also remove files with these extensions
    py.cleanup -s  # remove "build" and "dist" directory next to setup.py files
    py.cleanup -d  # also remove empty directories
    py.cleanup -a  # synonym for "-s -d -e 'pip-log.txt'"
    py.cleanup -n  # dry run, only show what would be removed

- add a new option "py.test --funcargs" which shows available funcargs
  and their help strings (docstrings on their respective factory function)
  for a given test path

- display a short and concise traceback if a funcarg lookup fails

- early-load "conftest.py" files in non-dot first-level sub directories.
  allows to conveniently keep and access test-related options in a ``test``
  subdir and still add command line options.

- fix issue67: new super-short traceback-printing option: "--tb=line" will print a single line for each failing (python) test indicating its filename, lineno and the failure value

- fix issue78: always call python-level teardown functions even if the
  according setup failed.  This includes refinements for calling setup_module/class functions
  which will now only be called once instead of the previous behaviour where they'd be called
  multiple times if they raise an exception (including a Skipped exception).  Any exception
  will be re-corded and associated with all tests in the according module/class scope.

- fix issue63: assume <40 columns to be a bogus terminal width, default to 80

- fix pdb debugging to be in the correct frame on raises-related errors

- update apipkg.py to fix an issue where recursive imports might
  unnecessarily break importing

- fix plugin links

1.1.1 (2009-11-24)
==================

- moved dist/looponfailing from py.test core into a new
  separately released pytest-xdist plugin.

- new junitxml plugin: --junitxml=path will generate a junit style xml file
  which is processable e.g. by the Hudson CI system.

- new option: --genscript=path will generate a standalone py.test script
  which will not need any libraries installed.  thanks to Ralf Schmitt.

- new option: --ignore will prevent specified path from collection.
  Can be specified multiple times.

- new option: --confcutdir=dir will make py.test only consider conftest
  files that are relative to the specified dir.

- new funcarg: "pytestconfig" is the pytest config object for access
  to command line args and can now be easily used in a test.

- install ``py.test`` and ``py.which`` with a ``-$VERSION`` suffix to
  disambiguate between Python3, python2.X, Jython and PyPy installed versions.

- new "pytestconfig" funcarg allows access to test config object

- new "pytest_report_header" hook can return additional lines
  to be displayed at the header of a test run.

- (experimental) allow "py.test path::name1::name2::..." for pointing
  to a test within a test collection directly.  This might eventually
  evolve as a full substitute to "-k" specifications.

- streamlined plugin loading: order is now as documented in
  customize.html: setuptools, ENV, commandline, conftest.
  also setuptools entry point names are turned to canonical names ("pytest_*")

- automatically skip tests that need 'capfd' but have no os.dup

- allow pytest_generate_tests to be defined in classes as well

- deprecate usage of 'disabled' attribute in favour of pytestmark
- deprecate definition of Directory, Module, Class and Function nodes
  in conftest.py files.  Use pytest collect hooks instead.

- collection/item node specific runtest/collect hooks are only called exactly
  on matching conftest.py files, i.e. ones which are exactly below
  the filesystem path of an item

- change: the first pytest_collect_directory hook to return something
  will now prevent further hooks to be called.

- change: figleaf plugin now requires --figleaf to run.  Also
  change its long command line options to be a bit shorter (see py.test -h).

- change: pytest doctest plugin is now enabled by default and has a
  new option --doctest-glob to set a pattern for file matches.

- change: remove internal py._* helper vars, only keep py._pydir

- robustify capturing to survive if custom pytest_runtest_setup
  code failed and prevented the capturing setup code from running.

- make py.test.* helpers provided by default plugins visible early -
  works transparently both for pydoc and for interactive sessions
  which will regularly see e.g. py.test.mark and py.test.importorskip.

- simplify internal plugin manager machinery
- simplify internal collection tree by introducing a RootCollector node

- fix assert reinterpreation that sees a call containing "keyword=..."

- fix issue66: invoke pytest_sessionstart and pytest_sessionfinish
  hooks on worker nodes during dist-testing, report module/session teardown
  hooks correctly.

- fix issue65: properly handle dist-testing if no
  execnet/py lib installed remotely.

- skip some install-tests if no execnet is available

- fix docs, fix internal bin/ script generation


1.1.0 (2009-11-05)
==================

- introduce automatic plugin registration via 'pytest11'
  entrypoints via setuptools' pkg_resources.iter_entry_points

- fix py.test dist-testing to work with execnet >= 1.0.0b4

- re-introduce py.test.cmdline.main() for better backward compatibility

- svn paths: fix a bug with path.check(versioned=True) for svn paths,
  allow '%' in svn paths, make svnwc.update() default to interactive mode
  like in 1.0.x and add svnwc.update(interactive=False) to inhibit interaction.

- refine distributed tarball to contain test and no pyc files

- try harder to have deprecation warnings for py.compat.* accesses
  report a correct location

1.0.3
=====

* adjust and improve docs

* remove py.rest tool and internal namespace - it was
  never really advertised and can still be used with
  the old release if needed.  If there is interest
  it could be revived into its own tool i guess.

* fix issue48 and issue59: raise an Error if the module
  from an imported test file does not seem to come from
  the filepath - avoids "same-name" confusion that has
  been reported repeatedly

  nose-style setup_module() and setup() functions are
  supported

  for test functions with multiple arguments.

* merge Jarko's fixes, issue #45 and #46

* add the ability to specify a path for py.lookup to search in

* fix a funcarg cached_setup bug probably only occurring
  in distributed testing and "module" scope with teardown.

* consolidate and cleanup py/code classes and files

* cleanup py/misc, move tests to bin-for-dist

* introduce delattr/delitem/delenv methods to py.test's monkeypatch funcarg

* consolidate py.log implementation, remove old approach.

* introduce py.io.TextIO and py.io.BytesIO for distinguishing between
  text/unicode and byte-streams (uses underlying standard lib io.*
  if available)

* make py.unittest_convert helper script available which converts "unittest.py"
  style files into the simpler assert/direct-test-classes py.test/nosetests
  style.  The script was written by Laura Creighton.

* simplified internal localpath implementation

1.0.2 (2009-08-27)
==================

* fixing packaging issues, triggered by fedora redhat packaging,
  also added doc, examples and contrib dirs to the tarball.

* added a documentation link to the new django plugin.

1.0.1 (2009-08-19)
==================

* added a 'pytest_nose' plugin which handles nose.SkipTest,
  nose-style function/method/generator setup/teardown and
  tries to report functions correctly.

* capturing of unicode writes or encoded strings to sys.stdout/err
  work better, also terminalwriting was adapted and somewhat
  unified between windows and linux.

* improved documentation layout and content a lot

* added a "--help-config" option to show conftest.py / ENV-var names for
  all longopt cmdline options, and some special conftest.py variables.
  renamed 'conf_capture' conftest setting to 'option_capture' accordingly.

* fix issue #27: better reporting on non-collectable items given on commandline
  (e.g. pyc files)

* fix issue #33: added --version flag (thanks Benjamin Peterson)

* fix svn-1.6 compat issue with py.path.svnwc().versioned()
  (thanks Wouter Vanden Hove)

* setup/teardown or collection problems now show as ERRORs
  or with big "E"'s in the progress lines.  they are reported
  and counted separately.

* dist-testing: properly handle test items that get locally
  collected but cannot be collected on the remote side - often
  due to platform/dependency reasons

* simplified py.test.mark API - see keyword plugin documentation

* integrate better with logging: capturing now by default captures
  test functions and their immediate setup/teardown in a single stream

* capsys and capfd funcargs now have a readouterr() and a close() method
  (underlyingly py.io.StdCapture/FD objects are used which grew a
  readouterr() method as well to return snapshots of captured out/err)

* make assert-reinterpretation work better with comparisons not
  returning bools (reported with numpy from thanks maciej fijalkowski)

* reworked per-test output capturing into the pytest_iocapture.py plugin
  and thus removed capturing code from config object

* item.repr_failure(excinfo) instead of item.repr_failure(excinfo, outerr)


1.0.0b8 (2009-07-22)
====================

* pytest_unittest-plugin is now enabled by default

* introduced pytest_keyboardinterrupt hook and
  refined pytest_sessionfinish hooked, added tests.

* workaround a buggy logging module interaction ("closing already closed
  files").  Thanks to Sridhar Ratnakumar for triggering.

* if plugins use "py.test.importorskip" for importing
  a dependency only a warning will be issued instead
  of exiting the testing process.

* many improvements to docs:
  - refined funcargs doc , use the term "factory" instead of "provider"
  - added a new talk/tutorial doc page
  - better download page
  - better plugin docstrings
  - added new plugins page and automatic doc generation script

* fixed teardown problem related to partially failing funcarg setups
  (thanks MrTopf for reporting), "pytest_runtest_teardown" is now
  always invoked even if the "pytest_runtest_setup" failed.

* tweaked doctest output for docstrings in py modules,
  thanks Radomir.

1.0.0b7
=======

* renamed py.test.xfail back to py.test.mark.xfail to avoid
  two ways to decorate for xfail

* re-added py.test.mark decorator for setting keywords on functions
  (it was actually documented so removing it was not nice)

* remove scope-argument from request.addfinalizer() because
  request.cached_setup has the scope arg. TOOWTDI.

* perform setup finalization before reporting failures

* apply modified patches from Andreas Kloeckner to allow
  test functions to have no func_code (#22) and to make
  "-k" and function keywords work  (#20)

* apply patch from Daniel Peolzleithner (issue #23)

* resolve issue #18, multiprocessing.Manager() and
  redirection clash

* make __name__ == "__channelexec__" for remote_exec code

1.0.0b3 (2009-06-19)
====================

* plugin classes are removed: one now defines
  hooks directly in conftest.py or global pytest_*.py
  files.

* added new pytest_namespace(config) hook that allows
  to inject helpers directly to the py.test.* namespace.

* documented and refined many hooks

* added new style of generative tests via
  pytest_generate_tests hook that integrates
  well with function arguments.


1.0.0b1
=======

* introduced new "funcarg" setup method,
  see doc/test/funcarg.txt

* introduced plugin architecture and many
  new py.test plugins, see
  doc/test/plugins.txt

* teardown_method is now guaranteed to get
  called after a test method has run.

* new method: py.test.importorskip(mod,minversion)
  will either import or call py.test.skip()

* completely revised internal py.test architecture

* new py.process.ForkedFunc object allowing to
  fork execution of a function to a sub process
  and getting a result back.

XXX lots of things missing here XXX

0.9.2
=====

* refined installation and metadata, created new setup.py,
  now based on setuptools/ez_setup (thanks to Ralf Schmitt
  for his support).

* improved the way of making py.* scripts available in
  windows environments, they are now added to the
  Scripts directory as ".cmd" files.

* py.path.svnwc.status() now is more complete and
  uses xml output from the 'svn' command if available
  (Guido Wesdorp)

* fix for py.path.svn* to work with svn 1.5
  (Chris Lamb)

* fix path.relto(otherpath) method on windows to
  use normcase for checking if a path is relative.

* py.test's traceback is better parseable from editors
  (follows the filenames:LINENO: MSG convention)
  (thanks to Osmo Salomaa)

* fix to javascript-generation, "py.test --runbrowser"
  should work more reliably now

* removed previously accidentally added
  py.test.broken and py.test.notimplemented helpers.

* there now is a py.__version__ attribute

Deprecations and Removals
=========================

This page lists all pytest features that are currently deprecated or have been removed in past major releases.
The objective is to give users a clear rationale why a certain feature has been removed, and what alternatives
should be used instead.


Deprecated Features
-------------------

Below is a complete list of all pytest features which are considered deprecated. Using those features will issue
:class:`~pytest.PytestWarning` or subclasses, which can be filtered using :ref:`standard warning filters <warnings>`.


.. _sync-test-async-fixture:

sync test depending on async fixture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 8.4

Pytest has for a long time given an error when encountering an asynchronous test function, prompting the user to install
a plugin that can handle it. It has not given any errors if you have an asynchronous fixture that's depended on by a
synchronous test. If the fixture was an async function you did get an "unawaited coroutine" warning, but for async yield fixtures you didn't even get that.
This is a problem even if you do have a plugin installed for handling async tests, as they may require
special decorators for async fixtures to be handled, and some may not robustly handle if a user accidentally requests an
async fixture from their sync tests. Fixture values being cached can make this even more unintuitive, where everything will
"work" if the fixture is first requested by an async test, and then requested by a synchronous test.

Unfortunately there is no 100% reliable method of identifying when a user has made a mistake, versus when they expect an
unawaited object from their fixture that they will handle on their own. To suppress this warning
when you in fact did intend to handle this you can wrap your async fixture in a synchronous fixture:

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture
    async def unawaited_fixture():
        return 1


    def test_foo(unawaited_fixture):
        assert 1 == asyncio.run(unawaited_fixture)

should be changed to


.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture
    def unawaited_fixture():
        async def inner_fixture():
            return 1

        return inner_fixture()


    def test_foo(unawaited_fixture):
        assert 1 == asyncio.run(unawaited_fixture)


You can also make use of `pytest_fixture_setup` to handle the coroutine/asyncgen before pytest sees it - this is the way current async pytest plugins handle it.

If a user has an async fixture with ``autouse=True`` in their ``conftest.py``, or in a file
containing both synchronous tests and the fixture, they will receive this warning.
Unless you're using a plugin that specifically handles async fixtures
with synchronous tests, we strongly recommend against this practice.
It can lead to unpredictable behavior (with larger scopes, it may appear to "work" if an async
test is the first to request the fixture, due to value caching) and will generate
unawaited-coroutine runtime warnings (but only for non-yield fixtures).
Additionally, it creates ambiguity for other developers about whether the fixture is intended to perform
setup for synchronous tests.

The `anyio pytest plugin <https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/testing.html>`_ supports
synchronous tests with async fixtures, though certain limitations apply.


.. _import-or-skip-import-error:

``pytest.importorskip`` default behavior regarding :class:`ImportError`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 8.2

Traditionally :func:`pytest.importorskip` will capture :class:`ImportError`, with the original intent being to skip
tests where a dependent module is not installed, for example testing with different dependencies.

However some packages might be installed in the system, but are not importable due to
some other issue, for example, a compilation error or a broken installation. In those cases :func:`pytest.importorskip`
would still silently skip the test, but more often than not users would like to see the unexpected
error so the underlying issue can be fixed.

In ``8.2`` the ``exc_type`` parameter has been added, giving users the ability of passing :class:`ModuleNotFoundError`
to skip tests only if the module cannot really be found, and not because of some other error.

Catching only :class:`ModuleNotFoundError` by default (and letting other errors propagate) would be the best solution,
however for backward compatibility, pytest will keep the existing behavior but raise an warning if:

1. The captured exception is of type :class:`ImportError`, and:
2. The user does not pass ``exc_type`` explicitly.

If the import attempt raises :class:`ModuleNotFoundError` (the usual case), then the module is skipped and no
warning is emitted.

This way, the usual cases will keep working the same way, while unexpected errors will now issue a warning, with
users being able to suppress the warning by passing ``exc_type=ImportError`` explicitly.

In ``9.0``, the warning will turn into an error, and in ``9.1`` :func:`pytest.importorskip` will only capture
:class:`ModuleNotFoundError` by default and no warnings will be issued anymore -- but users can still capture
:class:`ImportError` by passing it to ``exc_type``.


.. _node-ctor-fspath-deprecation:

``fspath`` argument for Node constructors replaced with ``pathlib.Path``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 7.0

In order to support the transition from ``py.path.local`` to :mod:`pathlib`,
the ``fspath`` argument to :class:`~_pytest.nodes.Node` constructors like
:func:`pytest.Function.from_parent()` and :func:`pytest.Class.from_parent()`
is now deprecated.

Plugins which construct nodes should pass the ``path`` argument, of type
:class:`pathlib.Path`, instead of the ``fspath`` argument.

Plugins which implement custom items and collectors are encouraged to replace
``fspath`` parameters (``py.path.local``) with ``path`` parameters
(``pathlib.Path``), and drop any other usage of the ``py`` library if possible.

If possible, plugins with custom items should use :ref:`cooperative
constructors <uncooperative-constructors-deprecated>` to avoid hardcoding
arguments they only pass on to the superclass.

.. note::
    The name of the :class:`~_pytest.nodes.Node` arguments and attributes (the
    new attribute being ``path``) is **the opposite** of the situation for
    hooks, :ref:`outlined below <legacy-path-hooks-deprecated>` (the old
    argument being ``path``).

    This is an unfortunate artifact due to historical reasons, which should be
    resolved in future versions as we slowly get rid of the :pypi:`py`
    dependency (see :issue:`9283` for a longer discussion).

Due to the ongoing migration of methods like :meth:`~pytest.Item.reportinfo`
which still is expected to return a ``py.path.local`` object, nodes still have
both ``fspath`` (``py.path.local``) and ``path`` (``pathlib.Path``) attributes,
no matter what argument was used in the constructor. We expect to deprecate the
``fspath`` attribute in a future release.


Configuring hook specs/impls using markers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before pluggy, pytest's plugin library, was its own package and had a clear API,
pytest just used ``pytest.mark`` to configure hooks.

The :py:func:`pytest.hookimpl` and :py:func:`pytest.hookspec` decorators
have been available since years and should be used instead.

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.tryfirst
    def pytest_runtest_call(): ...


    # or
    def pytest_runtest_call(): ...


    pytest_runtest_call.tryfirst = True

should be changed to:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.hookimpl(tryfirst=True)
    def pytest_runtest_call(): ...

Changed ``hookimpl`` attributes:

* ``tryfirst``
* ``trylast``
* ``optionalhook``
* ``hookwrapper``

Changed ``hookwrapper`` attributes:

* ``firstresult``
* ``historic``


.. _legacy-path-hooks-deprecated:

``py.path.local`` arguments for hooks replaced with ``pathlib.Path``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 7.0

In order to support the transition from ``py.path.local`` to :mod:`pathlib`, the following hooks now receive additional arguments:

*  :hook:`pytest_ignore_collect(collection_path: pathlib.Path) <pytest_ignore_collect>` as equivalent to ``path``
*  :hook:`pytest_collect_file(file_path: pathlib.Path) <pytest_collect_file>` as equivalent to ``path``
*  :hook:`pytest_pycollect_makemodule(module_path: pathlib.Path) <pytest_pycollect_makemodule>` as equivalent to ``path``
*  :hook:`pytest_report_header(start_path: pathlib.Path) <pytest_report_header>` as equivalent to ``startdir``
*  :hook:`pytest_report_collectionfinish(start_path: pathlib.Path) <pytest_report_collectionfinish>` as equivalent to ``startdir``

The accompanying ``py.path.local`` based paths have been deprecated: plugins which manually invoke those hooks should only pass the new ``pathlib.Path`` arguments, and users should change their hook implementations to use the new ``pathlib.Path`` arguments.

.. note::
    The name of the :class:`~_pytest.nodes.Node` arguments and attributes,
    :ref:`outlined above <node-ctor-fspath-deprecation>` (the new attribute
    being ``path``) is **the opposite** of the situation for hooks (the old
    argument being ``path``).

    This is an unfortunate artifact due to historical reasons, which should be
    resolved in future versions as we slowly get rid of the :pypi:`py`
    dependency (see :issue:`9283` for a longer discussion).

Directly constructing internal classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 7.0

Directly constructing the following classes is now deprecated:

- ``_pytest.mark.structures.Mark``
- ``_pytest.mark.structures.MarkDecorator``
- ``_pytest.mark.structures.MarkGenerator``
- ``_pytest.python.Metafunc``
- ``_pytest.runner.CallInfo``
- ``_pytest._code.ExceptionInfo``
- ``_pytest.config.argparsing.Parser``
- ``_pytest.config.argparsing.OptionGroup``
- ``_pytest.pytester.HookRecorder``

These constructors have always been considered private, but now issue a deprecation warning, which may become a hard error in pytest 8.

.. _diamond-inheritance-deprecated:

Diamond inheritance between :class:`pytest.Collector` and :class:`pytest.Item`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 7.0

Defining a custom pytest node type which is both an :class:`~pytest.Item` and a :class:`~pytest.Collector` (e.g. :class:`~pytest.File`) now issues a warning.
It was never sanely supported and triggers hard to debug errors.

Some plugins providing linting/code analysis have been using this as a hack.
Instead, a separate collector node should be used, which collects the item. See
:ref:`non-python tests` for an example, as well as an `example pr fixing inheritance`_.

.. _example pr fixing inheritance: https://github.com/asmeurer/pytest-flakes/pull/40/files


.. _uncooperative-constructors-deprecated:

Constructors of custom :class:`~_pytest.nodes.Node` subclasses should take ``**kwargs``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 7.0

If custom subclasses of nodes like :class:`pytest.Item` override the
``__init__`` method, they should take ``**kwargs``. Thus,

.. code-block:: python

    class CustomItem(pytest.Item):
        def __init__(self, name, parent, additional_arg):
            super().__init__(name, parent)
            self.additional_arg = additional_arg

should be turned into:

.. code-block:: python

    class CustomItem(pytest.Item):
        def __init__(self, *, additional_arg, **kwargs):
            super().__init__(**kwargs)
            self.additional_arg = additional_arg

to avoid hard-coding the arguments pytest can pass to the superclass.
See :ref:`non-python tests` for a full example.

For cases without conflicts, no deprecation warning is emitted. For cases with
conflicts (such as :class:`pytest.File` now taking ``path`` instead of
``fspath``, as :ref:`outlined above <node-ctor-fspath-deprecation>`), a
deprecation warning is now raised.

Applying a mark to a fixture function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 7.4

Applying a mark to a fixture function never had any effect, but it is a common user error.

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.usefixtures("clean_database")
    @pytest.fixture
    def user() -> User: ...

Users expected in this case that the ``usefixtures`` mark would have its intended effect of using the ``clean_database`` fixture when ``user`` was invoked, when in fact it has no effect at all.

Now pytest will issue a warning when it encounters this problem, and will raise an error in the future versions.


The ``yield_fixture`` function/decorator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 6.2

``pytest.yield_fixture`` is a deprecated alias for :func:`pytest.fixture`.

It has been so for a very long time, so can be search/replaced safely.


Removed Features and Breaking Changes
-------------------------------------

As stated in our :ref:`backwards-compatibility` policy, deprecated features are removed only in major releases after
an appropriate period of deprecation has passed.

Some breaking changes which could not be deprecated are also listed.

.. _yield tests deprecated:

``yield`` tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 4.0

    ``yield`` tests ``xfail``.

.. versionremoved:: 8.4

    ``yield`` tests raise a collection error.

pytest no longer supports ``yield``-style tests, where a test function actually ``yield`` functions and values
that are then turned into proper test methods. Example:

.. code-block:: python

    def check(x, y):
        assert x**x == y


    def test_squared():
        yield check, 2, 4
        yield check, 3, 9

This would result in two actual test functions being generated.

This form of test function doesn't support fixtures properly, and users should switch to ``pytest.mark.parametrize``:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.parametrize("x, y", [(2, 4), (3, 9)])
    def test_squared(x, y):
        assert x**x == y

.. _nose-deprecation:

Support for tests written for nose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 7.2
.. versionremoved:: 8.0

Support for running tests written for `nose <https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ is now deprecated.

``nose`` has been in maintenance mode-only for years, and maintaining the plugin is not trivial as it spills
over the code base (see :issue:`9886` for more details).

setup/teardown
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One thing that might catch users by surprise is that plain ``setup`` and ``teardown`` methods are not pytest native,
they are in fact part of the ``nose`` support.


.. code-block:: python

    class Test:
        def setup(self):
            self.resource = make_resource()

        def teardown(self):
            self.resource.close()

        def test_foo(self): ...

        def test_bar(self): ...



Native pytest support uses ``setup_method`` and ``teardown_method`` (see :ref:`xunit-method-setup`), so the above should be changed to:

.. code-block:: python

    class Test:
        def setup_method(self):
            self.resource = make_resource()

        def teardown_method(self):
            self.resource.close()

        def test_foo(self): ...

        def test_bar(self): ...


This is easy to do in an entire code base by doing a simple find/replace.

@with_setup
^^^^^^^^^^^

Code using `@with_setup <with-setup-nose>`_ such as this:

.. code-block:: python

    from nose.tools import with_setup


    def setup_some_resource(): ...


    def teardown_some_resource(): ...


    @with_setup(setup_some_resource, teardown_some_resource)
    def test_foo(): ...

Will also need to be ported to a supported pytest style. One way to do it is using a fixture:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    def setup_some_resource(): ...


    def teardown_some_resource(): ...


    @pytest.fixture
    def some_resource():
        setup_some_resource()
        yield
        teardown_some_resource()


    def test_foo(some_resource): ...


.. _`with-setup-nose`: https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing_tools.html?highlight=with_setup#nose.tools.with_setup


The ``compat_co_firstlineno`` attribute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nose inspects this attribute on function objects to allow overriding the function's inferred line number.
Pytest no longer respects this attribute.



Passing ``msg=`` to ``pytest.skip``, ``pytest.fail`` or ``pytest.exit``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 7.0
.. versionremoved:: 8.0

Passing the keyword argument ``msg`` to :func:`pytest.skip`, :func:`pytest.fail` or :func:`pytest.exit`
is now deprecated and ``reason`` should be used instead.  This change is to bring consistency between these
functions and the ``@pytest.mark.skip`` and ``@pytest.mark.xfail`` markers which already accept a ``reason`` argument.

.. code-block:: python

    def test_fail_example():
        # old
        pytest.fail(msg="foo")
        # new
        pytest.fail(reason="bar")


    def test_skip_example():
        # old
        pytest.skip(msg="foo")
        # new
        pytest.skip(reason="bar")


    def test_exit_example():
        # old
        pytest.exit(msg="foo")
        # new
        pytest.exit(reason="bar")


.. _instance-collector-deprecation:

The ``pytest.Instance`` collector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 7.0

The ``pytest.Instance`` collector type has been removed.

Previously, Python test methods were collected as :class:`~pytest.Class` -> ``Instance`` -> :class:`~pytest.Function`.
Now :class:`~pytest.Class` collects the test methods directly.

Most plugins which reference ``Instance`` do so in order to ignore or skip it,
using a check such as ``if isinstance(node, Instance): return``.
Such plugins should simply remove consideration of ``Instance`` on pytest>=7.
However, to keep such uses working, a dummy type has been instanced in ``pytest.Instance`` and ``_pytest.python.Instance``,
and importing it emits a deprecation warning. This was removed in pytest 8.


Using ``pytest.warns(None)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 7.0
.. versionremoved:: 8.0

:func:`pytest.warns(None) <pytest.warns>` is now deprecated because it was frequently misused.
Its correct usage was checking that the code emits at least one warning of any type - like ``pytest.warns()``
or ``pytest.warns(Warning)``.

See :ref:`warns use cases` for examples.


Backward compatibilities in ``Parser.addoption``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 2.4
.. versionremoved:: 8.0

Several behaviors of :meth:`Parser.addoption <pytest.Parser.addoption>` are now
removed in pytest 8 (deprecated since pytest 2.4.0):

- ``parser.addoption(..., help=".. %default ..")`` - use ``%(default)s`` instead.
- ``parser.addoption(..., type="int/string/float/complex")`` - use ``type=int`` etc. instead.


The ``--strict`` command-line option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 6.2
.. versionremoved:: 8.0

The ``--strict`` command-line option has been deprecated in favor of ``--strict-markers``, which
better conveys what the option does.

We have plans to maybe in the future to reintroduce ``--strict`` and make it an encompassing
flag for all strictness related options (``--strict-markers`` and ``--strict-config``
at the moment, more might be introduced in the future).


.. _cmdline-preparse-deprecated:

Implementing the ``pytest_cmdline_preparse`` hook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 7.0
.. versionremoved:: 8.0

Implementing the ``pytest_cmdline_preparse`` hook has been officially deprecated.
Implement the :hook:`pytest_load_initial_conftests` hook instead.

.. code-block:: python

    def pytest_cmdline_preparse(config: Config, args: List[str]) -> None: ...


    # becomes:


    def pytest_load_initial_conftests(
        early_config: Config, parser: Parser, args: List[str]
    ) -> None: ...


Collection changes in pytest 8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added a new :class:`pytest.Directory` base collection node, which all collector nodes for filesystem directories are expected to subclass.
This is analogous to the existing :class:`pytest.File` for file nodes.

Changed :class:`pytest.Package` to be a subclass of :class:`pytest.Directory`.
A ``Package`` represents a filesystem directory which is a Python package,
i.e. contains an ``__init__.py`` file.

:class:`pytest.Package` now only collects files in its own directory; previously it collected recursively.
Sub-directories are collected as sub-collector nodes, thus creating a collection tree which mirrors the filesystem hierarchy.

:attr:`session.name <pytest.Session.name>` is now ``""``; previously it was the rootdir directory name.
This matches :attr:`session.nodeid <_pytest.nodes.Node.nodeid>` which has always been `""`.

Added a new :class:`pytest.Dir` concrete collection node, a subclass of :class:`pytest.Directory`.
This node represents a filesystem directory, which is not a :class:`pytest.Package`,
i.e. does not contain an ``__init__.py`` file.
Similarly to ``Package``, it only collects the files in its own directory,
while collecting sub-directories as sub-collector nodes.

Files and directories are now collected in alphabetical order jointly, unless changed by a plugin.
Previously, files were collected before directories.

The collection tree now contains directories/packages up to the :ref:`rootdir <rootdir>`,
for initial arguments that are found within the rootdir.
For files outside the rootdir, only the immediate directory/package is collected --
note however that collecting from outside the rootdir is discouraged.

As an example, given the following filesystem tree::

    myroot/
        pytest.ini
        top/
        ├── aaa
        │   └── test_aaa.py
        ├── test_a.py
        ├── test_b
        │   ├── __init__.py
        │   └── test_b.py
        ├── test_c.py
        └── zzz
            ├── __init__.py
            └── test_zzz.py

the collection tree, as shown by `pytest --collect-only top/` but with the otherwise-hidden :class:`~pytest.Session` node added for clarity,
is now the following::

    <Session>
      <Dir myroot>
        <Dir top>
          <Dir aaa>
            <Module test_aaa.py>
              <Function test_it>
          <Module test_a.py>
            <Function test_it>
          <Package test_b>
            <Module test_b.py>
              <Function test_it>
          <Module test_c.py>
            <Function test_it>
          <Package zzz>
            <Module test_zzz.py>
              <Function test_it>

Previously, it was::

    <Session>
      <Module top/test_a.py>
        <Function test_it>
      <Module top/test_c.py>
        <Function test_it>
      <Module top/aaa/test_aaa.py>
        <Function test_it>
      <Package test_b>
        <Module test_b.py>
          <Function test_it>
      <Package zzz>
        <Module test_zzz.py>
          <Function test_it>

Code/plugins which rely on a specific shape of the collection tree might need to update.


:class:`pytest.Package` is no longer a :class:`pytest.Module` or :class:`pytest.File`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 8.0

The ``Package`` collector node designates a Python package, that is, a directory with an `__init__.py` file.
Previously ``Package`` was a subtype of ``pytest.Module`` (which represents a single Python module),
the module being the `__init__.py` file.
This has been deemed a design mistake (see :issue:`11137` and :issue:`7777` for details).

The ``path`` property of ``Package`` nodes now points to the package directory instead of the ``__init__.py`` file.

Note that a ``Module`` node for ``__init__.py`` (which is not a ``Package``) may still exist,
if it is picked up during collection (e.g. if you configured :confval:`python_files` to include ``__init__.py`` files).


Collecting ``__init__.py`` files no longer collects package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 8.0

Running `pytest pkg/__init__.py` now collects the `pkg/__init__.py` file (module) only.
Previously, it collected the entire `pkg` package, including other test files in the directory, but excluding tests in the `__init__.py` file itself
(unless :confval:`python_files` was changed to allow `__init__.py` file).

To collect the entire package, specify just the directory: `pytest pkg`.


The ``pytest.collect`` module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 6.0
.. versionremoved:: 7.0

The ``pytest.collect`` module is no longer part of the public API, all its names
should now be imported from ``pytest`` directly instead.



The ``pytest_warning_captured`` hook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 6.0
.. versionremoved:: 7.0

This hook has an `item` parameter which cannot be serialized by ``pytest-xdist``.

Use the ``pytest_warning_recorded`` hook instead, which replaces the ``item`` parameter
by a ``nodeid`` parameter.



The ``pytest._fillfuncargs`` function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 6.0
.. versionremoved:: 7.0

This function was kept for backward compatibility with an older plugin.

It's functionality is not meant to be used directly, but if you must replace
it, use `function._request._fillfixtures()` instead, though note this is not
a public API and may break in the future.


``--no-print-logs`` command-line option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 5.4
.. versionremoved:: 6.0


The ``--no-print-logs`` option and ``log_print`` ini setting are removed. If
you used them, please use ``--show-capture`` instead.

A ``--show-capture`` command-line option was added in ``pytest 3.5.0`` which allows to specify how to
display captured output when tests fail: ``no``, ``stdout``, ``stderr``, ``log`` or ``all`` (the default).


.. _resultlog deprecated:

Result log (``--result-log``)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 4.0
.. versionremoved:: 6.0

The ``--result-log`` option produces a stream of test reports which can be
analysed at runtime, but it uses a custom format which requires users to implement their own
parser.

The  `pytest-reportlog <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-reportlog>`__ plugin provides a ``--report-log`` option, a more standard and extensible alternative, producing
one JSON object per-line, and should cover the same use cases. Please try it out and provide feedback.

The ``pytest-reportlog`` plugin might even be merged into the core
at some point, depending on the plans for the plugins and number of users using it.

``pytest_collect_directory`` hook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 6.0

The ``pytest_collect_directory`` hook has not worked properly for years (it was called
but the results were ignored). Users may consider using :hook:`pytest_collection_modifyitems` instead.

TerminalReporter.writer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 6.0

The ``TerminalReporter.writer`` attribute has been deprecated and should no longer be used. This
was inadvertently exposed as part of the public API of that plugin and ties it too much
with ``py.io.TerminalWriter``.

Plugins that used ``TerminalReporter.writer`` directly should instead use ``TerminalReporter``
methods that provide the same functionality.

.. _junit-family changed default value:

``junit_family`` default value change to "xunit2"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 6.0

The default value of ``junit_family`` option will change to ``xunit2`` in pytest 6.0, which
is an update of the old ``xunit1`` format and is supported by default in modern tools
that manipulate this type of file (for example, Jenkins, Azure Pipelines, etc.).

Users are recommended to try the new ``xunit2`` format and see if their tooling that consumes the JUnit
XML file supports it.

To use the new format, update your ``pytest.ini``:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    junit_family=xunit2

If you discover that your tooling does not support the new format, and want to keep using the
legacy version, set the option to ``legacy`` instead:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    junit_family=legacy

By using ``legacy`` you will keep using the legacy/xunit1 format when upgrading to
pytest 6.0, where the default format will be ``xunit2``.

In order to let users know about the transition, pytest will issue a warning in case
the ``--junit-xml`` option is given in the command line but ``junit_family`` is not explicitly
configured in ``pytest.ini``.

Services known to support the ``xunit2`` format:

* `Jenkins <https://www.jenkins.io/>`__ with the `JUnit <https://plugins.jenkins.io/junit>`__ plugin.
* `Azure Pipelines <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines>`__.

Node Construction changed to ``Node.from_parent``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 6.0

The construction of nodes now should use the named constructor ``from_parent``.
This limitation in api surface intends to enable better/simpler refactoring of the collection tree.

This means that instead of :code:`MyItem(name="foo", parent=collector, obj=42)`
one now has to invoke :code:`MyItem.from_parent(collector, name="foo")`.

Plugins that wish to support older versions of pytest and suppress the warning can use
`hasattr` to check if `from_parent` exists in that version:

.. code-block:: python

    def pytest_pycollect_makeitem(collector, name, obj):
        if hasattr(MyItem, "from_parent"):
            item = MyItem.from_parent(collector, name="foo")
            item.obj = 42
            return item
        else:
            return MyItem(name="foo", parent=collector, obj=42)

Note that ``from_parent`` should only be called with keyword arguments for the parameters.


``pytest.fixture`` arguments are keyword only
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 6.0

Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments has been removed - pass them by keyword instead.

``funcargnames`` alias for ``fixturenames``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 6.0

The ``FixtureRequest``, ``Metafunc``, and ``Function`` classes track the names of
their associated fixtures, with the aptly-named ``fixturenames`` attribute.

Prior to pytest 2.3, this attribute was named ``funcargnames``, and we have kept
that as an alias since.  It is finally due for removal, as it is often confusing
in places where we or plugin authors must distinguish between fixture names and
names supplied by non-fixture things such as ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


.. _pytest.config global deprecated:

``pytest.config`` global
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 5.0

The ``pytest.config`` global object is deprecated.  Instead use
``request.config`` (via the ``request`` fixture) or if you are a plugin author
use the ``pytest_configure(config)`` hook. Note that many hooks can also access
the ``config`` object indirectly, through ``session.config`` or ``item.config`` for example.


.. _`raises message deprecated`:

``"message"`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 5.0

It is a common mistake to think this parameter will match the exception message, while in fact
it only serves to provide a custom message in case the ``pytest.raises`` check fails. To prevent
users from making this mistake, and because it is believed to be little used, pytest is
deprecating it without providing an alternative for the moment.

If you have a valid use case for this parameter, consider that to obtain the same results
you can just call ``pytest.fail`` manually at the end of the ``with`` statement.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    with pytest.raises(TimeoutError, message="Client got unexpected message"):
        wait_for(websocket.recv(), 0.5)


Becomes:

.. code-block:: python

    with pytest.raises(TimeoutError):
        wait_for(websocket.recv(), 0.5)
        pytest.fail("Client got unexpected message")


If you still have concerns about this deprecation and future removal, please comment on
:issue:`3974`.


.. _raises-warns-exec:

``raises`` / ``warns`` with a string as the second argument
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 5.0

Use the context manager form of these instead.  When necessary, invoke ``exec``
directly.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError, "1 / 0")
    pytest.raises(SyntaxError, "a $ b")

    pytest.warns(DeprecationWarning, "my_function()")
    pytest.warns(SyntaxWarning, "assert(1, 2)")

Becomes:

.. code-block:: python

    with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):
        1 / 0
    with pytest.raises(SyntaxError):
        exec("a $ b")  # exec is required for invalid syntax

    with pytest.warns(DeprecationWarning):
        my_function()
    with pytest.warns(SyntaxWarning):
        exec("assert(1, 2)")  # exec is used to avoid a top-level warning




Using ``Class`` in custom Collectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 4.0

Using objects named ``"Class"`` as a way to customize the type of nodes that are collected in ``Collector``
subclasses has been deprecated. Users instead should use ``pytest_pycollect_makeitem`` to customize node types during
collection.

This issue should affect only advanced plugins who create new collection types, so if you see this warning
message please contact the authors so they can change the code.


.. _marks in pytest.parametrize deprecated:

marks in ``pytest.mark.parametrize``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 4.0

Applying marks to values of a ``pytest.mark.parametrize`` call is now deprecated. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.parametrize(
        "a, b",
        [
            (3, 9),
            pytest.mark.xfail(reason="flaky")(6, 36),
            (10, 100),
            (20, 200),
            (40, 400),
            (50, 500),
        ],
    )
    def test_foo(a, b): ...

This code applies the ``pytest.mark.xfail(reason="flaky")`` mark to the ``(6, 36)`` value of the above parametrization
call.

This was considered hard to read and understand, and also its implementation presented problems to the code preventing
further internal improvements in the marks architecture.

To update the code, use ``pytest.param``:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.parametrize(
        "a, b",
        [
            (3, 9),
            pytest.param(6, 36, marks=pytest.mark.xfail(reason="flaky")),
            (10, 100),
            (20, 200),
            (40, 400),
            (50, 500),
        ],
    )
    def test_foo(a, b): ...


.. _pytest_funcarg__ prefix deprecated:

``pytest_funcarg__`` prefix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 4.0

In very early pytest versions fixtures could be defined using the ``pytest_funcarg__`` prefix:

.. code-block:: python

    def pytest_funcarg__data():
        return SomeData()

Switch over to the ``@pytest.fixture`` decorator:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture
    def data():
        return SomeData()



[pytest] section in setup.cfg files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 4.0

``[pytest]`` sections in ``setup.cfg`` files should now be named ``[tool:pytest]``
to avoid conflicts with other distutils commands.


.. _metafunc.addcall deprecated:

Metafunc.addcall
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 4.0

``Metafunc.addcall`` was a precursor to the current parametrized mechanism. Users should use
:meth:`pytest.Metafunc.parametrize` instead.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):
        metafunc.addcall({"i": 1}, id="1")
        metafunc.addcall({"i": 2}, id="2")

Becomes:

.. code-block:: python

    def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):
        metafunc.parametrize("i", [1, 2], ids=["1", "2"])


.. _cached_setup deprecated:

``cached_setup``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 4.0

``request.cached_setup`` was the precursor of the setup/teardown mechanism available to fixtures.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture
    def db_session():
        return request.cached_setup(
            setup=Session.create, teardown=lambda session: session.close(), scope="module"
        )

This should be updated to make use of standard fixture mechanisms:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture(scope="module")
    def db_session():
        session = Session.create()
        yield session
        session.close()


You can consult :std:doc:`funcarg comparison section in the docs <funcarg_compare>` for
more information.


.. _pytest_plugins in non-top-level conftest files deprecated:

pytest_plugins in non-top-level conftest files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 4.0

Defining :globalvar:`pytest_plugins` is now deprecated in non-top-level conftest.py
files because they will activate referenced plugins *globally*, which is surprising because for all other pytest
features ``conftest.py`` files are only *active* for tests at or below it.


.. _config.warn and node.warn deprecated:

``Config.warn`` and ``Node.warn``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 4.0

Those methods were part of the internal pytest warnings system, but since ``3.8`` pytest is using the builtin warning
system for its own warnings, so those two functions are now deprecated.

``Config.warn`` should be replaced by calls to the standard ``warnings.warn``, example:

.. code-block:: python

    config.warn("C1", "some warning")

Becomes:

.. code-block:: python

    warnings.warn(pytest.PytestWarning("some warning"))

``Node.warn`` now supports two signatures:

* ``node.warn(PytestWarning("some message"))``: is now the **recommended** way to call this function.
  The warning instance must be a PytestWarning or subclass.

* ``node.warn("CI", "some message")``: this code/message form has been **removed** and should be converted to the warning instance form above.

.. _record_xml_property deprecated:

record_xml_property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 4.0

The ``record_xml_property`` fixture is now deprecated in favor of the more generic ``record_property``, which
can be used by other consumers (for example ``pytest-html``) to obtain custom information about the test run.

This is just a matter of renaming the fixture as the API is the same:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_foo(record_xml_property): ...

Change to:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_foo(record_property): ...


.. _passing command-line string to pytest.main deprecated:

Passing command-line string to ``pytest.main()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 4.0

Passing a command-line string to ``pytest.main()`` is deprecated:

.. code-block:: python

    pytest.main("-v -s")

Pass a list instead:

.. code-block:: python

    pytest.main(["-v", "-s"])


By passing a string, users expect that pytest will interpret that command-line using the shell rules they are working
on (for example ``bash`` or ``Powershell``), but this is very hard/impossible to do in a portable way.


.. _calling fixtures directly deprecated:

Calling fixtures directly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 4.0

Calling a fixture function directly, as opposed to request them in a test function, is deprecated.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture
    def cell():
        return ...


    @pytest.fixture
    def full_cell():
        cell = cell()
        cell.make_full()
        return cell

This is a great source of confusion to new users, which will often call the fixture functions and request them from test functions interchangeably, which breaks the fixture resolution model.

In those cases just request the function directly in the dependent fixture:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture
    def cell():
        return ...


    @pytest.fixture
    def full_cell(cell):
        cell.make_full()
        return cell

Alternatively if the fixture function is called multiple times inside a test (making it hard to apply the above pattern) or
if you would like to make minimal changes to the code, you can create a fixture which calls the original function together
with the ``name`` parameter:

.. code-block:: python

    def cell():
        return ...


    @pytest.fixture(name="cell")
    def cell_fixture():
        return cell()


.. _internal classes accessed through node deprecated:

Internal classes accessed through ``Node``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 4.0

Access of ``Module``, ``Function``, ``Class``, ``Instance``, ``File`` and ``Item`` through ``Node`` instances now issue
this warning:

.. code-block:: text

    usage of Function.Module is deprecated, please use pytest.Module instead

Users should just ``import pytest`` and access those objects using the ``pytest`` module.

This has been documented as deprecated for years, but only now we are actually emitting deprecation warnings.

``Node.get_marker``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 4.0

As part of a large :ref:`marker-revamp`, ``_pytest.nodes.Node.get_marker`` is removed. See
:ref:`the documentation <update marker code>` on tips on how to update your code.


``somefunction.markname``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 4.0

As part of a large :ref:`marker-revamp` we already deprecated using ``MarkInfo``
the only correct way to get markers of an element is via ``node.iter_markers(name)``.


.. _pytest.namespace deprecated:

``pytest_namespace``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionremoved:: 4.0

This hook is deprecated because it greatly complicates the pytest internals regarding configuration and initialization, making some
bug fixes and refactorings impossible.

Example of usage:

.. code-block:: python

    class MySymbol: ...


    def pytest_namespace():
        return {"my_symbol": MySymbol()}


Plugin authors relying on this hook should instead require that users now import the plugin modules directly (with an appropriate public API).

As a stopgap measure, plugin authors may still inject their names into pytest's namespace, usually during ``pytest_configure``:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    def pytest_configure():
        pytest.my_symbol = MySymbol()

.. _`funcargcompare`:

pytest-2.3: reasoning for fixture/funcarg evolution
=============================================================

**Target audience**: Reading this document requires basic knowledge of
python testing, xUnit setup methods and the (previous) basic pytest
funcarg mechanism, see :ref:`historical funcargs and pytest.funcargs`.
If you are new to pytest, then you can simply ignore this
section and read the other sections.

Shortcomings of the previous ``pytest_funcarg__`` mechanism
--------------------------------------------------------------

The pre pytest-2.3 funcarg mechanism calls a factory each time a
funcarg for a test function is required.  If a factory wants to
reuse a resource across different scopes, it often used
the ``request.cached_setup()`` helper to manage caching of
resources.  Here is a basic example how we could implement
a per-session Database object:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py
    class Database:
        def __init__(self):
            print("database instance created")

        def destroy(self):
            print("database instance destroyed")


    def pytest_funcarg__db(request):
        return request.cached_setup(
            setup=DataBase, teardown=lambda db: db.destroy, scope="session"
        )

There are several limitations and difficulties with this approach:

1. Scoping funcarg resource creation is not straight forward, instead one must
   understand the intricate cached_setup() method mechanics.

2. parametrizing the "db" resource is not straight forward:
   you need to apply a "parametrize" decorator or implement a
   :hook:`pytest_generate_tests` hook
   calling :py:func:`~pytest.Metafunc.parametrize` which
   performs parametrization at the places where the resource
   is used.  Moreover, you need to modify the factory to use an
   ``extrakey`` parameter containing ``request.param`` to the
   ``Request.cached_setup`` call.

3. Multiple parametrized session-scoped resources will be active
   at the same time, making it hard for them to affect global state
   of the application under test.

4. there is no way how you can make use of funcarg factories
   in xUnit setup methods.

5. A non-parametrized fixture function cannot use a parametrized
   funcarg resource if it isn't stated in the test function signature.

All of these limitations are addressed with pytest-2.3 and its
improved :ref:`fixture mechanism <fixture>`.


Direct scoping of fixture/funcarg factories
--------------------------------------------------------

Instead of calling cached_setup() with a cache scope, you can use the
:ref:`@pytest.fixture <pytest.fixture>` decorator and directly state
the scope:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
    def db(request):
        # factory will only be invoked once per session -
        db = DataBase()
        request.addfinalizer(db.destroy)  # destroy when session is finished
        return db

This factory implementation does not need to call ``cached_setup()`` anymore
because it will only be invoked once per session.  Moreover, the
``request.addfinalizer()`` registers a finalizer according to the specified
resource scope on which the factory function is operating.


Direct parametrization of funcarg resource factories
----------------------------------------------------------

Previously, funcarg factories could not directly cause parametrization.
You needed to specify a ``@parametrize`` decorator on your test function
or implement a :hook:`pytest_generate_tests` hook to perform
parametrization, i.e. calling a test multiple times with different value
sets.  pytest-2.3 introduces a decorator for use on the factory itself:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture(params=["mysql", "pg"])
    def db(request): ...  # use request.param

Here the factory will be invoked twice (with the respective "mysql"
and "pg" values set as ``request.param`` attributes) and all of
the tests requiring "db" will run twice as well.  The "mysql" and
"pg" values will also be used for reporting the test-invocation variants.

This new way of parametrizing funcarg factories should in many cases
allow to reuse already written factories because effectively
``request.param`` was already used when test functions/classes were
parametrized via
:py:func:`metafunc.parametrize(indirect=True) <pytest.Metafunc.parametrize>` calls.

Of course it's perfectly fine to combine parametrization and scoping:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture(scope="session", params=["mysql", "pg"])
    def db(request):
        if request.param == "mysql":
            db = MySQL()
        elif request.param == "pg":
            db = PG()
        request.addfinalizer(db.destroy)  # destroy when session is finished
        return db

This would execute all tests requiring the per-session "db" resource twice,
receiving the values created by the two respective invocations to the
factory function.


No ``pytest_funcarg__`` prefix when using @fixture decorator
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When using the ``@fixture`` decorator the name of the function
denotes the name under which the resource can be accessed as a function
argument:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture()
    def db(request): ...

The name under which the funcarg resource can be requested is ``db``.

You can still use the "old" non-decorator way of specifying funcarg factories
aka:

.. code-block:: python

    def pytest_funcarg__db(request): ...


But it is then not possible to define scoping and parametrization.
It is thus recommended to use the factory decorator.


solving per-session setup / autouse fixtures
--------------------------------------------------------------

pytest for a long time offered a pytest_configure and a pytest_sessionstart
hook which are often used to setup global resources.  This suffers from
several problems:

1. in distributed testing the managing process would setup test resources
   that are never needed because it only coordinates the test run
   activities of the worker processes.

2. if you only perform a collection (with "--collect-only")
   resource-setup will still be executed.

3. If a pytest_sessionstart is contained in some subdirectories
   conftest.py file, it will not be called.  This stems from the
   fact that this hook is actually used for reporting, in particular
   the test-header with platform/custom information.

Moreover, it was not easy to define a scoped setup from plugins or
conftest files other than to implement a ``pytest_runtest_setup()`` hook
and caring for scoping/caching yourself.  And it's virtually impossible
to do this with parametrization as ``pytest_runtest_setup()`` is called
during test execution and parametrization happens at collection time.

It follows that pytest_configure/session/runtest_setup are often not
appropriate for implementing common fixture needs.  Therefore,
pytest-2.3 introduces :ref:`autouse fixtures` which fully
integrate with the generic :ref:`fixture mechanism <fixture>`
and obsolete many prior uses of pytest hooks.

funcargs/fixture discovery now happens at collection time
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Since pytest-2.3, discovery of fixture/funcarg factories are taken care of
at collection time.  This is more efficient especially for large test suites.
Moreover, a call to "pytest --collect-only" should be able to in the future
show a lot of setup-information and thus presents a nice method to get an
overview of fixture management in your project.

Conclusion and compatibility notes
---------------------------------------------------------

**funcargs** were originally introduced to pytest-2.0.  In pytest-2.3
the mechanism was extended and refined and is now described as
fixtures:

* previously funcarg factories were specified with a special
  ``pytest_funcarg__NAME`` prefix instead of using the
  ``@pytest.fixture`` decorator.

* Factories received a ``request`` object which managed caching through
  ``request.cached_setup()`` calls and allowed using other funcargs via
  ``request.getfuncargvalue()`` calls.  These intricate APIs made it hard
  to do proper parametrization and implement resource caching. The
  new :py:func:`pytest.fixture` decorator allows to declare the scope
  and let pytest figure things out for you.

* if you used parametrization and funcarg factories which made use of
  ``request.cached_setup()`` it is recommended to invest a few minutes
  and simplify your fixture function code to use the :ref:`@pytest.fixture`
  decorator instead.  This will also allow to take advantage of
  the automatic per-resource grouping of tests.

.. _get-started:

Get Started
===================================

.. _`getstarted`:
.. _`installation`:

Install ``pytest``
----------------------------------------

``pytest`` requires: Python 3.8+ or PyPy3.

1. Run the following command in your command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U pytest

2. Check that you installed the correct version:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pytest --version
    pytest 8.4.1

.. _`simpletest`:

Create your first test
----------------------------------------------------------

Create a new file called ``test_sample.py``, containing a function, and a test:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_sample.py
    def func(x):
        return x + 1


    def test_answer():
        assert func(3) == 5

The test

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 1 item

    test_sample.py F                                                     [100%]

    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    _______________________________ test_answer ________________________________

        def test_answer():
    >       assert func(3) == 5
    E       assert 4 == 5
    E        +  where 4 = func(3)

    test_sample.py:6: AssertionError
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_sample.py::test_answer - assert 4 == 5
    ============================ 1 failed in 0.12s =============================

The ``[100%]`` refers to the overall progress of running all test cases. After it finishes, pytest then shows a failure report because ``func(3)`` does not return ``5``.

.. note::

    You can use the ``assert`` statement to verify test expectations. pytest’s :ref:`Advanced assertion introspection <python:assert>` will intelligently report intermediate values of the assert expression so you can avoid the many names :ref:`of JUnit legacy methods <testcase-objects>`.

Run multiple tests
----------------------------------------------------------

``pytest`` will run all files of the form test_*.py or \*_test.py in the current directory and its subdirectories. More generally, it follows :ref:`standard test discovery rules <test discovery>`.


Assert that a certain exception is raised
--------------------------------------------------------------

Use the :ref:`raises <assertraises>` helper to assert that some code raises an exception:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_sysexit.py
    import pytest


    def f():
        raise SystemExit(1)


    def test_mytest():
        with pytest.raises(SystemExit):
            f()

Execute the test function with “quiet” reporting mode:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q test_sysexit.py
    .                                                                    [100%]
    1 passed in 0.12s

.. note::

    The ``-q/--quiet`` flag keeps the output brief in this and following examples.

See :ref:`assertraises` for specifying more details about the expected exception.

Group multiple tests in a class
--------------------------------------------------------------

.. regendoc:wipe

Once you develop multiple tests, you may want to group them into a class. pytest makes it easy to create a class containing more than one test:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_class.py
    class TestClass:
        def test_one(self):
            x = "this"
            assert "h" in x

        def test_two(self):
            x = "hello"
            assert hasattr(x, "check")

``pytest`` discovers all tests following its :ref:`Conventions for Python test discovery <test discovery>`, so it finds both ``test_`` prefixed functions. There is no need to subclass anything, but make sure to prefix your class with ``Test`` otherwise the class will be skipped. We can simply run the module by passing its filename:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q test_class.py
    .F                                                                   [100%]
    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    ____________________________ TestClass.test_two ____________________________

    self = <test_class.TestClass object at 0xdeadbeef0001>

        def test_two(self):
            x = "hello"
    >       assert hasattr(x, "check")
    E       AssertionError: assert False
    E        +  where False = hasattr('hello', 'check')

    test_class.py:8: AssertionError
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_class.py::TestClass::test_two - AssertionError: assert False
    1 failed, 1 passed in 0.12s

The first test passed and the second failed. You can easily see the intermediate values in the assertion to help you understand the reason for the failure.

Grouping tests in classes can be beneficial for the following reasons:

 * Test organization
 * Sharing fixtures for tests only in that particular class
 * Applying marks at the class level and having them implicitly apply to all tests

Something to be aware of when grouping tests inside classes is that each test has a unique instance of the class.
Having each test share the same class instance would be very detrimental to test isolation and would promote poor test practices.
This is outlined below:

.. regendoc:wipe

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_class_demo.py
    class TestClassDemoInstance:
        value = 0

        def test_one(self):
            self.value = 1
            assert self.value == 1

        def test_two(self):
            assert self.value == 1


.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -k TestClassDemoInstance -q
    .F                                                                   [100%]
    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    ______________________ TestClassDemoInstance.test_two ______________________

    self = <test_class_demo.TestClassDemoInstance object at 0xdeadbeef0002>

        def test_two(self):
    >       assert self.value == 1
    E       assert 0 == 1
    E        +  where 0 = <test_class_demo.TestClassDemoInstance object at 0xdeadbeef0002>.value

    test_class_demo.py:9: AssertionError
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_class_demo.py::TestClassDemoInstance::test_two - assert 0 == 1
    1 failed, 1 passed in 0.12s

Note that attributes added at class level are *class attributes*, so they will be shared between tests.

Request a unique temporary directory for functional tests
--------------------------------------------------------------

``pytest`` provides :std:doc:`Builtin fixtures/function arguments <builtin>` to request arbitrary resources, like a unique temporary directory:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_tmp_path.py
    def test_needsfiles(tmp_path):
        print(tmp_path)
        assert 0

List the name ``tmp_path`` in the test function signature and ``pytest`` will lookup and call a fixture factory to create the resource before performing the test function call. Before the test runs, ``pytest`` creates a unique-per-test-invocation temporary directory:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest -q test_tmp_path.py
    F                                                                    [100%]
    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    _____________________________ test_needsfiles ______________________________

    tmp_path = PosixPath('PYTEST_TMPDIR/test_needsfiles0')

        def test_needsfiles(tmp_path):
            print(tmp_path)
    >       assert 0
    E       assert 0

    test_tmp_path.py:3: AssertionError
    --------------------------- Captured stdout call ---------------------------
    PYTEST_TMPDIR/test_needsfiles0
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_tmp_path.py::test_needsfiles - assert 0
    1 failed in 0.12s

More info on temporary directory handling is available at :ref:`Temporary directories and files <tmp_path handling>`.

Find out what kind of builtin :ref:`pytest fixtures <fixtures>` exist with the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --fixtures   # shows builtin and custom fixtures

Note that this command omits fixtures with leading ``_`` unless the ``-v`` option is added.

Historical Notes
================

This page lists features or behavior from previous versions of pytest which have changed over the years. They are
kept here as a historical note so users looking at old code can find documentation related to them.


.. _marker-revamp:

Marker revamp and iteration
---------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 3.6

pytest's marker implementation traditionally worked by simply updating the ``__dict__`` attribute of functions to cumulatively add markers. As a result, markers would unintentionally be passed along class hierarchies in surprising ways. Further, the API for retrieving them was inconsistent, as markers from parameterization would be stored differently than markers applied using the ``@pytest.mark`` decorator and markers added via ``node.add_marker``.

This state of things made it technically next to impossible to use data from markers correctly without having a deep understanding of the internals, leading to subtle and hard to understand bugs in more advanced usages.

Depending on how a marker got declared/changed one would get either a ``MarkerInfo`` which might contain markers from sibling classes,
``MarkDecorators`` when marks came from parameterization or from a ``node.add_marker`` call, discarding prior marks. Also ``MarkerInfo`` acts like a single mark, when it in fact represents a merged view on multiple marks with the same name.

On top of that markers were not accessible in the same way for modules, classes, and functions/methods.
In fact, markers were only accessible in functions, even if they were declared on classes/modules.

A new API to access markers has been introduced in pytest 3.6 in order to solve the problems with
the initial design, providing the :func:`_pytest.nodes.Node.iter_markers` method to iterate over
markers in a consistent manner and reworking the internals, which solved a great deal of problems
with the initial design.


.. _update marker code:

Updating code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The old ``Node.get_marker(name)`` function is considered deprecated because it returns an internal ``MarkerInfo`` object
which contains the merged name, ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` of all the markers which apply to that node.

In general there are two scenarios on how markers should be handled:

1. Marks overwrite each other. Order matters but you only want to think of your mark as a single item. E.g.
``log_level('info')`` at a module level can be overwritten by ``log_level('debug')`` for a specific test.

    In this case, use ``Node.get_closest_marker(name)``:

    .. code-block:: python

        # replace this:
        marker = item.get_marker("log_level")
        if marker:
            level = marker.args[0]

        # by this:
        marker = item.get_closest_marker("log_level")
        if marker:
            level = marker.args[0]

2. Marks compose in an additive manner. E.g. ``skipif(condition)`` marks mean you just want to evaluate all of them,
order doesn't even matter. You probably want to think of your marks as a set here.

   In this case iterate over each mark and handle their ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` individually.

   .. code-block:: python

        # replace this
        skipif = item.get_marker("skipif")
        if skipif:
            for condition in skipif.args:
                # eval condition
                ...

        # by this:
        for skipif in item.iter_markers("skipif"):
            condition = skipif.args[0]
            # eval condition


If you are unsure or have any questions, please consider opening
:issue:`an issue <new>`.

Related issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a non-exhaustive list of issues fixed by the new implementation:

* Marks don't pick up nested classes (:issue:`199`).

* Markers stain on all related classes (:issue:`568`).

* Combining marks - args and kwargs calculation (:issue:`2897`).

* ``request.node.get_marker('name')`` returns ``None`` for markers applied in classes (:issue:`902`).

* Marks applied in parametrize are stored as markdecorator (:issue:`2400`).

* Fix marker interaction in a backward incompatible way (:issue:`1670`).

* Refactor marks to get rid of the current "marks transfer" mechanism (:issue:`2363`).

* Introduce FunctionDefinition node, use it in generate_tests (:issue:`2522`).

* Remove named marker attributes and collect markers in items (:issue:`891`).

* skipif mark from parametrize hides module level skipif mark (:issue:`1540`).

* skipif + parametrize not skipping tests (:issue:`1296`).

* Marker transfer incompatible with inheritance (:issue:`535`).

More details can be found in the :pr:`original PR <3317>`.

.. note::

    in a future major release of pytest we will introduce class based markers,
    at which point markers will no longer be limited to instances of :py:class:`~pytest.Mark`.


cache plugin integrated into the core
-------------------------------------



The functionality of the :ref:`core cache <cache>` plugin was previously distributed
as a third party plugin named ``pytest-cache``.  The core plugin
is compatible regarding command line options and API usage except that you
can only store/receive data between test runs that is json-serializable.

.. _historical funcargs and pytest.funcargs:

funcargs and ``pytest_funcarg__``
---------------------------------



In versions prior to 2.3 there was no ``@pytest.fixture`` marker
and you had to use a magic ``pytest_funcarg__NAME`` prefix
for the fixture factory.  This remains and will remain supported
but is not anymore advertised as the primary means of declaring fixture
functions.


``@pytest.yield_fixture`` decorator
-----------------------------------



Prior to version 2.10, in order to use a ``yield`` statement to execute teardown code one
had to mark a fixture using the ``yield_fixture`` marker. From 2.10 onward, normal
fixtures can use ``yield`` directly so the ``yield_fixture`` decorator is no longer needed
and considered deprecated.


``[pytest]`` header in ``setup.cfg``
------------------------------------



Prior to 3.0, the supported section name was ``[pytest]``. Due to how
this may collide with some distutils commands, the recommended
section name for ``setup.cfg`` files is now ``[tool:pytest]``.

Note that for ``pytest.ini`` and ``tox.ini`` files the section
name is ``[pytest]``.


Applying marks to ``@pytest.mark.parametrize`` parameters
---------------------------------------------------------



Prior to version 3.1 the supported mechanism for marking values
used the syntax:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    @pytest.mark.parametrize(
        "test_input,expected", [("3+5", 8), ("2+4", 6), pytest.mark.xfail(("6*9", 42))]
    )
    def test_eval(test_input, expected):
        assert eval(test_input) == expected


This was an initial hack to support the feature but soon was demonstrated to be incomplete,
broken for passing functions or applying multiple marks with the same name but different parameters.

The old syntax is planned to be removed in pytest-4.0.


``@pytest.mark.parametrize`` argument names as a tuple
------------------------------------------------------



In versions prior to 2.4 one needed to specify the argument
names as a tuple.  This remains valid but the simpler ``"name1,name2,..."``
comma-separated-string syntax is now advertised first because
it's easier to write and produces less line noise.


setup: is now an "autouse fixture"
----------------------------------



During development prior to the pytest-2.3 release the name
``pytest.setup`` was used but before the release it was renamed
and moved to become part of the general fixture mechanism,
namely :ref:`autouse fixtures`


.. _string conditions:

Conditions as strings instead of booleans
-----------------------------------------



Prior to pytest-2.4 the only way to specify skipif/xfail conditions was
to use strings:

.. code-block:: python

    import sys


    @pytest.mark.skipif("sys.version_info >= (3,3)")
    def test_function(): ...

During test function setup the skipif condition is evaluated by calling
``eval('sys.version_info >= (3,0)', namespace)``.  The namespace contains
all the module globals, and ``os`` and ``sys`` as a minimum.

Since pytest-2.4 :ref:`boolean conditions <condition booleans>` are considered preferable
because markers can then be freely imported between test modules.
With strings you need to import not only the marker but all variables
used by the marker, which violates encapsulation.

The reason for specifying the condition as a string was that ``pytest`` can
report a summary of skip conditions based purely on the condition string.
With conditions as booleans you are required to specify a ``reason`` string.

Note that string conditions will remain fully supported and you are free
to use them if you have no need for cross-importing markers.

The evaluation of a condition string in ``pytest.mark.skipif(conditionstring)``
or ``pytest.mark.xfail(conditionstring)`` takes place in a namespace
dictionary which is constructed as follows:

* the namespace is initialized by putting the ``sys`` and ``os`` modules
  and the pytest ``config`` object into it.

* updated with the module globals of the test function for which the
  expression is applied.

The pytest ``config`` object allows you to skip based on a test
configuration value which you might have added:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.skipif("not config.getvalue('db')")
    def test_function(): ...

The equivalent with "boolean conditions" is:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.skipif(not pytest.config.getvalue("db"), reason="--db was not specified")
    def test_function():
        pass

.. note::

    You cannot use ``pytest.config.getvalue()`` in code
    imported before pytest's argument parsing takes place.  For example,
    ``conftest.py`` files are imported before command line parsing and thus
    ``config.getvalue()`` will not execute correctly.

``pytest.set_trace()``
----------------------



Previous to version 2.4 to set a break point in code one needed to use ``pytest.set_trace()``:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest


    def test_function():
        ...
        pytest.set_trace()  # invoke PDB debugger and tracing


This is no longer needed and one can use the native ``import pdb;pdb.set_trace()`` call directly.

For more details see :ref:`breakpoints`.

"compat" properties
-------------------



Access of ``Module``, ``Function``, ``Class``, ``Instance``, ``File`` and ``Item`` through ``Node`` instances have long
been documented as deprecated, but started to emit warnings from pytest ``3.9`` and onward.

Users should just ``import pytest`` and access those objects using the ``pytest`` module.

History
=======

pytest has a long and interesting history. The `first commit
<https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/commit/5992a8ef21424d7571305a8d7e2a3431ee7e1e23>`__
in this repository is from January 2007, and even that commit alone already
tells a lot: The repository originally was from the :pypi:`py`
library (later split off to pytest), and it
originally was a SVN revision, migrated to Mercurial, and finally migrated to
git.

However, the commit says “create the new development trunk” and is
already quite big: *435 files changed, 58640 insertions(+)*. This is because
pytest originally was born as part of `PyPy <https://www.pypy.org/>`__, to make
it easier to write tests for it. Here's how it evolved from there to its own
project:


-  Late 2002 / early 2003, `PyPy was
   born <https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2018/09/the-first-15-years-of-pypy.html>`__.
-  Like that blog post mentioned, from very early on, there was a big
   focus on testing. There were various ``testsupport`` files on top of
   unittest.py, and as early as June 2003, Holger Krekel (:user:`hpk42`)
   `refactored <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/pypy-dev/2003-June/000787.html>`__
   its test framework to clean things up (``pypy.tool.test``, but still
   on top of ``unittest.py``, with nothing pytest-like yet).
-  In December 2003, there was `another
   iteration <https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/commit/02752373e1b29d89c6bb0a97e5f940caa22bdd63>`__
   at improving their testing situation, by Stefan Schwarzer, called
   ``pypy.tool.newtest``.
-  However, it didn’t seem to be around for long, as around June/July
   2004, efforts started on a thing called ``utest``, offering plain
   assertions. This seems like the start of something pytest-like, but
   unfortunately, it's unclear where the test runner's code was at the time.
   The closest thing still around is `this
   file <https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/commit/0735f9ed287ec20950a7dd0a16fc10810d4f6847>`__,
   but that doesn’t seem like a complete test runner at all. What can be seen
   is that there were `various
   efforts <https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/commits/branch/default?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search=utest>`__
   by Laura Creighton and Samuele Pedroni (:user:`pedronis`) at automatically
   converting existing tests to the new ``utest`` framework.
-  Around the same time, for Europython 2004, @hpk42 `started a
   project <http://web.archive.org/web/20041020215353/http://codespeak.net/svn/user/hpk/talks/std-talk.txt>`__
   originally called “std”, intended to be a “complementary standard
   library” - already laying out the principles behind what later became
   pytest:

       -  current “batteries included” are very useful, but

          -  some of them are written in a pretty much java-like style,
             especially the unittest-framework
          -  […]
          -  the best API is one that doesn’t exist

       […]

       -  a testing package should require as few boilerplate code as
          possible and offer much flexibility
       -  it should provide premium quality tracebacks and debugging aid

       […]

       -  first of all … forget about limited “assertXYZ APIs” and use the
          real thing, e.g.::

              assert x == y

       -  this works with plain python but you get unhelpful “assertion
          failed” errors with no information

       -  std.utest (magic!) actually reinterprets the assertion expression
          and offers detailed information about underlying values

-  In September 2004, the ``py-dev`` mailinglist gets born, which `is
   now <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/pytest-dev/>`__ ``pytest-dev``,
   but thankfully with all the original archives still intact.

-  Around September/October 2004, the ``std`` project `was renamed
   <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/pypy-dev/2004-September/001565.html>`__ to
   ``py`` and ``std.utest`` became ``py.test``. This is also the first time the
   `entire source
   code <https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/commit/42cf50c412026028e20acd23d518bd92e623ac11>`__,
   seems to be available, with much of the API still being around today:

   -  ``py.path.local``, which is being phased out of pytest (in favour of
      pathlib) some 16-17 years later
   -  The idea of the collection tree, including ``Collector``,
      ``FSCollector``, ``Directory``, ``PyCollector``, ``Module``,
      ``Class``
   -  Arguments like ``-x`` / ``--exitfirst``, ``-l`` /
      ``--showlocals``, ``--fulltrace``, ``--pdb``, ``-S`` /
      ``--nocapture`` (``-s`` / ``--capture=off`` today),
      ``--collectonly`` (``--collect-only`` today)

-  In the same month, the ``py`` library `gets split off
   <https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/commit/6bdafe9203ad92eb259270b267189141c53bce33>`__
   from ``PyPy``

-  It seemed to get rather quiet for a while, and little seemed to happen
   between October 2004 (removing ``py`` from PyPy) and January
   2007 (first commit in the now-pytest repository). However, there were
   various discussions about features/ideas on the mailinglist, and
   :pypi:`a couple of releases <py/0.8.0-alpha2/#history>` every
   couple of months:

   -  March 2006: py 0.8.0-alpha2
   -  May 2007: py 0.9.0
   -  March 2008: py 0.9.1 (first release to be found `in the pytest
      changelog <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/doc/en/changelog.rst#091>`__!)
   -  August 2008: py 0.9.2

-  In August 2009, py 1.0.0 was released, `introducing a lot of
   fundamental
   features <https://holgerkrekel.net/2009/08/04/pylib-1-0-0-released-the-testing-with-python-innovations-continue/>`__:

   -  funcargs/fixtures
   -  A `plugin
      architecture <http://web.archive.org/web/20090629032718/https://codespeak.net/py/dist/test/extend.html>`__
      which still looks very much the same today!
   -  Various `default
      plugins <http://web.archive.org/web/20091005181132/https://codespeak.net/py/dist/test/plugin/index.html>`__,
      including
      `monkeypatch <http://web.archive.org/web/20091012022829/http://codespeak.net/py/dist/test/plugin/how-to/monkeypatch.html>`__

-  Even back there, the
   `FAQ <http://web.archive.org/web/20091005222413/http://codespeak.net/py/dist/faq.html>`__
   said:

       Clearly, [a second standard library] was ambitious and the naming has
       maybe haunted the project rather than helping it. There may be a
       project name change and possibly a split up into different projects
       sometime.

   and that finally happened in November 2010, when pytest 2.0.0 `was
   released <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/pytest-dev/2010-November/001687.html>`__
   as a package separate from ``py`` (but still called ``py.test``).

-  In August 2016, pytest 3.0.0 :std:ref:`was released <release-3.0.0>`,
   which adds ``pytest`` (rather than ``py.test``) as the recommended
   command-line entry point

Due to this history, it's difficult to answer the question when pytest was started.
It depends what point should really be seen as the start of it all. One
possible interpretation is to  pick Europython 2004, i.e. around June/July
2004.

.. module:: pytest

The ``pytest`` framework makes it easy to write small, readable tests, and can
scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.


``pytest`` requires: Python 3.8+ or PyPy3.

**PyPI package name**: :pypi:`pytest`

A quick example
---------------

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_sample.py
    def inc(x):
        return x + 1


    def test_answer():
        assert inc(3) == 5


To execute it:

.. code-block:: pytest

    $ pytest
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 1 item

    test_sample.py F                                                     [100%]

    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    _______________________________ test_answer ________________________________

        def test_answer():
    >       assert inc(3) == 5
    E       assert 4 == 5
    E        +  where 4 = inc(3)

    test_sample.py:6: AssertionError
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_sample.py::test_answer - assert 4 == 5
    ============================ 1 failed in 0.12s =============================

Due to ``pytest``'s detailed assertion introspection, only plain ``assert`` statements are used.
See :ref:`Get started <getstarted>` for a basic introduction to using pytest.


Features
--------

- Detailed info on failing :ref:`assert statements <assert>` (no need to remember ``self.assert*`` names)

- :ref:`Auto-discovery <test discovery>` of test modules and functions

- :ref:`Modular fixtures <fixture>` for managing small or parametrized long-lived test resources

- Can run :ref:`unittest <unittest>` (including trial) test suites out of the box

- Python 3.8+ or PyPy 3

- Rich plugin architecture, with over 1300+ :ref:`external plugins <plugin-list>` and thriving community

New pytest names in 2.0 (flat is better than nested)
----------------------------------------------------

If you used older version of the ``py`` distribution (which
included the py.test command line tool and Python name space)
you accessed helpers and possibly collection classes through
the ``py.test`` Python namespaces.  The new ``pytest``
Python module flatly provides the same objects, following
these renaming rules::

    py.test.XYZ          -> pytest.XYZ
    py.test.collect.XYZ  -> pytest.XYZ
    py.test.cmdline.main -> pytest.main

The old ``py.test.*`` ways to access functionality remain
valid but you are encouraged to do global renaming according
to the above rules in your test code.

Sponsor
=======

pytest is maintained by a team of volunteers from all around the world in their free time. While
we work on pytest because we love the project and use it daily at our daily jobs, monetary
compensation when possible is welcome to justify time away from friends, family and personal time.

Money is also used to fund local sprints, merchandising (stickers to distribute in conferences for example)
and every few years a large sprint involving all members.

pytest for enterprise
=====================

`Tidelift`_ is working with the maintainers of pytest and thousands of other
open source projects to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use
to build your applications. Save time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the
exact dependencies you use.

`Get more details <https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-pytest?utm_source=pypi-pytest&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise>`_

The Tidelift Subscription is a managed open source subscription for application dependencies covering millions of open source projects across JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, .NET, and more.

Your subscription includes:

* **Security updates**

  - Tidelift's security response team coordinates patches for new breaking security vulnerabilities and alerts immediately through a private channel, so your software supply chain is always secure.

* **Licensing verification and indemnification**

  - Tidelift verifies license information to enable easy policy enforcement and adds intellectual property indemnification to cover creators and users in case something goes wrong. You always have a 100% up-to-date bill of materials for your dependencies to share with your legal team, customers, or partners.

* **Maintenance and code improvement**

  - Tidelift ensures the software you rely on keeps working as long as you need it to work. Your managed dependencies are actively maintained and we recruit additional maintainers where required.

* **Package selection and version guidance**

  - Tidelift helps you choose the best open source packages from the start—and then guide you through updates to stay on the best releases as new issues arise.

* **Roadmap input**

  - Take a seat at the table with the creators behind the software you use. Tidelift's participating maintainers earn more income as their software is used by more subscribers, so they're interested in knowing what you need.

* **Tooling and cloud integration**

  - Tidelift works with GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and every cloud platform (and other deployment targets, too).

The end result? All of the capabilities you expect from commercial-grade software, for the full breadth of open
source you use. That means less time grappling with esoteric open source trivia, and more time building your own
applications—and your business.

"yield_fixture" functions
---------------------------------------------------------------





.. important::
    Since pytest-3.0, fixtures using the normal ``fixture`` decorator can use a ``yield``
    statement to provide fixture values and execute teardown code, exactly like ``yield_fixture``
    in previous versions.

    Marking functions as ``yield_fixture`` is still supported, but deprecated and should not
    be used in new code.
