# Quality Checklist: Rotation Strategies

## 1. Content Quality

- [X] All user stories include priority levels (P1, P2, P3)
- [X] Each user story explains why it has that priority
- [X] Each user story has "Independent Test" section
- [X] Edge cases are identified and documented
- [X] No implementation details leak into requirements
- [X] Language is clear and technology-agnostic
- [X] All placeholder sections have been filled out
- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

## 2. Requirement Completeness

- [X] All functional requirements use MUST/SHOULD/MAY consistently
- [X] Requirements are specific and testable
- [X] Key entities are identified (if applicable)
- [X] Success criteria are measurable and quantified
- [X] Dependencies on other features are documented
- [X] Assumptions are explicitly stated

## 3. Feature Readiness

- [X] At least one P1 user story is testable independently
- [X] Success criteria map to user stories
- [X] Requirements support all user stories
- [X] Edge cases don't block MVP (P1) delivery
- [X] Feature can be understood without additional context

## Validation Notes

✅ All checklist items verified against spec.md:

- All 6 user stories (US1-US6) have priorities (P1, P2, P3) with justifications
- Each user story includes "Independent Test" section
- Edge cases documented in dedicated section
- 22 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-022) use MUST/SHOULD/MAY
- 10 success criteria (SC-001 to SC-010) with quantified metrics
- Key entities identified: Rotation Strategy, Proxy Metadata, Session, Strategy Configuration, Selection Context
- Dependencies and Assumptions sections present
- Clarifications from 2025-10-29 session integrated into spec
