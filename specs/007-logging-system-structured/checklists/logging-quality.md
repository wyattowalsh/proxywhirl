# Logging Requirements Quality Checklist: Structured Logging System

**Purpose**: Validate completeness, clarity, and consistency of structured logging requirements before implementation
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Feature**: specs/007-logging-system-structured/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by `/speckit.checklist` to act as “unit tests for English” on the logging requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are structured log field requirements enumerated for every handler type so JSON/logfmt outputs always include timestamp, level, message, and context? [Completeness, Spec §US1; Spec §FR-006; Contracts/log-entry.schema.json]
- [ ] CHK002 Are configuration requirements covering console, file, syslog, and HTTP handlers including enable/disable flags, endpoints, credentials, and formatting options? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004; Spec §FR-005; Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK003 Are contextual logging requirements documenting mandatory metadata (request ID, proxy URL, strategy, health status) for each emitting subsystem? [Completeness, Spec §US4; Spec §FR-007; Spec §FR-016]
- [ ] CHK004 Are filtering and sampling capabilities fully defined with scope, configuration mechanisms, and operator controls? [Completeness, Spec §FR-018; Spec §FR-019]
- [ ] CHK005 Are runtime configuration reload rules explicit about precedence between environment variables and config files? [Completeness, Gap, Spec §FR-003]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 Is the structured log schema clear about required vs optional fields, data types, and encoding rules across formats? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001; Contracts/log-entry.schema.json]
- [ ] CHK007 Are rotation and retention triggers quantified with precise units (size, time, count) for both size- and time-based policies? [Clarity, Spec §US5; Spec §FR-009; Spec §FR-010; Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK008 Is the expected behavior of log sampling (drop policy, reporting) expressed with measurable thresholds or ratios? [Clarity, Gap, Spec §FR-019]
- [ ] CHK009 Are redaction rules precise about which fields are masked and the acceptable replacement format? [Clarity, Spec §FR-017; Plan §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK010 Are performance targets tied to defined environments and workloads so measurements are unambiguous? [Clarity, Spec §SC-003; Spec §SC-005; Plan §Performance Goals]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK011 Do runtime reload requirements align between user stories and success criteria (e.g., <1s effect, handler stability)? [Consistency, Spec §US2; Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK012 Are fallback expectations (stderr, warnings) consistent between remote handler scenarios and documented edge cases? [Consistency, Spec §US3; Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK013 Do contextual metadata requirements stay consistent with health monitoring outputs to avoid conflicting field semantics? [Consistency, Spec §US4; Spec §FR-016; Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK014 Are drop-counter requirements aligned with bounded queue behavior so dropped counts map to sampling/overflow policies? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases; Spec §FR-021]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK015 Can structured output acceptance scenarios be verified objectively through schema validation for all supported formats? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §US1; Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK016 Do runtime level-change scenarios define measurable outcomes for both increasing and decreasing verbosity? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §US2; Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK017 Are performance acceptance criteria linked to repeatable benchmark setups (data volume, concurrency, duration)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-003; Spec §SC-005; Plan §Testing]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK018 Are requirements covering cases where no handlers are configured or all handlers fail initialization? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK019 Are concurrent configuration reload scenarios during sustained high-volume logging addressed? [Coverage, Gap, Spec §SC-002; Spec §SC-005]
- [ ] CHK020 Are recovery behaviors specified for resuming normal logging after remote destination outages? [Coverage, Spec §US3; Spec §Edge Cases]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK021 Are serialization failure fallbacks documented for unhandled data types or circular references? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK022 Are disk-full or permission-denied file system scenarios covered for rotation and retention? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases; Spec §FR-013]
- [ ] CHK023 Are crash or signal handler logging requirements detailed for synchronous fallback paths? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK024 Are security and privacy requirements ensuring zero credential leakage fully specified with measurable expectations? [Non-Functional, Spec §FR-017; Spec §SC-007]
- [ ] CHK025 Are observability metrics (drop counters, queue size, handler errors) defined with reporting cadence and interfaces? [Non-Functional, Spec §FR-021; Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK026 Are availability and resiliency expectations (24/7 operation, rotation cleanup within target windows) measurable? [Non-Functional, Plan §Scale/Scope; Spec §SC-008; Spec §SC-010]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK027 Are integration expectations with Configuration Management (Feature 012) documented, including shared schema alignment? [Dependency, Spec §Dependencies; Plan §Summary]
- [ ] CHK028 Are assumptions about environment-variable availability validated or justified for deployment environments? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK029 Is the boundary with Health Monitoring (Feature 006) defined so each team knows ownership of health-context fields? [Dependency, Spec §Dependencies; Spec §FR-016]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK030 Is the “Draft” status resolved with approval criteria so requirements are considered authoritative? [Ambiguity, Spec Header]
- [ ] CHK031 Are qualitative terms such as “graceful degradation” and “bounded queue” defined to prevent conflicting interpretations? [Ambiguity, Spec §Edge Cases; Spec §FR-012; Plan §Constraints]
