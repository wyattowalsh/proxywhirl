# Specification Quality Checklist: Interactive Example Notebooks

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-11-02  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**: All items passed ✅

**Key Strengths**:

- Clear prioritization of user stories from P1 (Getting Started) to P3 (Quick Reference)
- Each user story is independently testable with specific acceptance scenarios
- Comprehensive functional requirements covering all notebook types and quality standards
- Measurable success criteria with quantifiable targets (5 minutes, 100% execution, 30+ snippets)
- Edge cases identified for common notebook execution issues
- Technology-agnostic language focusing on user value (learning, productivity, adoption)

**Ready for next phase**: `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
