`proxywhirl` is a web data extraction rotating proxy system. It loads and validates proxies from online sources, and serves them via a smart rotator. The rotator has a few extras including proxy list output and loader health reporting. `proxywhirl` can be used via [Python API](docs/usage#python-api), [CLI](docs/usage#command-line-interface-cli), or [TUI](docs/usage#terminal-user-interface-tui)
