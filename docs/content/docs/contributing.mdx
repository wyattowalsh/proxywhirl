# Contributing to proxywhirl

Thank you for your interest in contributing to proxywhirl! We welcome contributions from everyone. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our code of conduct.

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or improving documentation to submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into proxywhirl itself.

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue on our GitHub repository. Please include as much detail as possible, including:

- A clear and descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce the bug.
- The expected behavior and what actually happened.
- Your environment details (OS, Python version, proxywhirl version).

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate our efforts and avoid duplicating work.

### Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests.

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, **add tests**.
3.  If you've changed APIs, **update the documentation**.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes (`make test`).
5.  Make sure your code lints (`make lint`).
6.  **Issue that pull request!**

## Development Workflow

Set up your development environment:

```bash
# Clone your fork and navigate to the directory
git clone https://github.com/your-username/proxywhirl.git
cd proxywhirl

# Set up the development environment
make setup

# Run the complete quality pipeline
make quality
```

### Available Make Targets

- `make help` - Show all available commands
- `make setup` - Create virtual environment and sync all dependencies  
- `make test` - Run all tests with coverage
- `make format` - Format code with black and isort
- `make lint` - Run all linters (ruff, pylint, mypy)
- `make quality` - Complete pipeline: format → lint → test
- `make docs-dev` - Start documentation development server
- `make clean` - Clean up build artifacts and cache

## CI/CD Pipeline

proxywhirl uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Here's what happens automatically:

### Automated Testing
When you create a pull request or push to `main`/`dev` branches:

1. **Quality Checks** - Runs `make quality` pipeline:
   - Code formatting (black + isort)
   - Linting (ruff + pylint + mypy)
   - Full test suite with coverage
2. **Security Scanning** - Checks dependencies for vulnerabilities
3. **Integration Tests** - Optional comprehensive testing (add `run-integration` label)

### Branch Strategy
- **`main`** - Production-ready code, protected branch
- **`dev`** - Integration branch for feature development
- **Feature branches** - Created from `dev`, merged via pull request

### Release Process
Releases are fully automated:

1. Update version in `pyproject.toml`
2. Create version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`) 
3. GitHub Actions automatically:
   - Runs full test suite
   - Publishes to PyPI
   - Creates GitHub release
   - Updates documentation

### Status Checks
Your PR must pass these checks before merging:
- ✅ Code formatting and linting
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Security audit clean
- ✅ Documentation builds successfully

  **Pro Tip**: Run `make quality` locally before pushing to catch issues early and save CI time.
